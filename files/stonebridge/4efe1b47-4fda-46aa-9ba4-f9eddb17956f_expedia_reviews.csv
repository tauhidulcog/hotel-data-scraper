"It would have been nice to know at some point beforehand that this building is under construction. There was open wallpaper, unfinished walls, the ""store"" area was completely unstocked, and parking was limited due to storage and construction equipment taking up spots.
It also would have been nice to know before hand that there was a parking fee. 
As for the room, it was fine. The living area was a bit crowded with all the furniture they crammed in there. The outlets didn't work on my bedside table. The door wasn't hung right. Every time we left we had to turn the handle from the inside, then turn the handle from the outside to hold the latch inside the door, then lift the door. Otherwise it would just bang AND bounce back open. They did eventually fix it right before we left.  There was random power tool noises outside our door on Saturday, but no evidence of what they were working on. For a full kitchen, it wasn't stocked very well as far as cooking; one pot, one pan, nothing to bake in/with.  We've stayed other places with a full cook set and at least one baking pan and cooking sheet.
They did have a decent breakfast, and the front desk did their best to help when we asked.
Overall, it was not what I've come to expect from a Residence Inn, but I would be willing to give them another shot after the construction is done.",6,Joseph,2025-10-06

"We have arrived late. Didn’t know about the paid parking and got a vague description of it from the person at the desk. We were given a room that had an extremely noisy boiler. This was at around 1:30 in the morning so we needed to sleep. Eventually, I went downstairs and said I needed a new room because we needed to sleep and we did get the room. Ended up sleeping well after that. Then, in the morning found out that the fitness room was closed for renovation, which a lot of the hotels seem to be. I was able to use the hotel next-door, but all in all the hotel definitely did not seem welcoming, organize, or well-maintained. ",6,Irene,2025-08-25

"The furniture in the room was disheveled and worn, there were old candies under the pull out couch, items left in the recycle bin and old food sitting in the disposal. The microwave didn’t work. Building was under construction and noisy. Charge $16 for parking and not enough parking spots available at the hotel, when brought up to staff was advised to park on the street or at the hotel next door. ",6,Verified traveler,2025-07-18

The hotel was undergoing renovations. This was fine. But our room was not ready at 3. We did get one of the newer rooms which was great for 5 of us with the kitchen and two rooms. House keeping came day two and did not do a good job. The did not give new towels to one of the rooms and the floor did not get swept. The second time they came was much better but I requested the floor to be cleaned and then had to ask for more toilet paper. The towels at the pool were not regularly replenished either. The breakfast was great and the room was very nice.  ,6,Lauren,2025-06-26
"Marriott corporate kept this property open during major renovation. While the staff was great, the property itself is very run down. Because of the construction happening, it was very noisy and hallways were dirty. Sleep during the day was impossible and I night there was some truck noise as well. In my room some lights and fans did not work and the mattresses were in poor shape ",4,Roxanne,2025-06-23

"The rooms were accommodating but with the construction going on, the elevators and other areas were not clean. Also, I had to leave a day early due to a family emergency and the hotel refused to refund me for the night I didn’t stay when my colleague who left early as well was refunded for the night he didn't stay. I wish the hotel was more understanding!!! ",6,Dennis,2025-05-24
"We were told when we arrived that they had overbooked and we needed to go to the hotel across the parking lot (both under Marriott). They didnt help with bags, the parking lot was difficult to negotiate and we went from a booked suite with a king size bed to a lesser room with two queen beds. They offered no compensation and the origimal hotel was not very nice about the situation.  The hotel we ended up at had breakfast for a fee but they said we could walk to the other hotel for a free breakfast. Not happy. I complained to Marriott.",2,Linda,2025-05-22

And to top it off they didn’t even do room service for fresh towels and make the bed. This was the place have stayed in. I should have went down the road after first night.",4,David,2025-01-22

"We booked the stay more than a month in advance yet when we arrived at 9p to check in they said the room wasn’t ready and they were cleaning it. We had three tired kids with us and needed to be up at 3a to check out and head to the airport so this was very inconvenient. Thx room was not very clean or comfortable, the furnishing were old, and the sofa bed mattress had big stains all over it so my son just slept on the small sofa. The upstairs neighbors were loud and had kids running around for several hours in the night. The front desk offered nothing for this except to say they wouldn’t charge us for parking. Terrible hotel with lousy service and accommodations. Wasn’t even cheap! Would never book again and wouldn’t recommend to anyone!",2,Mona,2024-10-08

"I was not impressed with the property for a number of reasons. Overall the hallways and rooms just looked run down. The furniture in my room had stains, the leather was torn on the chairs, there were broken drawers in dressers, and there was a chunk missing from my kitchen flooring. The shower head and tub had staining. The pillows were also rather uncomfortable and only half the size of normal pillows. There were also some electrical issues in my room and a few light switches didn’t work. I could also hear my upstairs and next to neighbors. All that said, the area was convenient - close to the airport and a few restaurants in walking distance. The staff were also very nice. However I would not stay here again and I would not recommend it ",4,Lindsey,2024-09-15
Very good facility.  The gym was very small and the hot tub not properly heated.,8,David,2024-09-13
We had the wrong time for breakfast which ended at 9am. My husband got  down at 9 exactly and the woman had already taken almost all of the food away. My husband did get some bacon and eggs. The bacon was delicious thankful my husband shared with me. I came down 9:03 and could not get anything. The staff member was very curt and would not accommodate at all. The woman at the front desk was great. ,8,Karen,2024-09-11
The property was fine. The hallways were not vacuumed and there were dead moths for our four day stay. More each day. I had to take pictures it was so gross. The parking lot was overflowing and we had to park in fire lanes. And you have to pay a daily rate for parking. My EarPods went missing during the stay and the front desk did not return calls. I won’t stay her again. ,6,Patrick,2024-09-09

It was also an easy walk to several restaurants and cocktails.

"It was convenient to the airport. We had to leave earlier than breakfast started so I can’t speak to that. The desk staff were really nice. The room was a really good size. The kitchen was pretty good if you needed that.  The carpet had that sticky hotel feel that turns your feet black and was really sticky in front of the couch like something had been spilled but never adequately cleaned up. The mattress on the pull out was very stained and they don’t provide a mattress pad. 
The lobby was really nice and it looked like the breakfast area was nice. 
We probably wouldn’t choose this hotel again. ",6,Patricia E,2024-06-29

"We chose this hotel because of the shuttle but the shuttle stopped 30 minutes early, no one answered the phone at the hotel (I called 16 times) then the next morning there are only 4 slots every 30 minutes for the airport shuttle- you must reserve early.  If you are choosing this hotel for airport convenience think again.  Marriott went cheap on the shuttle service- I saw shuttles for the Hyatt and Hilton affiliated hotels multiple times while waiting for Marriott.  Book them instead.  ",2,Jacquelyn,2024-02-17
Very nice hotel,10,Greg Jolliff,2024-02-14
The room was very clean & had a comfortable bed. They were having issues with the internet so we couldn’t watch any streaming networks (Netflix or Prime Video). For a 3 night stay that was pretty unacceptable. The breakfast was good but the coffee was cold every am so we just made it in our room. The breakfast dining area needs attention with peeling wallpaper type things. I didn’t like using Hotels.com. The reservationists at the hotel won’t touch the booking if you want them to make changes since a “3rd party” did it. They said you have to call hotels.com but when you do they say they’re having technical problems so call back. Ugh.so my advice is to book directly with the hotel,6,Rebecca,2024-02-12
"The staff was great.  The room was pretty big.  A few items that bothered us.  If you used your room key to enter from the back door, it wouldn't work to let you in your room. Apparently it's a safety feature.  That is a hassle when you park in the back and are staying for 4 days and have to go to the front desk every time.

I had wanted to rent a home but we wound up staying here and it turned out to be the best thing.  There are many long term residents, and we made friends.  It was so great to have a community while away from home.  The staff, the other residents, everybody was just lovely, knew our names, asked after our mom each day.

" UC Anschutz hospital is a relatively short drive if you have a family member in the hospital. The hotel has various restaurants within walking distance if you do not want to cook. However, there is a microwave, full refrigerator and a 2- burner glass top to cook meals. The front staff was very helpful and friendly. The morning breakfast was very complete- there was something for everyone's appetite...even the decaf coffee was good 😉 There was not an ice machine on any of the floors b/c there were full-sized refrigerators in the room.
