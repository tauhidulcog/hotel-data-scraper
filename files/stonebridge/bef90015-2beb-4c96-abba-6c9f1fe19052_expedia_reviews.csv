"Nice hotel.  We were able to check in early and got an accessible room.  If you are worried about slipping on a bathroom floor, don't get an accessible room as the shower is roll-in enabled.  I got water on the slick tile floor despite my best efforts and it was slippery.  Also found a very long hair in the sink and in the shower that didn't belong to me.  I went to use the pool and found it a bit cold and a bit green and cloudy so I didn't use the pool.  Like many of the shops and hotels along the Coastal Highway, there is only one way out of the parking lot.  If you want to go in the opposite direction you need to go down and turn around- which can be a bit of a nuisance when the hwy is busy which it often is.  It was a quiet hotel and we had a wonderful view of trees from our room on the back side of the hotel.  The breakfast was very good and hot.  The coffee was always hot too any time of day.  The staff were friendly and helpful. ",8,Carolyn,2025-10-07
"Main issue is the strong smell in the room, a mix of cleaning sprays and musty air from the A/C unit.  I am also not sure all the pillowcases were changed after the last occupant.  Finally, the eggs and sausage at breakfast tasted awful.  ",6,Fay,2025-09-29
The staff was very accommodating. Room equip for Handicapped needs was excellent.  Breakfast good.  AC very noisy and the bed was not as comfortable as in the past. Lots of highway traffic. Would I stay again.  Most certainly. ,8,Gloria,2025-09-28

Rooms/bathrooms could be updated.  Good breakfast. I would advise all guests to review their final BILL as $8 was added to mine for someone charging snacks to my room.  It was removed but it left a bad taste.  This should not happen and the hotel needs to update their policy.,8,Joseph,2025-09-14

"Wonderful in every way! Clean, comfortable, newer and in good condition. Quiet nights sleep even though we were right next to the elevator. Surprisingly good breakfast (I'm generally not a fan of hotel breakfasts!). Beautiful deck eating area as well. We were already happy but realized a couple of hours after checking out that we had left a precious piece of jewelry in the room! Called and the front desk person went to the room and found it for us and was so kind about it!",10,Megan,2025-09-07
"Besides the unhealthy handling of
 breakfast server who chose not to wear gloves while taking bread,muffins and bagels out of containers or replacing any food in dining room the hotel and desk service was great.

"Cleaning the room was terrible . Bathroom wasn’t cleaned.  Garbage wasn’t thrown out from garbage pails. Sheets on the bed weren’t changed , we made the bed before we left . When we returned in the evening found the bed sheets weren’t changed. I know room service was  every  other day . Don’t know why they even bothered .  I think for over350. Per night , could have been better. Breakfast was ok!
Someone could have vacuum the pool to get the sand out That someone left. It was there for two days.",8,Robert,2025-08-10

I was disappointed in the breakfast options. I’m not a fan of turkey meat. I’m at the hotel on vacation. I should not only have healthy choice of meat. They should have regular meat sausage. The breakfast was the worst part of my stay. ,8,William,2025-03-01

"Check-in was easy and the front desk worker, Michelle, was sweet and great. Overnight there was a false fire alarm that went off in my room and the adjoining room. Evacuated down to the lobby with my small child and the overnight front desk worker was trying to solve the issue. They tried calling their managers but the managers didn’t answer, the security alarm company could not assist, so another guest had to call local fire department to respond to reset the fire alarm and panel.

This took almost 2 hours that I was out of my room with a small child from midnight until almost 2am. There was no follow up from hotel staff, no one at the desk when I checked out I could speak to, and I overall was extremely disappointed with this stay, this inconvenience, and also a dirty bathroom with moldy/mildew shower curtain and shower space. Being a Marriott Bonvoy member and this hotel being associated with that rewards program, I would not stay here again. It does not rate well with my other experiences at Marriott Bonvoy affiliated properties.",4,Laura,2024-09-15
"Great staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Check in process was quick and easy. Hotel had been recently renovated inside and out. Plenty of parking. Spacious suite with a mini fridge, microwave, sofa, work desk and task chair. Also included two 50” TVs. Deluxe breakfast included. Lower level has a heated, indoor pool, cocktail lounge and sundeck. Very nice, leisurely stay. Approximately 2 miles to Rehoboth Avenue and the beach. Enjoyed the trip so much, we added an additional night’s stay.",10,Christopher,2024-09-14

"This is a relatively new Fairfield property and I was not disappointed. The rooms and public areas were clean, modern, and well-kept. The dining area looks out over a small wet land, which is much better than a parking lot or road. And having a pool and evening bar is a nice touch.

Rehoboth Beach is notorious for its traffic but the hotel has a back way to reach the beach without going through the traffic. Awesome! Staff was very friendly and hotel is convenient tio beaches and shops. Highly recommend.",10,Joseph,2024-09-05

Nice location to stay  if you are visiting Rehoboth Beach. It's a few miles from the boad walk but you can catch the  Dart Bus right across from the hotel to the board walk. The  bus from the board walk also stops right in front of the hotel. This way you can avoid  the parking  problem around the Beach. You download the app for the Bart bus and pay for a day pass for multiple trips during the day. ,10,Wisdom,2024-05-28

He did not offer me another room and told me it had to get done before the summer thus making me feel like my vacation was not important.

"This hotel is clean and comfortable and I’d recommend staying here. There was one issue with hot water in bathroom sink. It wasn’t always hot but the shower water was always hot. I’m not sure if this was an issue because the hotel was sold out for Memorial Day weekend and too many people were using the water at the same time. Otherwise, the stay was great.
