"O quarto estava sempre limpo e as arrumadeiras eram simpáticas . O café da manhã era muito farto e bom. O chuveiro é ótimo, mas o colchão não era firme e doeu minha coluna. As molas faziam barulho e havia uma leve depressão no colchão ( um dip ) no quarto 3404. Falei para eles sobre o problema e sugeri que mudassem o colchão para que os próximos hóspedes não passassem pelo o que eu passei. Também durante as 5 noites q passei hospedada não pude usar o banheiro do lobby pq disseram estar estragado. Daí se o hóspede estiver no lobby e precisar usar o banheiro, tem q pegar o elevador e ir em seu quarto. Imagine sempre só 2 elevadores funcionando para 390 quartos + ou - . Eu tive a vantagem de ter uma vista linda da cidade ( andar 34 ) , mas a desvantagem de esperar as vezes por 10 a 15 minutos para descer ou subir.",8,Eny,2025-10-07
Breakfast is routine stuff and very limited options. And rooms are not tidy. One of the lift is dysfunctional ,6,Devaraja,2025-10-06
"The hotel was nice, but getting in and out via the elevators was problematic. It took us over 15 minutes to get an elevator - they kept passing our floor both on the way up and down - not stopping. Worst in the morning, but a problem at other points in the day as well. Otherwise, stay was ok. ",8,Jennifer,2025-10-06

Room wasn’t ready at nearly 6pm. Had to wait 20 minutes for “the room to be ready”. Elevators were broken for 2 days and we were on the 22nd floor. One elevator working took 15-35 minutes and there was practically a riot in the lobby.  ,2,PATRICIA,2025-10-05

"My checking was refused by the hotel. Orbitz refuses to refund because reservation was non refundable.

"This was a clean, easy stay for us. Walkable to Times Square and Broadway. Like others have mentioned, there was sometimes a wait for the elevator but not more than 5-10 minutes. Included breakfast was great although crowded on the weekend and you may have to wait for a table to open up. Overall we would definitely stay here again. ",8,Krista,2025-10-02

"I booked the hotel based on its ratings and reviews. We arrived before check-in time, but there wasn't even a restroom, and we waited an hour and a half to use it. After checking in, I think they'd given our room to another guest, and suddenly someone came into our room, which made us feel very unsafe. Later, a hotel employee bothered us again to get our information. In short, the location is nice, but we weren't satisfied.",4,Simay,2025-09-29

"Breakfast was great every morning. Tommy 



Everything was great… breakfast exceeded expectations.  
Staff was friendly and very helpful.
Our only frustration  were the elevators. It appeared to us that only two of the three were working for the most part.
We often had to wait as the elevator didn’t even stop on our floor as it was full. At least we got a bit more exercise using the stairs.

"Everything was fine in the room and at breakfast. But there is one thing I have not encountered in any other hotel and I have been to many of them. The wait for the elevator in the morning was terrible and I often stood in line for 25 minutes as the elevators passed the floor (35) and did not stop at all because they were full. It is difficult to understand that a hotel with 40 floors is run with only 2 elevators, there are 3 but one worked only part of one day out of the 6 that I was with you, its owner was also slow and there was a long line. I can tell you that on the last day I gave up breakfast because I was afraid that waiting as I was used to, I would miss my flight.",6,ahuva,2025-09-22

One elevator was down hence a real nightmare to go up and down with long queues, I was fortunate to be on 4th floor still walking up not ideal.

"I experienced several unpleasant issues during my stay. The most upsetting occurred when I tried to access the rooftop at 8:58 PM, two minutes before the posted closing time of 9:00 PM, to take a few photos of the city lights. A service staff member immediately shouted:
""IT IS CLOSED! GET OUT!""
When I politely asked to take a couple of pictures, he repeated the same aggressive words and approached me in a threatening manner. I felt frightened and reported the incident to reception.

The receptionist said the rooftop was managed by a third party. As the same staff member entered the lobby, I pointed him out. The receptionist called Guest Service Manager Mr. E.J., who first listened to the staff member, then asked why I was on the rooftop after closing. I explained I was there before 9:00 PM, as stated in the hotel’s own info. He dismissed my explanation and blamed me, saying I had ""plenty of time during the day"" to take pictures. I found his lack of empathy and professionalism shocking.

Other issues included:

Shower head detached from the wall (I have pictures)

Elevator delays – several 20+ min waits as elevators passed my floor full

Smell of smoke in the room upon each entry

On a positive note, front desk staff were kind and the simple breakfast was good. However, Mr. J.'s behavior greatly undermined the overall experience. I expected more from a hotel of this standard and hope this feedback helps avoid similar incidents for future guests.",2,Kaare,2025-09-06

"Ho soggiornato 5 notti ad agosto.
Sicuramente fino a un ora e mezza dopo l'orario di apertura della colazione, la stessa veniva continuamente rifornira ed era abbondante (dopo non lo so perché uscivo).
Stavo al 40° e ultimo piano. Nei momento della colazione c'era un po di attesa per l'ascensore,  ma nulla di preoccupante (al max  un paio di volte ho atteso 15 min).
Verso le 17:00 fanno un apertivo. Ho partecipato una volte ed è  stato soddisfacente (ho trovato birra buonissima, vino, olive, pane e formaggi).
La zona in cui si trova l'hotel l'ho trovata sicura, puoi uscire tranquillamente la sera e sei subito in centro.
Camera pulita. Reception disponibile ad ogni esigenza.
Acqua, te e caffe sono praticamente sempre  disponibili.
Una sera al rientro in hotel erano disponibili alla hall tre tisane buonissime e pronte da bere.
Da italiano lo CONSIGLIO!!! Ottima esperienza!

"Almost everything was very good. Strategically located. They had some work improvements made to the WiFi & TV that resulted in an inconsistent service at time and one of the three elevators was out of service, which caused a serious traffic congestion during breakfast peak time. I believe that when these issues are finally resolved the rating should increase to excellent. Service personnel was friendly and helpful. I would consider this place for any future visits to NY.",10,Badel,2025-08-31
"Hotel was in a good central location. Breakfast was better than expected, with different hot items each day. Evening snacks and drinks midweek were nice. Room was ok, but floor was not very clean. There is a problem with the lifts, but we didn't have to wait too long even though we opted for a high floor for the view. ",8,Clare,2025-08-30

"Element NY Times Square West is a very nice contemporary styled hotel located right next to the Times Square as the name suggests. The subway station and bus terminal are close by and within short walking distance.

We opted for a room with the view. It’s very clean and comfortable. There were some gremlins here and there, but the hotel staff was able to fix them pretty quickly.

There are 3 elevators on site, but one is not working. I guess it hasn’t been working for months based on previous reviews. During peak hours like breakfast time, check-out and check-in hours, there were times we would wait for over 10 minutes. During those times, they had a staff member who controlled the elevator. And sometimes they would express the elevator past our floor a few times before the elevator stopped on our floor. Otherwise, the wait wasn’t that bad.

They served a full breakfast with a large variety of options. The staff at the dining room was friendly, efficient, and kept the place clean and humming. They even had happy hours there Monday through Thursday serving wine and beer. The rooftop is small but offers a near-panoramic view of the city. There’s also a gym at the basement which was very well stocked with almost every exercise equipment you’d need.

Overall, I had a great experience and I will definitely consider staying there again when I visit NY. ",8,James,2025-08-30

"Great Potential in This Hotel- but Needs to Work Out the Kinks. Stayed here during AnimeNYC. Hotel is clean and gives included breakfast. One elevator had maintenance, so only two were running. I feel like even with three the elevators are a huge problem for this 40 floor hotel. We would wait twenty minutes for an elevator that ended up being full to capacity. People would get tired of waiting and cram into one elevator unsafely. Beyond that, amenities were good. There was no option for late check out without a huge fee, but then leaving bags at the front desk seemed like an annoyance to the staff. Also, our keycards stopped working at one point out of no where. My brother was locked out and he had to wait for someone to open it- which took a while due to the elevator issue. I would stay here again but only after all these issues are resolved.",8,Julianna,2025-08-28

"For the price compared to the others in the area, I don’t think it hits it’s bar compared to a similar rooms which where 20% cheaper.

Cons: 
- Had an accessibility room. The shower was way too narrow. The shower head was a handle with a mount that was not tall enough for a 5’9” man to stand under (had to crouch)
- Sharp metal on shower, easy to cut yourself
- TP roll was not in the holder (locked like a public restroom) 
- The bathroom fan was not running, room would get a bad mildew smell.

Pros
- Nice coffee area in room with bottled water
- Large fridge
- Free makeup remover

Overall i enjoyed my stay.  Our room was very nice- more spacious than I'd expect in an NYC hotel.   It was clean.  The rooftop area was a nice touch. The elevator situation was mildly irritating especially with one of them out of commission.   And the water was scalding hot - not in a good way.

The only downside is one elevator wasn’t working so we had to walk thousands of stairs downstairs for breakfast as the elevator would take a long time to reach our floor. They warned us when we checked in so we expected this.finding a working elevator to go up wasn’t an issue it was just to go down. There was also an issue with the water turning really hot randomly when showering. It was very frustrating dealing with that. They addressed the issue when we reported and taught us how to deal with it if the water turns hot again. Overall, i would stay here again and recommend this hotel to others. ",8,Kamsey,2025-08-19

"Sem dúvidas eu recomendo pra quem está buscando um excelente custo benefício.

Localização muito boa, com fácil acesso à tudo na região da Times Square. Pelo que vi em alguns comentários, imaginei que fosse encontrar vários moradores de rua acampados na porta, o que não foi o caso. Vi eles sim, mas o normal de qualquer grande centro urbano.

Não tem nenhuma tx na recepção, somente caução de 250 usd. Café da manhã incluso, com boas opções de pães, bolos, bagel(todos os dias) panqueca, waffle, cookies, rabanada etc (alternadamente). De frios somente queijo e presunto. Café comum e complementos, 3 tipos de sucos, cereais e frutas. Do café estilo americano, linguiça ou hambúrguer, ovos mexidos ou omelete, batata salteada, pepino e tomate. Senti falta de bacon rs. O melhor é que tem grab & go. 

De segunda a quinta, de 17h as 18:30h servem de cortesia 2 tipos de cerveja(excelentes) e opção de vinho(não experimentei), além de petiscos, como queijos, azeitona, pipoca e pão. Isso eu nunca tinha visto em hotel nenhum kkk

O quarto bem limpo, com excelente isolamento acústico, chuveiro forte e quente, cama boa, cozinha completa, utensílios, sem cheiro de mofo, com café, chás e 2 garrafas de água mineral por dia, disponíveis de cortesia.

O único contra mesmo ficou por conta do elevador, que de fato é demorado nos horários de pico. O hotel inclusive já informa sobre a situação na chegada. São 3 e somente 2 estão em operação. Eu fiquei no andar 39, mas nenhuma vez utilizei escadas. ",10,VALMOR,2025-08-10

"Very good location in the middle of times square. The rooms are actually pretty nice, stayed there a couple of times. The breakfast is also quite decent, but way to crowded and you eat because you have to, not because you enjoy it, but you you have everything you need. The elevators is a big issue, they can't handle the amount of people living in the hotel. One of three elevators were out of service though. We choose to walk down the stairs from 30th instead, probably not a good idea after all the pancakes that week. 
We had prepayed our room for 1 week, and get delayed first day due to delay of flight. When we arrived at 1am they had sold our room, overbooked intentionally and we had no were to sleep. But a serviceminded night worker opened up a room that was renovating with no shower, but we got to sleep and got a new room the day after.

"I'm a Japanese who stayed with two people until 7/31.

When I checked out, an African-American person responded to me, Compared to responding to white people with a smile, he deliberately spoke English at a speed that we couldn't understand, and pretended not to hear even though he could hear the room number, which was extremely uncomfortable.

Taking such an attitude towards us Japanese was a blatant challenge to us, and at the same time, I didn't think we wanted to stay again.

It can be said that it is not worth paying hundreds of thousands of yen to stay at all.

What kind of education have you received at higher education institutions such as your family or university? I didn't think they were from the same developed country.

The hotel will know the name of the employee who responded on 7/31, so I would like to ask the hotel to respond to penalties without overlooking it.

Otherwise, when they come to Japan, we will just respond in the same way.",2,Tomomi,2025-08-02

"Very good breakfast. Great location.

Full kitchenette compared to other closet size rooms in other Yotels :-) in area was nice. The fridge freezer which allowed us to keep ice and drinks was definitely a plus. 

Staff were friendly, but didn't clean our room on day 2 of 3 so we had to request clean towels. 

No ice machines, but was told to ask the kitchen for ice,and it was provided to us, and lasted our entire stay in the rooms freezer. 

Wife slept well, but as a light sleeper, I typically run hotel A/C fan to provide ambient noise to aid me in sleeping. Unfortunately, the odd noises randomly emulating form the A/C unit which is right by the bed kept me awake every night which was a problem. Summer... so turning it off was not an option.

The shower was clean and the water flow was ample, but shower floor sloped away from the drain causing used shower water to pool. This was gross on day two when I had to step into the previous days shower water, but not on day 3 after they cleaned and drained it out, so would not had been an issue if the had only cleaned on day 2.

Only 2 of 3 elevators worked. They are fast, but small. Catching one with room for you party/bags was most always time consuming and inconvenient. The lobby had no elevator queues and thus it was a was a free for all. Often inconsiderate persons cut in front those patiently waiting and took their spots or failed to squeeze in to make room. I would not use again or recommend to others until this is resolved.",8,John,2025-07-27

O quarto também conta com uma cozinha completa: panelas, talheres, copos, xícaras e outros utensílios, o que foi um ótimo diferencial.

Chegamos por volta das 14h e conseguimos fazer o check-in sem custo adicional. Os atendentes eram sempre muito educados e atenciosos. O café da manhã é bem servido, considerando o padrão americano, e após o horário ainda disponibilizam garrafinhas de água para os hóspedes.

A localização é excelente — conseguimos fazer muita coisa a pé. Há um 7-Eleven na esquina e uma Target bem próxima, o que facilitou bastante.

O único ponto de atenção foi o elevador: como estávamos em um andar alto e um dos três elevadores estava em manutenção, às vezes a espera era um pouco longa.

Personale non professionale alla reception, commesso errori e non fatto nulla per rimediare. Tutto per poca professionalità e disattenzione. Non credo che soggiornerò di nuovo all'Element",2,monica,2025-06-25

"En general bueno y volvería. El problema que deben resolver y, por lo que pude identificar tanto por empleados como por huéspedes recurrentes, es el servicio de ascensores. Dos unidades para 40 pisos, incluyendo uso para el servicio, es muy deficiente. En muchas ocasiones hay que llamar por celular al lobby para que se comuniquen por WhatsApp con los operadores de los elevadores, para que recojan a los huéspedes en sus respectivos pisos.

"Hotel com boa localização, pertinho da Times Square, da pra fazer muita coisa a pé. Quarto bem amplo, com ótima cama e banheiro. Tem uma mini cozinha e geladeira, ponto muito positivo, já que vi que em NY a maioria dos hotéis os quartos são pequenos. Só não dei nota 5, porque o café da manhã não tinha muitas opções, não é gostoso e era uma luta pra encontrar lugar pra sentar pra poder comer, mesmo chegando muito cedo, em razão disso passamos a tomar café da manhã na rua, já que no hotel era essa dificuldade com café que não nos agradou. Além disso, se for hospedar nesse hotel tenha em mente que terá que usar sempre as escadas, porque o elevador está sempre congestionado. Ficaria novamente no hotel, mas sem pagar o café da manhã e num andar mais baixo.",6,Jane,2025-06-22

It was so frustrating to wait and wait while multiple elevators whizzes past without stopping, then when one does, it opens up to be completely full. The stairs were so tight that it was hard not to be dizzy walking. In the room, the air conditioner was like a tractor trailer truck that idled in the room on and off all night.",2,Michael,2025-06-21

We had gone down to the ground floor to use the restroom and saw cockroaches.   Also, our bed sloped to the right and the air units were loud, so made it uncomfortable sleeping.  ",6,Nancy,2025-06-14

Other than that I think the rooms are spacious, the bus terminal is a walk away. I flew in from JFK and it took about an hour via subway to get to the hotel. I was able to check in early and I seen if early check in wasn’t available they would hold your suitcase for you until it was time to check in. Breakfast is also a plus! ",8,Stephanie,2025-06-13
"El calificativo mas decente que puedo decir del hotel es: son muy abusivos. Me explico. Las cantidades son en peso mexicano, los horarios son de New York. El 20 de mayo a las 16:43:36 intentan hacer un cargo a la tarjeta con la que hice la reserva por 58,762.56, el Banco la rechaza como movimiento irregular. El checkinn fisico se hizo a las 01:30 del 21 de mayo, no habia sistema y solo nos entregaron la s habitaciones. El 21 de mayo, a las 08:59:07, a las 08:59:41 y a las 07:00:39 intentan hacer cargos po 67,687.46 cada uno, a la misma tarjeta, el Banco rechaza los tres. El 21 de mayo a las 10:02:08 intentan hacer un cargo por 8,207.95 a la misma tarjeta, este si lo acepta el Banco. El 21 de mayo a las 10:05 nos apersonamos en el mostrador de recepcion, en donde ya pude hacer tres pagos parciales con otras tarjetas. Pero ahi mismo, me empezaron a rechazar mas pagos, seis en total, con las mismas tarjetas con las que recien habia pagado, el Banco tambien los rechazo. Ademas, por cada intento fallido, el hotel me hizo un cargo por un dolar y esos si los acepto el Banco. Al final tuve que pagar el saldo a mi cargo en efectivo. Fue muy molesta toda esta situacion, iniciando mi estancia me quedo casi sin efectivo, y con el riesgo de que el Banco me bloqueara las tarjetas. Tuve que hacer varias llamadas al Banco para aclarar toda la situacion y asi evitar que me bloquearan las tarjetas.",2,daniel,2025-06-13

"El hotel está ubicado en una zona muy conveniente para conocer Manhattan. Está cerca del subte y de Times Square, lo cual hace que la zona sea obviamente ruidosa y concurrida. El desayuno es muy completo y variado, con cambios en el menú casi todos los días. La habitación es tamaño promedio y cuenta con cocina electrica, heladera grande, cafetera y microondas muy útil para la hora de las comidas.
Tuvimos la mala suerte que uno de los ascensores estaba roto, por lo cual el tráfico en las horas concurridas fueron casi siempre un problema. Más allá de eso, el personal a cargo de agilizar el transporte de pasajeros por el ascensor fue siempre muy servicial, simpático, agradable y atento.
La limpieza del hotel en sus zonas comunes era muy buena, sin embargo dentro de la habitación encontramos basura debajo de la cama y una bolsa con pertenencias de huéspedes anteriores dentro de los muebles de la cocina. 
El staff en general fue siempre muy amable, sobre todo las personas encargadas de limpieza, el desayuno y los ascensores. La mayoría de ellos eran bilingües o incluso políglotas, lo que facilitaba mucho la resolución de cualquier pedido que tuvieramos. El staff de front desk por lo general no era tan amable (a excepción de una chica asiática que fue excelente y super simpática, y lamento mucho no recordar su nombre). Muy pocos en front desk hablaban otro idioma que no fuera inglés, en nuestro caso no fue un problema pero deja mucho que desear dentro de un lugar tan cosmopolita.",8,Josefina,2025-06-09

"Our stay was good. Our interaction with Julie at front desk was helpful and friendly. Our problem was too hot of water for bathing. Was fixed once and then when it happened again they moved us to another room. Elevator situation wasn't very nice and it sounds like an in going situation. That being said, I received an email the night before check-in about the elevator as if it had just happened apologizing for the inconvenience. At check in I was offered too to have a refund. At the zero hour and have booked early enough to get a better rate, where could I have gone on a Saturday night to stay at the price point? Had I known earlier as this is an ongoing problem, I may have chosen somewhere else. That being said, aside from the elevator and hot water, I liked this hotel for location, staff, and very well stocked breakfast and cleanliness.

"We really like this hotel, but 1 out of 3 elevators being out of service for at least 6 mos (since our first stay in early December) is unacceptable. Clients often waited while an elevator passed them by three times (too full!) before being able to get on. Fearing that we would never get on with our luggage, we got up super early our last morning and left our luggage at the front desk until later when we actually checked out. One time was understandable, but the second tome was a deal breaker.  We will not stay here again unless they have sufficient working elevators.",8,Michaelene,2025-06-02

"Upon arrival, I was asked for my card to pay the security deposit. Instead, I was charged another $1300 for my stay which is already paid for via Expedia. Nothing to make up for the HUGE mistake of double charging me, just a “sorry, you’ll get the money back after you check out”. The elevator being down wasn’t a huge issue since they had given prior notice before confirming the stay, but it is quite annoying when you finally get on an elevator, make it up with the luggage only for the room key not to work. The check in process took almost double to triple the time of a normal check in process. The room itself was fine, no huge complaints as I was just there for work and was out most of the days. No offer of water so I had to buy a gallon jug of water from CVS. Strangely enough, the morning of check out, they had a 3-tier cart out full of water bottles by the front desk. The breakfast buffet is fine and has good options. The staff is nice, but it is certainly unpleasant having to be double charged $1300 and only being told “sorry” with a slight shrug.",2,Candice,2025-05-27

The staff was cool and accommodating but the hotel room just average. I did like that there was a kitchenette, fridge and freezer which allowed us to cook and store food properly while we were out but the cleanliness left a lot to be desired. The room that we initially stayed in had a clogged sink and some strange shower spots but the staff were able to help us out by upgrading our stay. The new room was bigger but still had a dust problem, walking without socks or towels on the ground was impossible. I probably would not recommend staying here unless I was on a budget or needed something ASAP. Also, for some odd reason, the elevator would not stop at our floor on 37.

"Where to start.  Orbitz add says that the room is 300 sq. ft, it would be if there wasn't a 150 sq. ft elevator shaft in the room.  The room is very small.  I look at the square footage of a room to avoid this type of thing.  Definitely seems to be a dishonest representation of the actual room.
The elevators in the hotel are in a very poor state.  One doesn't work and the other 2 are not in good shape. Very long lines waiting for the elevator, up and down.  We had to walk both up and down the stairs to get to the 12th floor most days.
The rooms are very basic.  Do not look under the beds if you don't want to be grossed out.",2,Michael,2025-05-13

Great for location free breakfast refrigerator/microwave/coffee maker stove top in room.the major frustration/ drawback everyone complaons about  the elevators 1 of three small elevators out of commission during my 6 days. Would oress call button andcsee elrvator pass your floor 3x plus coz too full so learned the the thrick of pressung both buttons just to  get on a moving elevator to be able to go down tonfirst floor. Esp when trying to make it to theater on time .hope all elevators working soon (although have learned from.past years in this same hotel before current  management) to request 2nd or third floor  so can walk up/down but unable to get  it this trip,8,denise,2025-05-12

"Near 8th Ave was good for theatre.
Elevators wouldn't stop on certain floors.. Needed to get taxi to station. No communal loo working in basement. Told to go to 4th floor room and wait for someone to finish using it.. No one was there so we couldn't get in. Lifts didn't stop, had to walk. Fiasco. Ed helped straight away.. He was more sensible. ",8,Karen,2025-05-12

"We stayed on the 30th floor. The elevators were a nightmare. Out of 3 only 1 would work and go to your floor. They were advertising rooms with a city view on the 30-40th floors and selling them for more than $300 per night without prior telling you that the elevators were broken (no info about this on the booking site), i got an email about it only on the day of my check-in. You would have to wait for that single working elevator for 15 minutes at least each time going up and down. Hard to adjust the tap water temperature, its only boiling hot on both taps. You have to run the water for at least 10 min to try to regulate it. The hotel itself is pretty old. Everything needs a major renovation. No working bathrooms in the lobby/ close to the dining hall. Cleaning service is terrible, they only picked up the trash, leaving the rest out. No ""make my room"" sign available at least to ask them to clean your room. Power sockets out of order in the room, the room telephone not working properly. The hotel looks way worse than the pics on the booking site. We had a double room,  the room was tiny. 
Plus: the location is great, the hotel is  within 5min walk to the Time square,etc.
The beds were wide enough for 2 and comfy. Our room had a fridge,  pack and play per request, microwave, coffee/tea supplies, paper towel, lots of towels in the bathroom, ironing, tv, clock.
The view was nice from our window,  however lots of light from the ads screens,  city lights. Blinds. Breafast was good.",4,Dinara,2025-05-05

Es gab auch täglich kostenlose Wasserflaschen. Die Dusche war auch richtig gut, es war tatsächlich eine richtige Dusche und echt gutem Wasserdruck. Das Hotel ist auch super zentral gelegen. Die einzigen beiden Kritikpunkte sind einmal einer von drei ausgefallenen Aufzüge was zu massiven Wartezeiten geführt hat.

"The hotel room had plenty for us. A full size fridge freezer and a dishwasher as well as a king size bed were all packed in. It was tight for space around the bed resulting in some bruised shins. 

The room was comfortable. It was clean but not thoroughly clean. The staff were fantastic. The location was perfect. The breakfast was awful. Avoid the hot food, just tasteless. Also watch out for the many vultures who take all the bread, ham, cheese, cakes and fruit for their lunch later leaving you with barely anything to choose if you go to breakfast past 9am. 

Also for an eco hotel, the lack of recycling done at breakfast is sad along with chuck away paper cups, plate and plastic knives and forks. We would not stay here again purely for the awful experience that is breakfast. 

I did receive an email letting me know before I arrived that 1 lift was out of use. This caused so many queues and the elevator rides were uncomfortable as you are packed in like a tin of sardines with strangers. I know it couldn’t be avoided and I was pre warned but it was a pain.",6,Sally,2025-05-02
We arrived at 6:45 check-in 3/4 - the room was just ready now but we have a 2 double bed room and that this was an upgrade??? Not when you are a couple and both people are tall! Then elevators took forever because one being worked on. Then took a shower and the rod came apart and water was shooting up everywhere. Needless to say tough entry. The hotel was nice enough and the manager was friendly and helpful but they had a ton of people there and either needed more staff or something! ,4,Camilla,2025-05-02

"A big plus point is the breakfast, with a wide range of options, including healthier options such as fruit and yogurt. The downside was that the elevators took up to 20 minutes to get into. The room is well equipped and clean, the bathroom is a very good feature of the room, only the fridge is very close to the bed and both it and the ac make noise, and at night this is not very pleasant.

Wonderful Irish pub next door, a Pret around the corner, and plenty of other options a short walk away. 
Room was small but clean and everything worked fine. One of the 2 elevators was out but we lucked out with a 2nd floor room.

However a couple days before we check in they send us a message saying that one if the elevators are out of service for reno. When we arrive there was a huge line beacuse one out of three elevators were working. On peak ours we wait more than 20 mins to take the elevator. We were at floor 33, with two toddlers the stairs is not a good option for safety. Whe we arrive to the room we notice the room was not completly clean. We notice front desk and they told us that soembody will go and clean the room. The next day we left the room and when we return the only thing they did was removing the trash from the trash cans, nothing else.  ",6,Jorge H.,2025-04-19
"O hotel tem uma localização excelente, é possível fazer vários pontos turísticos a pé (por exemplo times square, edge, the vessel, empire state, entre outros). O quarto tem um tamanho bom para duas pessoas, possui uma mini cozinha. O café da manhã incluso atende bem.
O hotel seria excelente se não fosse por dois pontos: sao apenas 3 elevadores, sendo que atualmente 2 estão em funcionamento, o que é completamente desproporcional para um hotel com 40 andares, todas as vezes descemos pelas escadas e algumas optamos subir também pelas escadas devido a demora do elevador, isto precisa ser melhorado com a máxima urgência (a dica de quarto é solicitar quarto em andares mais baixos o que ajuda nesta situação). Outro ponto negativo é que a agua do chuveiro nao é quente o suficiente, apenas morna, mas para temperaturas frias de abril poderia ser mais aquecida a agua.

Tirando o elevador e a agua do chuveiro não ser tão quente, de resto o hotel é perfeito e mesmo com estes pontos negativos eu voltaria a me hospedar nele se continuar com preço atrativo.",8,Rodrigo,2025-04-19

One elevator was out but others also had issues with stopping on our floor so on at least three occasions I had to walk down 16 flights of stairs. The location is great, the rate was good in comparison and the beds are very comfortable. The room size was also good in comparison to other local hotels. The hotel also offered breakfast and a snack, which isn't common for area hotels. ",6,Caroline,2025-04-17
"Very disappointing stay at this Marriott Property. The location is good and the room was large. But that is where the positives ended. The service at the front desk was lacking. The room was not in good condition - paint chipped, paint drippings on bathroom walls, furniture banged up and in poor condition. One of the elevators was out of service with no signs they were even attempting to repair it. It took us almost 20 minutes one morning to get off our 15th floor to the lobby. We tried to call the front desk to ask when we could expect an elevator, the house phones were also out of order. And coming back at night was no easier. One evening we counted upwards of 75 people waiting to get an elevator back to their rooms. When we brought this to the attention of the desk, we were told that when we checked in we were given the option to cancel our rooms free of charge and stay elsewhere. First off, this did not happen. And secondly where would we have gone with no reservations at 11 pm at night when we arrived. Definitely would not stay here again.",4,Angela,2025-04-17

"Nous avons passé globalement un bon séjour dans cet hôtel.
Nous avons simplement rencontrer des problèmes importants au niveau des ascenseurs 
En effet, 2 ascenseurs sur trois fonctionnaient. Il arrivait parfois d’attendre plus de 10 min avant de pouvoir descendre.
Il était capable de passer deux fois devant notre étage, sans s’arrêter et parfois il s’arrêtait à un étage où personne ne l’avait appeler. Un vrai irritant ! 
Après 1 semaine sur place, toujours pas réparé.

Le petit déjeuner était très complet et différent tous les jours. Seul souci, la place…. Beaucoup trop petit pour le monde présent dans l’hôtel.

O hotel conta com 3 elevadores e 1 deles estava em manutenção. Por vezes ficamos mais de 30 minutos esperando e quase perdemos o café da manhã. Inclusive, ao chegar no final do café da manhã pela demora do elevador, praticamente ficamos sem, pois vários hóspedes levavam comida para os quartos. 
O hotel no geral é bom, mas tem que ter paciência com a grande quantidade de pessoas. ",8,Verified traveler,2025-03-20

"Zunächst das Positive: Die Unterkunft liegt nicht weit vom Times Square entfernt, somit ist die Lage ziemlich gut. Auch das Personal ist sehr entgegenkommend und bemüht. Das Frühstück war ganz gut. 
Jetzt zum Negativen: Allerdings ist der Zustand des Hotels, speziell unser Zimmer, sehr veraltet. Die Einrichtung hatte schon längst seine besten Tage hinter sich. Z.B. war die Stange des Kleiderschranks kaputt und nicht nutzbar, der Geschirrspüler ließ sich überhaupt nicht einschalten, die Matratze war schon wirklich sehr durchgelegen, einige der versprochenen Küchenutensilien fehlten (der Kochtopf z.B., somit war das Kochfeld auch nicht nutzbar). Auf den Fahrstuhl konnte man auch teilweise sehr lange warten.
Fazit: Auch wenn die Lage wirklich ziemlich gut ist, würde ich das Hotel nicht noch einmal buchen. Es gibt sicherlich in unmittelbarer Nähe bessere Hotels.",6,Irina,2025-03-14

Staff was very friendly but other than that not worth the price. Property was clean but one elevator witch made wait times extreme. Was not made aware of this until prepayment was made. Water in shower only Luke warm at best. Breakfast area very crowded and not much better than other hotels. ,6,DAVID,2025-03-06
We stayed for 5 nights. Nobody is working on its ongoing elevator issue which delays the travel plans by 10-15 min every time. The vegetarian option in breakfast are nil and once they gave me stale lentil patties which was so hard to chew that I had to trash it. The room size was so tiny to accommodate 2 adults. The light and power switch was not in working condition and the bathroom tiles were damaged and had cracks. Overall I would only give plus point for its location otherwise I would opt for other hotels in this cost. ,6,Bharti,2025-03-06

Bathroom was a little outdated as well, but everything was clean and I felt like I had quite a bit of room. Overall a great experience and I’d stay here again!",8,Camille,2025-02-25

40 floors - two elevators- (they started replacing elevators one at a time at the end of 2024) - free breakfast on the ground floor-  a bad combination of circumstances.

positivos: ótimo café da manhã, boa variedade de comidas. recebem encomendas sem cobrança extra. tivemos um problema com a fechadura do quarto e foram super rápidos ao nos transferirem pra outro sem nenhuma cobrança de custos também. equipe atenciosa, principalmente a moça da recepção que nos ajudava sempre. disponibilizam águas todos os dias de manhã para os hospedes levarem. tem um happy hour de segunda a quinta com queijos e cervejas.


negativos: como vários hoteis na região, ele tem apenas dois elevadores e 40 andares, é muito difícil usar. como eu já fui sabendo disso, pedi pra ficar em um andar baixo e subi e desci todos os dias de escadas. o funcionário que carrega as malas poderia ser um pouco mais amigável, foi a única pessoa da equipe que me desapontou.",10,André,2025-02-16

Le petit déjeune est correct sans grande folie. Apéro et gouter gratuit l’après midi!!! La chambre est parfaite avec superbe vue si vous êtes en haut.

En revanche le point vraiment négatif est l’ascenseur, nous nous avons une panne sur un donc 2 ascenseurs pour toit l’immeuble…. Il est vrai comme d’autres commentaires que ce point est vraiment gênant en période d’affluence et certaines heures. Vous pouvez patienter jusqu’à 20 minutes avant qu’î s’arrête car le personnel bloque les accès pour faire monter les personnes après le petit déjeuner par exemples. Gros point noir !!!

Voici le recap de mon avis personnel mais dans l’ensemble il est très bien pour un prix vraiment intéressant à deux pas de times square.

Purtroppo quest'anno causa cancellazione del volo,  e avvertendo la struttura con largo anticipo, non mi è stata rimborsata o fatta recuperare la prima notte di soggiorno sostenendo che la prenotazione era da parte di terzi (Expedia) già prepagata....

Tivemos que descer de escada do 27 andar em um dia , porque o elevador só passava lotado em nosso andar. O café da manhã é bom , mas o espaço é pequeno para a quantidade de hóspedes. O hotel tem que resolver urgente esses problemas, talvez agendar o café da manhã para tentar diminuir o fluxo de pessoas no mesmo horário.

This time, the decoration of the wall of my room was not as attractive as what I saw before. I recall I commented on their food last time (I could not eat spice). This time, the foods were right for me, with lots of choices, I was quite happy that my health need for things like plain oatmeal, egg without spices, watermelon, cucumber and yogurt were satisfied (they got lots of other foods too).

"One elevator was under maintenance so there was huge queue for elevator, sometimes even for 15-20 mins to get into elevator in peak time. They said, it could take months to repair.

phone room was disabled due to some reasons.
The auto controll in AC/heater did not work, sometimes it gets too hot or too cold, it can not control the room temparature, it just runs indefinitely.
Bedsheet, comforter, pillow cover was on cheaper side, not comfortable for us atleast.

Breakfast was ok, room was ok.
one guy at front desk was little rude, another one was nice. Bellboy was very reluctant! Dude, do your job, get your tips and dont forget to smile, it does not cost to smile.
Location is good.",4,Verified traveler,2025-01-24
"Loved the hotel. Staff were brilliant , BUT we knew 1 lift was out of action but when the 2nd lift broke down and your trying to get from floor 39 with 1 lift working and have to wait over 45 minutes to be able to get in 1 and you have a taxi waiting outside, its not funny.

"We stayed at this Hotel for 5 nights, it is very close to Times Square and the Subway. The room was clean and comfortable, with the advantage of having a kitchenette with hobs and dishwasher. We enjoyed the free breakfast each morning and happy hour during the week which included complementary Beer & Wine. The only down side was that one of the elevators was out of action for maintenance, which meant that there was a long wait to get in the lift at busy periods. This didn't really impact us that much as we worked around the busy periods.      ",8,Brett,2025-01-21

The hotel only had three elevators for 49 floors and two operated sporadically. At times there was only one elevator running for the whole hotel. ,6,Rhonda,2025-01-19
"The hotel was relatively clean, in light of its convenient location near Times Square. Staff was friendly but due to understaffing, waittimes in line for anything requiring front desk service were inordinately long. Finally, due to ongoing elevator modernization project, only one of three (quite small) elevators was functioning, resulting in crowds in the small lobby and long wait times on your floor to go down to lobby at peak check in and check out times. In order to check out, I walked down from the 20th floor with my carry-on suitcase bc elevator would not come and when it did it was always full of people. I hope they solve this issue soon.

"Não recomendo. O hotel tem uma localização ótima, em um primeiro momento ter café da manhã e o happy hour até parecem bons pontos que te levam a considerar relevar as falhas que todos dizem que o hotel tem em relação aos elevadores, eu por experiência agora digo: não compensa! Pelo mesmo valor acho que se encontram opções melhores que um hotel de 40 andares que por vezes só tem um elevador em operação. A velha história de que estão sendo reformados creio que é mentira e nem elevador de serviço o hotel tem, então por vezes um dos elevadores é vetado o uso por hóspedes para ser usado pela equipe do hotel, nos deixando com apenas 1 elevador disponível para TODOS os hóspedes de 40 andares. E por falar na equipe, a grande maioria não é amigável nem cordial, são secos e não se esforçam para ajudar em nenhum momento. Eu certamente não voltaria lá e não indicaria para ninguém, os pontos negativos para nós superam e muito os positivos. ",4,Caroline,2025-01-16

The location is fabulous. 
The breakfast each morning had a great variety, definitely something for everyone. 
Every evening between 5 & 7 they served COMPLINENTARY beers, wines soft drinks, bread, olives cheeses and cookies, it was soooo good. 
Prior to our stay, we had read reviews where people complained about the elevators. Yes, there were only 2 out of the 3 elevators working, but in the 6 nights we stayed there, not once did we have to wait more than a minute or 2 at most. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. ",10,Mavis,2025-01-14

"The stay was pleasant and service pretty good. However the elevators barely worked (had to climb down 40 flights of stairs at one point), the rooftop was closed the entire stay, and the phones to call the desk were down. 
The beds were decently comfortable however I have stayed in more comfy beds. Definitely wear and tear spotted around the room but pleasant stay regardless even with the elevators and phones. I did make the trek down to the desk at one point to ask a question and was received with a hand in my face telling me to wait but other than that time the service was excellent.

My biggest complaint with this hotel are the elevators. They will have u standing there for 20 mins and even when one does come it’s full. My other complaint was our new hand towels had make up on it and our bed sheets had dried blood on them. Also there’s a weird smell in the bathroom from the pipes. Overall staff were friendly and co-operative.  ,6,Georgia,2025-01-07
This was the WORST hotel experience ever.  They have one elevator serving 40 floors. Occasionally the second elevator was working.  But mostly not.  I spent a large part of my vacation waiting for the elevator. It was always full and often took more than 30 minutes to use it.  I was late for a Broadway show. I had an uber cancel two times and it cost me $5 each time.  They should not sell reservations if they don’t have the ability to deliver a normal service. It was a miserable experience ,2,Larry,2025-01-06

"Do yourself a favour and do not stay at this hotel. It’s quite a far walk to times square and the area is shady. However, the very worst part is the elevators. I’ve read reviews now that I’ve been there in regards to the elevators. They usually only have one or two working for this type of property of the lineups to use the elevator are insane. And the weight is at least up to 30 minutes. It was horrible. And when I asked the front desk, if they were repairing them, they said it could take up to a few months??? As they were already down for a few months. The worst part is it cost us so much money to stay at this hotel what we would’ve been paying for a five star hotel. I guess it was the time of year. Not to mention Expedia did not help us at all when we called in regards to our room situation. I would never ever book with Expedia again horrible customer service. Always book with Hotels.com.

The wait time could be easily up to 30-40 mins if you were using their peak time such as breakfast time and check ins. 
And also the dining area/lobby are so small for the guests.

However, during busier times they did have a serviceman overriding the stops to expedite the wait time a little bit. Location is great! This hotel is only a 3 minute walk from Port Authority where we took the subway to a Q70 bus stop which is free to LaGuardia Airport. So for $2.90 we were able to get from the airport to the hotel in 30 minutes, which you can’t beat!

"Die Lage des Hotels war super. Man konnte vieles zu Fuß erreichen bzw. Subway war direkt um die Ecke. Die Zimmer hatten eine angenehme Größe und waren mit einer kleinen Küche ausgestattet. 
Ein absoluter Minuspunkt ist der Aufzug. Von 3 funktionieren nur 2 und selbst da musste man teilweise bis 25 Minuten warten. Das angebotene Frühstück ließ auch zu Wünschen übrig. Alles aus Pappe/ Plastik und wenig abwechslungsreich.  Ansonsten gab es immer kostenlos Wasser, Tee und Kaffee. Aufgrund der Lage würde ich es trotzdem noch einmal buchen. ",6,Kerstin Daniela,2024-12-20
"Right in the heart of Times Square.  Breakfast was adequate to get us going in the morning.  Issue was that we needed foam instead of feather pillows, and it took 5 requests over two days to get them.

Big problem with the room was the heater.  It was freezing cold outside, BUT the heater, no matter what temperature you set was either stifling hot or off.  We had to keep cycling it on and off, which wasn't convenient for a good night's sleep.

NOOOO water pressure in the shower. 

Also, one of the elevators was broken so the wait was long, but they alerted us to this before we chose a room, so they offered us second floor, which we took, and we ended up just using stairs, once we used it once to get our suitcases upstairs. 

If you are on a budget, and want to stay IN Times Square, we would recommend, but know this is not luxury.",8,Bobra,2024-12-18

"Fine hotel, but the elevator situation added a stress that wasn't needed. ",8,Elizabeth,2024-12-01
The hotel has an amazing location and super friendly staff. They allowed us to check in early as well. They offer a free breakfast as well. Coffee is available all day and free water bottles.  My only complaint would be the elevators. They have three but only two working and in the late afternoon/evening they use one for movement of garbages and supplies which I understand needs to be done but it still is a huge inconvenience and long waits.  Overall we had good sleeps on comfy beds and a little kitchenette and a great view!!!! ,6,Susan L,2024-12-01

"Soggiorno sopra le mie iniziali aspettative. Servizio di pulizia camere giornaliero compreso (sempre meno frequente a New York) ottima e varia colazione con scelta di dolce e salato (diversa tutti i giorni) e ""merenda"" pomeridiana (alla quale non ho avuto modo di partecipare) bottigliette d'acqua a disposizione giornalmente. Camera con piccola cucina molto ben equipaggiata. Dimensioni della camera superiori alla media di New York (per questa tariffa). L'unica nota negativa è l'ascensore. Insufficiente per la richiesta degli ospiti. Lunghissime attese che in alcuni casi mi hanno costretta a prendere le scale antincendio per non arrivare tardi a tour precedentemente prenotati.

"The property was mostly fine. The kitchenettes were a huge plus. The neighborhood is a little iffy as there are a ton of homeless on 39th. Proximity to time square and subway was good. What was disqualifying was that one of the three elevators was out of service for our entire stay. As a result we ended up mostly having to take the stairs up and down from our room as the wait for elevators could take upwards of 20 mins during busy times like breakfast or dinner. We ended up having to carry our luggage and two small children down seven flights of stairs to make sure we didn’t miss our flight. If the elevators were all working I could recommend but as long as they are under renovation, I would steer clear.",6,Richard,2024-11-28
"Das Element Hotel habe ich bereits dieses Jahr das zweite mal gebucht. Es liegt super zentral zu allen Attraktionen und Zielen die NY zu bieten hat. Die Subway ist gleich um die Ecke. Das Zimmer war immer sauber und großzügig ausgestattet. Darüber hinaus hatte man in der 39. Etage einen super Ausblick über die Stadt. Das Frühstück war super für den Start in den Tag und das Service Team sehr aufmerksam. 
Danke an das Element Team, welches stets freundlich und hilfsbereit war. Ich freue mich schon auf den nächsten Besuch in 2025.

Many other better hotels nearby don’t choose this hotel.Terribly noisy!!! house keepers shut every door like this is no other person there!!!! waiting 10-20 minutes For the elevator.Actually the elevator doesn’t work so we uses stairs because that waiting time was too much!!!No one comes to peak up luggage at the reception!!!

The coffee maker was so dirty . The elevator was broken wait forever. The stuffs is not nice.,4,Nichapha,2024-11-26
The rooms are a really good size - and the kitchen has everything you would need. The heavy doors block out noise of other guests coming and going in the lobby. The breakfast is excellent - hot and cold options - plenty of variety and plenty of it. Lots of people struggle waiting for lifts at peak times that they operate manually to help congestion - if this is a major factor for you - just ask for a room on a lower floor. We stayed on the 4th floor so we could use the stairs. The staff are lovely. Great location.,10,Deborah Kay,2024-11-26

"Had a great stay. Free breakfast was an amazing bonus. Only issue was while using the shower the water wasn’t draining quickly enough and was left behind when the next person showered. Water also made it out of the shower and into the floor, no matter how we tried to prevent that from happening. We had no luck with it. ",8,Melissa,2024-11-24
"Staying here was an unpleasant experience.

CONDITION:
1. The elevators are undergoing maintenance, waiting time is extremely long. They said it would take 2+ more months.
2. The phone in one room was broken, in another room entirely missing - no way to contact reception.
3. The water in the bathroom sink did not drain properly.
4. The shower did not have hot water in the early morning.

SERVICES:
5. Once inside the room, someone came in without notice, entered the bathroom, and left. Shortly after he came again, and said that he is doing maintenance. To my question answered that he is doingmaintenance. ""did not know someone checked in"". 
6. They do not allow to leave luggage after check-out in the hotel until late night. I planned to pick mine around midnight, and instead was forced to carry it with around with me.",4,Verified traveler,2024-11-24

"The rooms and staff are great!

The Breakfast and Happy Hour options have diminished since I started going to this Hotel.

The Elevator situation  is the worst I experienced thus far. The Elevators are being worked on to improve them, but this means one is entirely out of commission and staff are manually controlled the other two. For a 40 story Hotel this seems a bit crazy. 

Happy to stay there again but once the Elevators are fixed.",6,Jason Steven,2024-11-21

"We stayed at Element because it was a hotel that offered a room that accommodated 4 people, and walking distance to Times Square.  The area around the hotel is unsafe, filled with homeless people, trash everywhere, and it smelled of human waste.  We went in August and the heat made that stench worse.  The workers were extremely slow in checking people in and out.  The elevators took extremely long. Sometimes the elevator would be filled, and you needed to wait for another one.  The room was dirty.  The shower would not drain, and the floor was slanted away from the drain so it just collected and overflowed onto the floor. There was mold along the perimeter of the shower and in the bathroom, and smelled like mold. Google the street area,.. and you will find that it is a high crime area.  When we got home, this area was on the news regarding the trash and crime. I would never stay here again.   ",2,timothy,2024-11-15

"We were given a room at floor11. 

* The sink in the bathroom would not work; the water in it could not flow away. We asked the clerk to change our room; but we were told that no room was available. They got somebody to come into our room to check it out and fix, that’s around 12:30 AM; then we were told to remove the stopper in the sink to use it. However, we noticed that later the sink was also leaking, and that toilet was leaking too. 

* The shower place is very small and dirty; the hotel put a dirty folded table in the shower place and it couldn’t be removed away. The sprinkler device is very poor and simple. You have to squat to take a shower or use one hand to hold the sprinkler. 

* Emergency passageway has obstacles. Just out of the room, a large shelf had been placed in the passageway since we arrived. Once there was need for leaving for emergency, customers would be in danger and big trouble. 

Room is also dirty. This condition is not acceptable for providing to any customer, and it took almost $500 one night. I will not choose this hotel anymore. ",4,Verified traveler,2024-10-27

"There are not enough elevators for the number of floors and people that the hotel accommodates. In addition, the technology of the elevators is inadequate (they are very slow and take a long time to stop at each floor). They are overloaded with people and there is no ventilation.
It takes a LOT of time and requires too much patience to go up or down from each floor, and this generates a lot of discomfort among the guests.
They are not in line with the price of the hotel, nor with the rest of the facilities, which are good. I felt cheated.",6,Silvina,2024-10-23

Lots of negative reviews about the elevators being slow. Those are true.

1. Aircon right next to the bed, like sleeping next to an engine in the evening. (Room with 2 beds)
2. Bathroom glass partition cannot shield against water spill. After shower, floor outside the shower is all wet and damp. Very unpleasant.( The hotel doesnt understand the shower place is a sanctuary for the guest?)
3. Breakfast with a few options. All utensils are plastic and disposables. Always very crowded, like University cafeteria, nothing like USD 382/night. Many had to carry the foof to their rooms. Suggest dont buy the breakfast there, better eat outside.

La sala forse è un po' piccola rispetto al numero dei clienti, per cui può essere che, se si é più di due, non si riesca a sedersi tutti assieme. Personale gentile e molto disponibile. Prezzi onesti e trasparenti. ",8,Laura,2024-09-04

La situación la resolvieron muy bien y supieron ver el error. Es de agradecer el desayuno y la merienda por la tarde. El servicio de habitaciones ha sido bueno y el único gran problema es el ascensor, son sólo 3 y en horas punta se colapsa.

During check in and check out of this hotel, staff were rude and unkind, the sinks were constantly blocked in room 1001, there were huge cockroaches in the room and the bed had a dip in it that felt as if we were sleeping in a hammock.

Kichenette and large fridge are perfect for saving some money on food. This really makes a difference.

"This was my husbands first trip to the city so I wanted to make sure we were close and convenient to big locations or the subway to make it more enjoyable- and this was spot on! We could easily walk to the subway and Times Square. We were also close to shopping and food. The rooms were clean and plenty of room for the two of us considering we were only in there to sleep. The bathroom was small but worked for us. The towel handle was already falling off when we got there, but we just didn’t mess with it. The staff was incredibly nice. They held our bags the day we got there and the day we left since our flight in was early and our flight out was later- so we got to explore the city more! All around great things at a very great price. We will definitely be back here. ",10,Haley,2024-07-25

"Everything was amazing. The bed was so comfortable, How convenient the hotel is from the sites and having multiple trains around that can get you everywhere. I initially reserved 3 rooms. When we arrived. Two of the three reserved rooms got to check in while the attendant told me that my room ai would have to come back to check in when it was available. All three rooms were also separated on all different floors. Floor 10,11,12, which was a bit inconvenient because one room had a small child and one room had an elderly and it would’ve been better to accommodate the rest of my family if we have rooms closer to each other. I also notice the elevator taking 20-30 minutes to used at some points during the day. I know I could’ve used the stairs but my family had a small child and an elderly. It would be too full or it would pass the floor multiple times when we need the elevator. I also booked my hotel many weeks before. I also notice that the room that we checked in since the hotel host told us to come back to check in was smaller than the rest of the rooms and wasn’t properly set up because we were missing some towels and the bed was off the bed frame.  the Room tv welcome screen didn’t say my name but Majid instead.

"The staff is rude and doesn't care about inquiries regarding error in the room.
When we approached the staff, they were rude and completely indifferent and just said, we'll look into it. We had booked a room with a kitchen. Both the stove and toaster were not working when we arrived. We complained about this on day 1, twice on day 2 and on day 3 we got hold of the manager who promised that it would now be fixed. We got a new toaster, but the stove was broken and maintenance had unplugged it before we arrived. (this should have been stated on arrival) We were offered a new room on the 3rd day, but we were on our way to a booking and had to check out the next day, so we declined this. After all, it hadn't worked for most of our stay anyway. The agreement then became another compensation in terms of points. We never got these. Contacted both the hotel and the manager several times but never got a reply. They don't care about their customers and the manager is full of ……
Really the worst service imaginable.

En NINGÚN momento el personal de recepción me dejó meter algún REPORTE o QUEJA, solo me decían que si aparecían me marcaban, en lo personal no volvería a ese hotel por que no dejan meter quejas a su personal para que estén al pendiente de lo que pasa y cubren a su personal de ROBO.

Super bem localizado... vc vai conhecer vários lugares a pé. ",10,Maria L S,2024-06-24

"Element NY Times Square West was spotlessly clean, staff were helpful and friendly, breakfast was a great addition and gave us a good start to the day and housekeeping did a great job.  The lifts were often busy but we didn’t have to wait for more than a few minutes for another one to pass by.  In fact we had lots of lovely conversations/laughs with other guests during our lift trips.  Fantastic place, would definitely recommend.  ",10,Angela,2024-06-23

"Walked in & was welcomed with enthusiasm, check in was quick & easy, I was given some essential information about the hotel & then a leaflet to reinforce this. It all took less than five minutes.
I had asked for a high city view room, I was in 3805 and that’s what I got, I could see the Empire State, One WTC & large parts of NJ.
It’s a good size room, very clean, good bed, good shower, room safe, comfy chair, desk chair. Nice little kitchenette with everything you need for a few days.
Overall the property was good, clean & well maintained with all the staff I met very courteous, keen to help & efficient.
I had breakfast there a couple of times, hot buffet, cereals etc. it was good but got busy & frankly was unpleasant when I went at 8am with a number of European visitors who can’t grasp the idea of polite queues.
Lifts could be busy & I waited once or twice for more than five minutes for a lift down, but that’s my experience at any decent size NY hotel.
When I booked, one of the things that caught my attention was the roof top terrace. It suggested a roof top bar area to enjoy evening views over the City & relax with others. It was a bit of a disappointment to find a somewhat cramped area with a couple of tables and half a dozen chairs. There are views but no bar.
The area around the hotel is incredibly busy but felt safe, all the subways are easily accessible from here.
A very good hotel & I would recommend it, definitely would stay here again.",10,simon,2024-06-20

Hotel precisa melhorar os elevadores que ficava parando andar por andar porque as pessoas apertavam tanto para descida como subida pois os 3 elevadores não davam conta dos 40 andares. Café bom mas sempre lotado. Quarto bom com mini cozinha completa mas cama de casal pequena (no nosso caso eram 2 camas e pequenas).

"Het hotel is super centraal gelegen. Maat je hebt geen overlast van het geluid door de heel goede isolatie.
De Airco, daarin tegen, staat vlak naast het bed en maakt hierdoor teveel lawaai om te laten aanstaan 's nachts.
Er is een keuken voorzien om zelf te koken, maar er is maar één stoel voorzien, dus eten met z'n twee lukt niet en eten op het bed of staand is ook niet aangenaam.
Kamer was proper en het personeel super vriendelijk.
Van maandag tot donderdag is er tussen 17:00 en 1800 steeds happy hour waar de klant in de watten gelegd wordt met gratis wijn, bier of andere en versnaperingen.
Soms kan het druk zijn aan de lift en kan je wel even blijven wachten tot je mee kan.

Tem um happy hour com petiscos e algumas bebidas pelas tardes. E no hall do hotel sempre tem um mimo pela tarde. Vimos tardes onde tinham cookies e pipoca, uma opção por dia. Deixamos nossas malas antes do checkin e após o checkout também, o que ajuda bastante.
A localização é muito boa, no quarteirão ao lado de uma estação de metrô. A poucos quarteirões da times e com muitas opções para comer por perto, perímetro bem movimentado.
Foi uma estadia muito boa e agradável.

"We had a lovely trip to NYC. The room was adequate to meet our needs - really loved the little kitchenette! The complimentary breakfast and daily happy hour was lovely and so appreciated! Unfortunately the big issue with this hotel is the elevator situation. During peak hours (morning and evening) you can wait 10-15 minutes to get an elevator to your room. I'm 7 months pregnant and had to take the stairs a few times to get to our room or downstairs, which wasn't exactly my idea of a restful stay. We'll find another place to stay in NYC next time, but we enjoyed our trip this time! ",6,Rebekah,2024-05-23
"I was on a girls trip and stayed at The Element Times Square.  It was absolutely perfect!  The location was unbeatable for getting all over the city, whether we walked to Broadway Shows or to the Subway.  The restaurant right next door had delicious food, and the hotel staff gave us a coupon.  About the hotel staff, they were so friendly and accommodating!  They would tell us which subway lines to take or where to find the best restaurants.  The evening wine, beer and cheese during the week added a very nice touch.  This hotel felt like home when we’d return every night after our adventure filled days in NYC!  I highly recommend you stay here, and I will definitely stay here from now on when I visit one of my favorite Cities in the world!",10,Angela,2024-05-22

Walking underground to the many of the stations. Many attractions are within walking distance. Had some minor issue with room which was addressed promptly. Breakfast was good and plentiful.

Very bad service quality. Literally had to beg to have the room cleaned which happens once in two days. Drug peddling and solicitation happens freely just outside the property. Area cordoned off for most of the stay and it required us to take a long detour because there was a stabbing and police cordoned off the scene. Nothing the hotel could have done but it gives you a picture of the neighborhood. Extremely rude staff - Not sure if this is the standard for NYC as this was my only time staying here but if it is it’s an extremely low bar,4,Girivasan,2024-04-20

"Je suis mitigée, mais il y a pas mal de points positifs. Nous avions une chambre de quatre personnes au 39e étage, et franchement la vue et la grandeur de la chambre était top ma sœur qui avait une chambre de quatre mais 10 étages plus bas avec une chambre beaucoup plus petite et beaucoup moins agréable. En ce qui concerne la literie un peu molle, mais franchement plus que correct les serviettes de toilettes on a dû en réclamer car nous étions quatre et on n’en avait eu que trois mais cela s’est fait sans problème. Le petit déjeuner qui est inclus est plus que convenable, personnellement j’ai apprécié. L’attente aux ascenseurs est normal il y a énormément d’étages et beaucoup de monde. Donc aux heures de pointe il y a un peu d’attente et parfois on se balade un peu dans les étages. Mais franchement j’ai connu pire. Le Rooftop est un petit plus avec une vue  sympa, L’apéro du lundi au jeudi 17h30 18h30 et appréciable. Le petit bémol c’est que la chambre a été faite une seule fois l’avant dernier jour de nos départ pour un séjour de cinq nuits, ça fait peu. On a dû réclamer du papier toilette, car personne n’est n’est venu les quatre premiers jours! Et en ce qui concerne l’emplacement franchement pas très loin de la première bouche du métro, pas très loin des lignes du bus, pas très loin de T Square donc franchement c’était top pas trop bruyant. Après il est vrai qu’on était au 39e étage. Donc pour le reste, je ne sais pas. ",8,Jerome,2024-04-13
Hotel was excellent value in a central location allowing to easily get to the main sites by foot and subway. The only problem is the sheer amount of ‘zombies’ injecting drugs and smoking crack pipes literally outside the hotel front door and the nearby streets. We witnessed several drug deals and incidents of drug taking at all times of the day.

"We have stayed at this hotel many times. Great location for walking in all directions. We like to stay on one of the higher floors to get a city view. This time our room was 3810. I don't recommend a 10 room, as one side of the bed is right up against the het/AC unit which makes it very difficult to access that side of the bed. Also had some difficulty getting hot water for a shower - had to run the water up to 15 minutes to get it warm - not hot. Breakfast was good with lost of options, however the scrambled eggs were terrible.",8,Lawrence,2024-04-07
"I booked a junior suite and when I checked in, they put us in a regular room. I went down to change it and they had no suites available. I had to wait until day 2, which was fine, but no refund or price modification was offered. I was bummed because I booked and paid for the room well in advance and even called that morning to let them know I was checking in late. I guess I should have verified the type of room as well. 

The suite was definitely worth it. Plenty of space, it was clean and quiet. The elevators are slow and busy but it worked out fine. 

Breakfast was decent, happy hour was nice, and DO take advantage of their car service to the airport. It was cheaper than what Uber was charging at the time. Everything was close (times square, subway, theatres, etc) all within a 10 minute walk. 

I would stay again just for the suite. ",8,Veronica,2024-04-06

"Overall, I liked the place except the location was a little bit off meaning felt unsafe and dirty out on the street. 

Each member of the staff was truly exceptional, exhibiting kindness and professionalism throughout our interaction. However, I must express my disappointment with the luggage attendant whose name begins with V. His demeanor was noticeably unfriendly. Also, he casually flicked the card or ticket containing our baggage information onto the table and tersely informed us that everything was in order. While I do not anticipate excessive politeness, his behavior from the outset of our experience at this establishment was undeniably rude.",6,Donghyeok,2024-02-19

Das Zimmer war sehr geräumig und ruhig, wurde kontinuierlich gereinigt, Küche und Schreibtisch vorhanden. (wer es braucht (:  )
Sehr nett war auch das Frühstück, optimal zum Start in den Tag. Das Hotel liegt super zentral und an vielen Subway Linien in der Nähe, von hier aus kann man optimal zu vielen Aktivitäten starten. In der Umgebung findet mal viele typische New Yorker Restaurants, für alle was dabei.

O quarto acima do esperado, cozinha cimpleta, espaçoso, para família foi fantástico.
Conseguimos fazer jantar, porque ja estavamos há 30 dias comendo fora, tem todos os itens para cozinhar, geladeira grande. 
Ah, ainda sem contar o farto café da manha e ainda sempre disponível água saborizada e todos os dias servem por volta das 17h vinho, cerveja, sucos, água,  cafés e tira-gostos.
Parabéns, vocês sao nota mil.",10,Leila,2024-01-12

"En general es buen hotel, muy bien ubicado, pero tiene el GRAN problema de no tener suficientes elevadores, los tiempos de espera para bajar o subir suelen ser un tema, son chicos por lo que no caben muchas personas a la vez. Entonces si tienes suerte de estar en un piso bajo lo recomendable es usar las escaleras de servicio. ",8,Tomas,2024-01-10
"Malgré le fait que c’est en plein centre ville et proche de tout, la nuit il est difficile de dormir si vous avez le sommeil léger.

À part ça, bon séjour, déjeuner très complet.",8,Aline,2024-01-10
Great location close to everything and easy to get lyft rides / cabs.  Really good breakfast options and overall room and hotel was clean.  The shower and water pressure was great! Beds & pillows are a little uncomfortable but not the worst. You can hear the sirens from the streets but we expected that and it wasn’t so bad you can’t sleep,8,Jessica,2024-01-09
"Was not clean at all, breakfast was not well managed at all (the buffet was always empty, and when you could serve yourself the food was still frozen...), was supposed to be pet friendly but our dog was not allowed anywhere but in the room. 
The location of the hotel is great tho but the rest was not worth it at all. 
Will never go back unfortunatly.",2,Manon,2024-01-09

"L’hôtel est très bien , nous avions une chambre avec une superbe vue sur Times square . Y’a le petit déjeuner et des pop corns en libre service ainsi que le goûter le soir. 
Les points négatifs sont que pour le goûter il n’y a pas grand chose par rapport à 2016 quand on y a séjourné , puis dans la rue de l’hôtel c’est très sale , des drogués en groupes , beaucoup de cartons , odeur de pipi.cest bien dommage ",8,Christophe,2024-01-08

"Perfect location! Right in the heart of the city, walking distance to everything! Staff is very attentive and helpful. Rooms are spacious and very clean. Bed is comfortable. Breakfast each morning has great options, as some have said, there’s only a certain number of tables to sit at, but it’s fine considering how many guests are actually in the hotel. It seemed to be busiest about 8:30am and more open without waiting prior to that. If you’re mindful & just eat and get up so another guest can sit, it’s fine. We only waited a few minutes each morning. The free reception on weekdays with wine, beer and munchies is a nice touch! Yea, there are homeless just down the street who are in the same spot everyday. It’s NYC, there’s sadly homeless everywhere. Never once did they bother us, nor did we feel unsafe! We stayed in a 2 room suite this last time. Wonderful! So much space! Element will be our go to spot everytime we visit the city!! ",10,Kimberlee,2024-01-08

"L'hotel è al di sopra delle aspettative per il prezzo pagato a NY nei giorni di capodanno. Alcune pecche che abbiamo segnalato anche all'hotel: aria calda troppo rumorosa e funzionante male e rubinetto della doccia rotto da tempo (c'erano i segni per terra della caduta dello stesso antecedente al soggiorno per cui era cosa nota eppure non è stato sistemato). Nel complesso la zona non è troppo pericolosa ma la sera diventa più pericolosa ma del resto come tutti i dintorni di Times Square. La posizione è ottima, a qualche passo dai maggiori punti di interesse. Ci tornerei sicuramente.",8,Federica,2024-01-08
"An excellent property with very comfortable accommodations. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet offered a very good selection. My only complaint would be the elevators.  We were on the 39th (of 40) floor and our elevator ride often took up to 20 minutes. Sometimes it would reach the floor below us and then head back down. Other times, it would skip our floor. Very very frustrating. But, I repeat, a very good stay at a very good hotel. ",10,Luis,2024-01-08
"Just stayed last week, the hotel was great, room was small, but had everything you need for pleasant stay. 
The breakfast was good, I didn’t like that everyday was egg, but it was good. Coffee was delicious. 
The staff were amazing , and the location is really the best. 
The elevators were a problem as there are only 3, they get packed easily so you have to wait a long time for the lift. 
Definitely If I go back to NYC I would choose this hotel again.

Le personnel est très gentil
Les langues parlées sont l'anglais et l'espagnol. 
Une laverie est au premier sous sol ainsi que la salle de sport
Les chambres sont confortables et très bien équipées avec une cuisine complète. 
Le ménage est fait un jour sur deux ce qui est très correct.
Les chambres avec vue vous donnent une vision de Manhattan magnifique. 
Le seul petit point négatif est le fait de parfois devoir attendre l'ascenseur (au nombre de 3 pourtant) et l'eau chaude qui met un peu de temps à arriver.

We had breakfast incl. and that was very nice. maybe not continental but is was nice tho. fruit, eggs, bagels, muffins. some complain about the elevators and waiting time but we didn't experience that. what an extra is, is the snaak/drinks time form monday to thursday from 5:00pm tot 6:30pm. Don't expact a diner table but the snacks were fine. and also if you like beer and wine. (we don't but they don't serve JD :D ). so i would recommend this hotel. we stayed there for 9 nights.

"Durante mi reciente estancia en este hotel, encontré que el cuarto, en términos generales, era adecuado. Sin embargo, varios aspectos del hotel dejaron mucho que desear. 

En primer lugar, el desayuno ofrecido fue decepcionante. La calidad de la comida no estaba a la altura de lo esperado, lo que resultó en una experiencia insatisfactoria cada mañana. Además, las instalaciones del comedor eran extremadamente pequeñas. La limitada capacidad del espacio hacía que conseguir una mesa fuera una tarea complicada y estresante, especialmente durante las horas pico. Otro punto a mencionar es la insuficiencia de los elevadores. El hotel cuenta con solo tres, lo que claramente no es suficiente para atender las necesidades de todos los huéspedes. Esta situación generaba largas esperas y aglomeraciones innecesarias, lo cual era bastante incómodo. 

En cuanto al servicio en el front desk, fue notablemente indiferente. La actitud del personal daba la impresión de que no estaban contentos trabajando en el hotel. Mostraban falta de interés en proporcionar información o asistencia, y en general se veían molestos, lo que afectaba negativamente la experiencia general de la estancia.

El único aspecto positivo que puedo destacar del hotel es su ubicación privilegiada. Situado a pocas cuadras de Times Square, el acceso a varios puntos de interés y atracciones de la ciudad era bastante conveniente. Esta proximidad es ideal para turistas que buscan explorar el corazón de la ciudad.",6,Jose de Jesus,2023-12-04

"First of all, I know it's not the hotel's fault, but the comments mentioning the homelesses around the hotel are absolutely true. You will see them all around the area, smoking crack and defecating on the sidewalk. The 7 Eleven nearby, that should be super convenient, is basically useless because of the homelesses that took control of the front door and will only allow you to enter if you pay them a ""toll"".

Other than that, the hotel is nice, located near the main area in Midtown, near the subway and many dining options. The breakfast area is small and there are few options of things to eat, but everything is good and fresh. The only downsides are the shower (low pressure) and the elevators that take a loooong time at peak hours. ",8,Vitor,2023-11-13

"Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,
wir hatten bei Ihnen das Hotel Elements in New York gebucht, einmal für August und dann noch einmal für Oktober. Leider hatten wir bei unserer zweiten Reservierung Probleme.
Telefonisch bei der Hotline des Hotels hatte man uns auf unsere Rückfrage nach einem ruhigen Zimmer zugesagt dass wir das Zimmer im 39. Stock (Zimmer Nr 3905 city view) wieder bekommen und das wäre auch bei unserer Buchung so vermerkt.
Gebucht hatten wir bei Expedia ein Zimmer für 3 Übernachtungen ""deluxe king zimmer city view"", erhalten haben wir jedoch ""standard room"" Zimmer Nr. 1207. Das haben wir dann erst gemerkt als wir auf dem Zimmer waren, im übrigen war um 17 Uhr kein anderes Zimmer für uns verfügbar, wir hätten sonst noch eine weitere Stunde warten müssen (obwohl Check In Zeit mit 15 Uhr angegeben ist).
Auf unserer Frage nach einem Refund wegen des Differenzbetrages sagte man uns, wir müssen das alles mit Expedia klären. Überhaupt war das Personal zu uns sehr unfreundlich, sagte uns auch, dass wir ja nur „third party“ Gäste seien weil wir über Expedia und nicht direkt gebucht haben.
Außerdem war in der Dusche der Schlauch zu Kurz und ein Teil abgebrochen und hatte scharfe Kanten.
Aber am meisten geärgert hatte uns, dass wir trotz der Buchung „City View“ mit dem höheren Preis und dem offensichtlich dann erhaltenen ""Standard Innenhof“ bezgl der Preisdifferenz keinerlei Unterstützung erhielten,man sagte uns nur, Expedia könnte dann ja im Hotel anrufen und nachfragen.",6,Markus,2023-11-08

"This hotel is too expensive for what it gives in return, everything is of a quite low standard. One of the nights there was a party outside the building with extremely noisy music until around 1am, I was with my son and nobody could sleep. Unacceptable. We arrived 1h before 3pm, the official check in time, we asked if there was a room available, the lady in reception told me: ""We have, but you need to pay extra 75USD!!"" Crazy, etc, etc.",2,Carlos,2023-11-06
"Element is a great hotel. Unfortunately the block that it is on isn’t great- lot of homelessness and people smoking weed everywhere. However we had a great stay. The room was spacious and comfortable, the bathroom was nice with a large shower and having the kitchen area with a large fridge was a nice touch. Staff were always happy to help and the housekeeping was great. Breakfast could be busy but the food was good. As others have said the elevators can be slow dependent on the you’re using them. If you’re trying to go for breakfast or just to leave the hotel at around 9am you will be waiting for an elevator- the longest we waited was about 15mins so not terrible but we saw a lot of American become very frustrated with this. At other times of day the elevators were fine so we didn’t really have too many issues with it. ",8,Sarah,2023-11-06

"I liked the free breakfast each day and the view from our room. I liked that we had a kitchenette. No ice machine, but you could make ice in the freezer, but no trays.  The front desk can get ice for you from the kitchen.
They had a ""relax"" hour a couple of times at 5:30 pm. No adult beverages, but did get a coupon for a free drink next door.  
The hotel was clean. They will check your bags for you if you get in before check in time or in the morning for an afternoon pick up. The staff was friendly.
The online pics show a lounge area with sofas. That is now part of the breakfast area, which is great. Breakfast included a yogurt bar, breads (with peanut butter, jelly and cream cheese), various pastries, oatmeal packets, 3 chafing dishes that rotated through eggs, omelets, sausage, pancakes, and potatoes. They always had apples and bananas, but would also have pears and oranges.There was always orange juice and cranberry juice.  Coffee and tea available all day.
There are only 3 elevators for 40 floors of 8 rooms each.  It was often quicker to walk down 26 flights of stairs than wait for the elevator during peak breakfast hours.
Great views from the rooftop deck.  
The area right outside the hotel is a 3/10 but so is most of the area around Times Square. The subway is only a block away. Traffic around Times Square mostly at a stand still, so taking public transit was quickest. Hotel right off of 42nd street station.  Penn station within walking distance.

If we wanted clean towels, because the room was not cleaned every day, we had to ask for them. Who? You couldn't call on the phone and every time we tried to talk at the front desk, there were so many people waiting. The breakfast area is just Terrible. Many people and little space. In one corner of the entrance to the Hotel there were people on drugs and a very bad smell. In truth, we will not return to that Hotel and as Subscribers, we are extremely disappointed.

"I stayed there for 2 nights.

I assume this is their tactic, just ignore the guest until they go away (I’ve seen other comments after my stay that mention the same problem). The bed was also awful. So I didn’t have a good experience and I wouldn’t recommend other people to stay here. For 240/night (with tax) I expected at least something decent.",2,Verified traveler,2023-10-28

"We stayed at the Element for a special birthday celebration, our room was a junior suite that has kitchenette and a small living room vibey sofa, desk and tv. Even though I requested a birthday celebration by sending a message to the hotel team when booked the suite, when we arrived it was not done. They said they didn’t get such message even though I showed them the whole conversation about it between me and the hotel team. It was weird, instead the front desk worker gave us a bag with chips and granola bar to compensate for the mistake. Rooms are cleaned every other day, so we didn’t get any cleaning service done through our 2 nights 3 days stay. The elevators are total failure like everyone else say.. one thing I liked was their open buffet breakfast, they have fruit, yogurt, muffin, bagel, cereals, various beverages. It was above average I could say. They also have gym and rooftop in which we enjoyed the limited view. The neighborhood is not safe, there are a lot of drug dealing and smoking going on, it is a spot for homeless people too. ",6,Selin,2023-10-26
"Nous avons eu une très belle chambre au 39ème étages et nous voudrions vous remercier car nous avons passés un excellent séjour. Nous avions une vue magnifique sur l'ESB à gauche et the Edge à droite, La literie était incroyable, nous avons très bien dormis sans entendre le bruit dans la rue. Le petit déjeuné était varié et changé tous les jours. Ménage fait 1 jour sur 2 donc parfait.
Collation en fin de journée appréciable; personnels aimables.
Ascendeurs un peu long le matin mais dans l'ensemble pas un problème car nous allions déjeuné vers 07h00. 
Le seul problème c'est la rue le soir où il y a beaucoup de sans abris, nous n'avons pas eu de soucis mais cela fait un peu peur quand même.
Merci pour ce séjour ",10,ANTONI,2023-10-26

"Great location, a short walk to Times Square and Broadway. Close to the subway to get everywhere else in the city. The rooms were clean and maintained. It was random what each room had, we had two rooms and each room was missing things. One room had no blanket, just a sheet on the bed, and one room had no toiletries. The free breakfast was a battle. There was lots of food but not enough tables so we ended up standing and eating most of the time. Also, with only 3 elevators and 40 floors we ended up having to use the stairs in the morning. Luckily we were only on the 5th floor. Despite these drawbacks I would return because it is a perfect location. ",8,Patricia,2023-10-24
"The lift was at times a nightmare. We were on the 40th floor and it was a long way up and down the stairs.
Breakfast was fine. Lots of choice and great to grab a quick snap and head out.
Lots of strange people around Port Authority  and Times Square but I think that’s just New York!
Our room was great. Fantastic views. We discovered there’s a roof terrace the floor above which was empty most of the time. 
Brilliantly located for where we wanted to be. Would return.",8,Richard,2023-10-24

Penn Stationから徒歩数分、PAのバスターミナル至近、その他各地下鉄Lineの駅も近く交通至便。Broadwayなども近く観光には便利です。ただ、ホテルの立ち並ぶ地区ですが浮浪者や怪しい人間もウロウロしているので、あまり環境は良くないです。部屋は、キッチン及び食器・調理器具等一通り揃っているので、この物価高の折、簡単に調理できるのはメリット。付近にスーパー等もあります。朝食は、簡単なおかずに、パン、ベーグル、ヨーグルト、フルーツがあり十分でしょう。気になったのは。時分時のエレベーター。混雑して乗れないことも多くマイナス点。総じて、価格対比の満足度は高いです。,8,Yuichi,2023-10-23

In fact after waiting for over 30 minutes we finally had to take the stairs to get out of the building, This happened on two separate days! All the other guests that we spoke with also complained about the elevators and there was a steady stream of people taking the stairs to get down.
Also, several times during our stay there was no hot water for a shower. However the water from the cold faucet became quite warm. Weird.",4,Terry,2023-10-22

"I stayed here with two other couples. Our check-in didn't happen until 4pm, which proved inconvenient, but at least we were able to leave our bags with the hotel. Staff were accommodating. It's close to a whole lot of places, which made walking convenient (preferably in groups). The food provided was very good and we were pleased with the experience as a whole.
While the hotel was decent, it had clearly seen better days: outside, there's a very visible homeless population and drug use, which makes going out after dark uncomfortable (but thats New York overall these days, I suppose). Inside, the lobby is pretty nice. The elevator is fast but in high demand, which makes peak times tough to navigate. Our room was fairly clean but the shower was wobbly and the water temperature unpredictable. The room phone didn't work at all. Our room had evidence of having been broken into in the past. 
All in all, a decent place to stay for a few days, especially for New York City, but keep in mind the limitations.",8,Genevieve,2023-10-19
"Great hotel in a fabulous location.  The staff are super friendly.  My only observation (but not a complaint) is that the elevators are incredibly busy in the mornings.  There are only 3 elevators serving more than 40 floors (we found often 1 was out of action), so you can wait up to 20 mins to fit into one if you are unable to take the stairs.  Not ideal if you have to get to a meeting/airport etc
Breakfast was fabulous, so many options / choices and the hot food choices each day was different.  The restaurant gets very busy but the reception area has some seating and a breakfast bar type area you can use.  We were there for 7 nights and never went without somewhere to sit and eat.
Hot coffee/tea etc available all day and I heard there are hot snacks available in the afternoons.  I would definitely use this hotel again, perfect location for tourists ... 5 minute walk from Times Square",10,Carol,2023-10-19

"It was very dirty outside, at night a congregation of homeless addicts stayed next door. Every other place we have stayed over the years, attempts to clean the garbage and wash off the urine, but in a week we never saw it. 2 of 3 elevators were very slow and can only fit 14 people “nuts to butts” because everyone crams in, the other barely ran.it takes over an hour to go up or down(not exaggerating) The room had loose handles and poorly patched dry wall holes. The shade over the window, tapped the wall all night if you run the fan or ac unit. The computers were broken the whole week. A convenient location for our event. ",4,Stephanie,2023-10-18

Abbiamo soggiornato al 40° piano, stupenda la vista del piccolo rooftop sopra l'hotel, da una parte si vedeva Edge e dall'altra Empire State Building.

"Arrived at hotel noon-ish but could not get into room until after 3 pm.  Room only had 1 set of towels, even though it was confirmed for 2 people at front desk.  At breakfast the next morning the eggs were gone, but the server said they would have more ""in 10 minutes"".  40 minutes later they still hadn't appeared.  Finally had to ask the food manager for eggs and he stated they were liquid and would take too long to get ready.  Then two orders (very overcooked and rubbery) appeared.  Huh?  Room itself was comfortable.  I would rate this hotel OK, but nothing special and certainly not worth the price charged.  Heaven help you if anything should happen and you needed to exit the hotel in a hurry.  The elevators are very overcrowded and you wait 10+ minutes to get one during ""rush"" hours.  Not really up to Marriott's usual standards.  ",6,Lawrence,2023-10-14

"The hotel was clean and the people were nice. There was no cold water in the upper floors, everything was scalding hot water. The maintenance guy said the room we were in should not have even been sold. We went thru 3 rooms until we found one with cold water. The phones didn't work in the upper floors which I felt was a fire hazard. I'm normally a very easy going person but when you have to turn the water off and on because it's too hot is a major issue for me. The location was good, homeless around but that's not unusual. Good cheap Falafel restaurant across the street.

"L'hotel si trova in una buona posizione, centrale, ma la via in cui è ubicato è mal frequentata. Dovevamo tutte le sere passare sul marciapiede opposto, che comunque non era super tranquillo.
All'arrivo mi è stato addebitato un deposito di quasi 500 euro anzichè 250 come scritto nel momento della prenotazione. Ho chiesto il perchè ma mi è stato detto che era così e basta.
Per quanto riguarda la stanza invece, ho pagato euro 39 in più perchè a loro dire, in quel giorno la conversione da dollari ad euro era cambiata. Non è per i 39 euro ma questione di principio
Queste cose non mi sono piaciute per niente.
La ragazza Irma alla reception è sempre stata fantastica, super gentile. L'altra invece, mi pare si chiamasse Sarah, molto scorbutica e per niente disponibile.

It wasn’t an issue at all for us. Breakfast is great - some days you get a table some days you don’t. Would recommend this hotel & location is excellent. ,10,Megan,2023-09-30

"wir hatten Andrea beim Einchecken und sie war sehr nett. Bei den restlichen Mitarbeitern hatte man eher das Gefühl, man würde nerven. 

Wir mussten mehrmals am Empfang mitteilen, dass das Wasser bei unserer Dusche brühend heiß ist und man das Wasser nicht kälter stellen kann. Deswegen konnten wir die ersten 2 Tage nicht duschen. 

Wir mussten auch wegen frischen Handtüchern und der Zimmerreinigung nachfragen. Da hieß es dann, wir hätten die Reinigung abgelehnt, was nicht der Fall war.

Das Frühstück war für NYC Verhältnisse ziemlich gut. Wir würden jedoch nicht noch einmal im Elements übernachten. ",6,Jessica,2023-09-25

"We picked this hotel because it said each room has a kitchette and that's better than hoping to get a fridge at other hotels. The kitchette was great to have even though we did not actually cook in it. The room was big, not quite enough storage for an eight day stay but we made it work. The view from our city view room was fantastic. Hotel location is perfect.
There is breakfast every more and they have a lot of hot and cold items to choose from and it is open later than most hotels. 
There is also a happy hour but it is short and only a few days during the week so we never got to experience that. 
There is a rooftop patio but nothing is up there except seating options and a great view.
The only thing about this hotel that is not great are the elevators. We were on floor 38 and sometimes it would be heading up only to head back down. You just had to get used to it and plan accordingly, give extra time for the elevator when heading out to something. 
Overall we really enjoyed our stay.",10,Susan,2023-09-21

Os pontos mais altos em relação com outros hotéis, que me hospedei em Manhattan foram a academia com ótimos equipamentos e o desjejum completo/variado. Excepcional o happy hour. Tudo ao contrário dos comentários que li .

Elevators are a big issue, long waits, thankfully we were on a lower level and often had to take the stairs. House keeping comes every other day, which resulted in an issue where we were not given enough towels due to delivery issues and in desperation had to use hand towels that night to shower as there was no ETA on the shipment of towels.

"Element was clean, staff was amazing; friendly, courteous and helpful. Breakfast was very good and varied with a lot of options/food choices. Eggs were hot, as was the protein of the day.  Cold cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, bread, bagels and mini muffins etc. We were in 2202 - super AC, nice kitchenette, clean bathroom and shower. Room was small but adequaye - a little tight squeeze between the wall and one side of the bed. Great pillows! Water was an issue. NO COLD WATER, especially for the bathroom sink - both faucets were hot, hot, hot. One out of the 4 nights we were there, the shower had only hot water. Given we were there when it was in the upper 80's and humid, a cool shower is essential for one's sanity! The Element was close to the theaters, hop on hop off buses and many places to eat, snack etc. ",8,Russell,2023-09-12

Inoltre l lunedì e il giovedì dalle 17:00 alle 18:30 circa offrono un aperitivo agli ospiti con birra, vino e cibo a volontà. La colazione era abbondante e buonissima, sia dolce che salata. Le pulizie delle stanze vengono effettuate a giorni alterni tuttavia ci si può rivolgere in reception per qualsiasi richiesta di asciugamani o lenzuola pulite o prodotti per il bagno.

" No início tive q pedir para arrumarem o quarto, após 4 dias sem arrumação, mas depois se normalizou.  Elevadores demorados são realidades. Um dia esperei meia hora para descer (depois de ter ligado para recepção pedindo q parasse no andar) e desisti. Desci os 22 andares pela escada. Por 3 vezes tive q ir de escada ( principalmente FDS). Para um prédio de 40 andares 3 elevadores (sendo que um estava quebrado) é muito pouco. Períodos
Da manhã e noite/fim de tarde são críticos. 
Café da manhã ou vai bem cedo ou tem q ter paciência pra achar mesa disponível.
Pra minha surpresa , cobraram 2 vezes a despesa no cartão da nomad q acabou sendo bloqueado. Tive q esperar 7 dias úteis para que a cobrança em duplicidade fosse estornada.  Se minha viagem continuasse  estaria com o cartão bloqueado ou com saldo deduzido duas vezes
Quarto e muito bom, confortável e com pequena cozinha muito útil ao chegar cansado a noite e comer algo rápido. 
Bem localizado e perto de Times Square, que achei muito bom. Como não cobra taxa de ressort acho que vale considerar, levando em conta a questão do elevador que vai enfrentar. Como NY tem muitos hotéis na próxima vez pretendo ficar em outro. ",8,Rafael,2023-09-10
"Central location, good for accessing tourist areas.
The area outside however had a lot of people begging and sleeping in doorways.
Staff were dismissive and not very helpful other than one Spanish speaking lady. 
The breakfast area is way too small for the amount of guests in the hotel.
The wait time for lifts was excessive.
The stairs (fire escape) often had rubbish obstructing the path. There was also broken glass on the stairs which although reported to staff took two days to clean up. 
The room was comfortable and had everything you needed. ",6,karen,2023-09-09
"Me hospedei em agosto de 2023, 9 diárias, no geral o hotel é muito bom, quarto é grande, cama confortável, limpeza é ok, a questão do elevador é algo que incomoda um pouco, mas não tive nenhum contratempo com isso, eu fiquei hospedado no ultimo andar do hotel então sempre que o elevador chegava lá ele estava vazio,  o tempo de espera dele no meu caso não foi problema.
O Café da manhã é padrão americano, ovos todo os dias, e muda alguns acompanhamentos todos os dias, porem como fiquei 9 dias chegou a repetir o que estava sendo servido, mas no geral café é bom e ajuda muito pra começar bem o dia.
2 vezes na semana tem um happy hour no hotel com cervejas, vinhos e tabuas de frios liberados. 
A localização é algo muito positivo, média de 10min apé você já está na Times, metro perto também, visitei muitos pontos turisticos indo apé mesmo ou utilizando o metro.
Perto do hotel geralmente mais a noite tinha um aglomero de moradores de rua, porem em nenhum dia tive algum problema com eles.

So we stayed in that room, although it felt it was under remodeling with an open space for a dishwasher and some wall perforations without a frame. The popcorn and social hour in the afternoons was s very nice plus! This is a 40 story hotel! waiting for the elevator was a little nightmare and all the stops to reach lobby. Breakfast was a zoo. Too many people ""fighting"" for space, toaster, etc. The hotel is very central and well located to walk in Times square and neighbourhoods around, the only problem was that in the hotel street there were a lot of homeless smoking pod and doing drugs. Not a nice image when you are walking by with teenagers in your party. NYPD should do something about it. All the Times square area is like this and they pass by ignoring it.

"Wonderful stay, beginning with a friendly, professional greeting upon check-in by Sara. Very informative and engaging. Well-appointed room, very clean with stunning views from the 39th floor, from  Empire state to The Edge and beyond. Room was spacious (for NY) with full kitchenette, large bathroom, desk, wardrobe and loveseat. Bed was incredibly comfortable. Only thing missing was a unit with drawers to unpack, especially for a 6 night stay.
Water pressure was terrific in shower with rainshiwer and hand-held options. Minor setback was no COLD water and almost scalding my back. Reported it and maintenance had it repaired by the afternoon. Thank you.
Housekeeping is every other day, which was perfect.
Two observations: towels/washcloths need an upgrade. A bit coarse and scratchy. And, being a brand name hotel, a full size ironing board would be much more appropriate than the dreadfully old countertop model. 
AC unit was a blessing. 
Breakfast: great options, with hot items in rotation. Make sure you start your day early or you'll be stanfing with items regularly running out. Twice I asked the front desk to have management assist with replenishing food and emptying trash. 
Happy hour: similar replenishment issues, also, could use assistance pouring beer/wine. Maybe pre-pour wine behind counter.
Allowed extra hour for check-out, as well as bag storage while I took in last matinee.
Easy walking. Close to subway. Just be aware and use common sense.
Overall, great stay!! Thank you!",10,Martin,2023-08-29

We were on the 29th floor, and when you looked to the right, it was the Edge in view and looked to the left it was The Empire State Building. The room had a whole kitchen, and it was real clean and smelt like Pine-Sol our whole stay. The roof had a lounge area that gave off a good lit view of Times Square. Beautiful.

I moved to a different room halfway through my stay, and I forgot one item. I reported the missing item later that day, and the housekeeping staff claimed it was not left in the room. This was not an item that someone would want to take, which leads me to believe that they just threw it away. When you go to the management with a problem, they either dismiss it and don't do anything or get defensive when you push for the problem to be resolved. My biggest problem was with smoking/ vaping going on in the hotel. There are signs claiming that you can breathe easy all over the hotel because it is non smoking, but when I reported almost constant vaping when in my room, they ignored the problem repeatedly. When I finally asked for a manager and was describing the details of the issue, the manager said something about it being a lecture. Communicating a problem is not a lecture, and customers coming to management for help with an issue shouldn't be treated as a burden. I believe another manager finally took some steps to mitigate the problem, but non smoking hotels really need to enforce the non smoking policy. Otherwise, it's just a smoking hotel. I have a serious allergy/ asthma reaction to vape specifically, and I was having trouble breathing, and my ears were popping painful for much of my stay",4,Stacy,2023-08-18
"El hotel es increíble, el desayuno y los complementos que ofrecen como la hora relax, es lo máximo, de mucha ayuda cuando regresas de pasear todo el día por la ciudad, regresar y poder tomar un vino o cerveza se agradece, el servicio es increíble sobretodo destaco la amabilidad y servicio de Wilma, toda nuestra estancia fue perfecta las habitaciones de muy buen tamaño y con una vista espectacular. Si tuviera que elegir algo que mejorar sería el tema del elevador, en cuanto a la zona del hotel es muy céntrica, caminas a todos lados y hay metro y bus cerca, desafortunadamente como muchas calles de Manhattan hay mucha gente en situación de calle y por las noches puede llegar a dar miedo, entiendo que es algo que el hotel no puede mejorar porque está fuera de sus manos pero quizá poner vigilante afuera por cualquier cosa sería de mucha ayuda o mayor iluminación, fuera de eso todo fue increíble. Sin duda lo repetiremos mi familia y yo. ",10,ISAURA,2023-08-17

The room wasn't ready at our arrival around 2 hours late after check-in time. They stored our luggages and offered a late check-out for the next day.",8,Eve-Marie,2023-08-14

"When we arrived there was only one body towel in the bathroom, we requested a second one, took them 2 days to get it. They offered room cleaning every other day, but they didnt cleaned our room in 3 days in a row, the laundry room was not working, had to walk to a laundromatic 1 block away under the rain.",4,Rodrigo,2023-08-11
"Very good hotel.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Cleanliness was not an issue at all.  Breakfast was OK. Complimentary happy hour at 5 PM was better.  Can't speak for other rooms, but we had a great view of 8th Avenue facing north.  Excellent proximity to Broadway, Times Square and dining options by foot, and great transportation options for longer trips.  The cold water faucet sometimes ran warm, but that was an occasional inconvenience.  The elevators can be busy at times, but not unreasonably so.  The neighborhood is noisy, somewhat dirty and has its fair share of interesting locals wandering the streets, but that's part of what makes NYC what it is.  Without a doubt, I'd stay here again.",10,Justin Edward Che,2023-08-11
"Loved the free breakfast, open bar 5:30-6:30. Cold water at the lobby everytime you come in from a long day of walking was very refreshing. Just 1 comment for the bed which has sharp edges. ",8,Mex,2023-08-10

"We just got in from celebrating 50th wedding anniversary in Paris, France.  I noticed checkin times for Element, tried be proactive, called hotel advised them of late arrival.  They referred me to Expedia, Ms. Lane of Expedia contacted Element NY, they approved late checkin and provided name, Wilma Fiori"" as POC if encountered any problems.  

We finally got in to Manhattan tonight, taxi dropped off at Element and Mr. Oliver advised no room and gave copy of letter, dated today, written by a Marie Dessources, to a Citadines Connect Fifth Avenue, asking to accommodate us.  Mr. Oliver was given details regarding Expedia conversation with Ms. Fiori which had no impact. He advised that Citadines was part of  Marriott, if so, shame on them!  This pace is filthy and unsafe and further away from Penn Station train station.  Disappointed in the falsehoods, poor disregard for our safety, and callous atttitude received from Element NY.  I would like to speak to a manager regarding the above, ASAP.

Thank you!",2,Betty,2023-08-10

"Rooms weren’t cleaned after begging 3 separate times to have it done.  Supposed to be every other day.  Day 3 still nothing.  We had no toilet paper and no paper towel, no towels to shower with. it was midnight after an extremely long day and I had to go wait at the front desk for 40 minutes to get some toilet paper so I could use the washroom.  Our garbages were so full we couldn’t fit anything else in them so we had to put our garbage bins out by our door, they then emptied them.  I had to ask the cleaner on our floor why our room wasn’t being cleaned and she said it was the day before, I told her no, it wasn’t.  They then came in to clean it.  Staff doesn’t speak a lick of English and had to use a translation app to speak to them.  Front desk didn’t seem to care or hurry.  We spoke to the manager twice and still nothing got done.  Do NOT recommend.  If anything happens they offer you nothing but a pathetic insincere apology.  We asked for some money back.  Again, nobody cared or listened.  Go at your own risk but be warned.  Customer service is awful.  ",4,Melanie,2023-08-06

Puisqu’il y a beaucoup d’étages, les ascenseurs sont souvent remplis et on doit en rappeler une autre.  Peu de table pour le déjeuner donc on doit « spotter » ceux qui ont presque terminé pour prendre leur place. Quelques itinérants sur la rue pour se rendre à l’hôtel, mais quand même sécuritaire parce qu’il y a beaucoup de monde, et un garde de sécurité est à l’entrée de l’hôtel à partir de fin d’après-midi. On s’y sentait en sécurité.",8,Claudie,2023-08-05
"In 9 days I had 3 separate reservations. During 2 of the 3 check-ins I had to switch rooms because the door locks were broken. One room, all you had to do was push with one hand, and the door totally opened. Once I waited for over 2 hours for engineering to come. I wasn't waiting again. The manager walks back and forth, but doesn't help check-in long lines of guests. The area was fine a year ago. Now it's a wreck. ",4,MICHAEL,2023-08-05

"Hotellet har ett centralt läge nära Times Square med gångavstånd till det mesta i midtown. Gratis frukost var bra även om det inte var någon riktig frukostbuffé så var det smidigt att kunna äta på hotellet. Vi bodde på 5e våningen med utsikt över en smutsig bakgård, inte det minsta trevligt. Enda fördelen var att man kunde ta trapporna ner, hissarna var alltid upptagna. Det fanns 3 hissar för 40 våningar. Servicen var uselt. Rummen städades varanan dag, det fylldes på dåligt med toapapper och tvål. Trots att vi sade till i receptionen så fylldes det inte på med toapapper, utan jag fick springa efter städpersonalen och fråga. En dag när vi kom hem på kvällen så hade städpersonalen lämnat dörren till vårt rum olåst! Ingenting var stulet som tur var. Området i sig är lite stökigt, mycket uteliggare och missbrukare runt omkring. Är man känslig mot sånt bör man välja ett annat område.",4,Cheng,2023-07-22

"Hotel was in a good location 8 min to subway trains which is what we used a lot, very economical. Everything was good and clean, lobby, breakfast area and food. The happy hour was great. Room wise it was nice and clean. But, water filter for drinking tap water was suppose to be replaced 2020! They had no filters and were going to arrive ""in a couple days"" never got one in my 5 days. Instead got a bunch of water bottles, thanks. My phone wasn't working and they had no extras, and ""phone company had been notified."" Had to use my phone to contact front desk. Staff were nice by the way. We had to also call because our room had no face or body soap the first 2 days. The remote for the TV would work here and there like lagging a lot, maybe the hotel system. In our 3rd day we discovered our room shower grab handle had corded screws so was only being held by one side, fall hazard, we did mention it to engineering guy, but we didn't want to go through the hassle to go downstairs, explain hope for a better room risk it and pack up move and unpack. Overall for the price and service I would stay again but definitely check the room right away thoroughly. One more thing I was suppose to get a text when the room was ready to check in, instead of 3pm it was 530pm, not fun.",4,Javier,2023-07-18

The room was ok but bed was so close to the HVAC unit that I bumped my shin on the corner everytime I tried to get to that side of the bed. But all-in-all it was ok EXCEPT for the bathroom towels.

I just had a surgery and needs to take a meds that will make me drowsy so I requested to make an early check in. We change hotel from Courtyard New York World Trade Center to Element. We were told that I will receive a text if it will be possible for early check in. We still went to the hotel thinking maybe we can ask assistance personally. The front desk guy was friendly and accommodating. He told us to come back around 230pm. I came back at 230pm with a different front desk person and not that friendly and told me that check in might be after 3pm. That’s kinda long time :( So I came back at around 3pm as I saw online that I am checked in already. The 2 younger front desk person are not into jumping to customers and we waited for a long time. Hopefully they will be more friendly and don’t let the customers wait for a long time or at least acknowledge us to wait for awhile and not to avoid having eye contact.,6,Sheila,2023-07-10

When i got to the front desk Aliha's seemed annoyed by the situation and the inconvenience for them this was basically, not once showing any concern on how the guests where feeling.

"Nous avions l'habitude de louer un appartement à New York à l'angle de la 39ème rue et de la 5ème avenue , mais celui-ci a été vendu l'année dernière . Alors , pour la 36ème fois à Manhattan , après un circuit d'un mois et demi , nous avons décidé de n'y passer que 5 jours,mais qu'elle hôtel choisir? Mon épouse a opté pour ""l'Element""pour sa situation et son prix plus que raisonnable pour Manhattan . Super emplacement ( quasi à l'angle de de la 39ème et de la 8èmè avenue ),à 3 minutes de Time Suare ,des theatres etc ... Mais ce qui nous a le plus étonné , cela a été l'accueil très pro , la chambre parfaite équipée de tout ( kitchenette entièrement équipée ) et située à l'étage que nous avions demandé . Le petit déjeuner hyper complet , parfait et même une collation offerte la semaine à 5 PM . Seul bémol , l'attente à l'ascenseur fréquent à certaines heures , surtout au petit déjeuner , mais nous avions demandé à être au 5ème étage et nous descendions par l'escalier ... Toujours bon pour la santé ..Un ascenseur supplémentaire ne serait malgré tout pas de trop pour un immeuble de 40 étages .                                   Nous sommes heureux d'avoir définitivement trouvé notre nouveau point de chute pour Manhattan . A bientôt et encore merci à toute l'équipe .",10,BRUNO,2023-07-02

Had issues with the room phone -- constantly beeping or making a noise.  Finally had to have it removed.  Bathroom sink plunger constantly getting stuck in the closed position -- had to have an engineer fix twice. Elevators way too slow and not enough for number of guests..  Homeless individuals living and defecating/urinating nearby on front sidewalk. Drug deals conducted every time we walked by. Garbage on sidewalk never picked up until the fifth day of stay - smelled badly.  Did like the kitchenette and two layered curtains. Nice to have a convenient and free breakfast.  Staff was responsive when I did have complaints about phone and sink -- both taken care of.  Comfortable bed.  ,6,Michelle Dawn,2023-06-25

"Please +1 our review! We stayed at Element New York Times Square West for 6 nights on floor 31 to attend a conference, visit friends, eat great food, and see shows. What we loved was having fast internet, gorgeous city view, full breakfast spread (eggs, meats, grains, yogurt, juices, fruit), bathroom with a working shower and toilet, medium-sized gym (5 treadmills, 1 cycling, several weights, yoga mats), full kitchenette, luggage hold, 24/7 access to drinks (coffee, water, lemon water, teas), closeness to subway entrances and fast food, and helpful staff. We had no issues with the 3 elevators, stairs, hotel lobby, room being cleaned every other day, bedroom mattress, checkin, checkout, fresh afternoon popcorn, and small rooftop. We had minor issues with reporting room problems, finding table for breakfast, running out of food during happy hour, finding taxi or rideshare, not having enough hangers, and having sketchy people near the entrance. Aside from its wear and tear, the major issue we encountered is that the cold water faucet in our room would initially run very hot and would only be colder after running the water at least five minutes. Nevertheless, we would definitely consider staying again given our overall good experience.",10,John,2023-06-22

"The Hotel is an old structure. The staff tries their best to suit your needs. Housekeeping is not provided daily. Breakfast is the same every day without variations. We had to complain about our shower head broken. They sent an engineer to fix it. It was a temporary fix. It broke again and we had to change rooms. The elevators are always crowded. Not enough staff to take care of all your needs. The location is between 8th and 9th avenue, but the area is not too nice for a stay. The only good thing is that it has a full kitchen. If you travel with family, you save a lot in eating if you go to the grocery store. It is not for a weekend stay. Too crowded. The staff do their best despite the working circumstances.",6,ARLYN,2023-06-16

"The location was good; good price-quality ratio. Enough choices for breakfast; the complementary happy hour mon-thur is a nice gesture.
The room is not too big but the kitchenette is good enough. The matras was a bit weary and there was only 1 chair for the desk and 1 bar seat for the high table, so a couple can’t sit together to eat at the same table.
The cleaning is every other day and that’s where it can get mixed up and ‘forgotten’. Maintenance replies pretty fair to fix-requests. A real negative thing is the shower drainage which is at one side, but the lowest point of the floor is at the other side at the shower door (construction issue?) so that you’ll step directly into the water pool of the previous user (your co-traveler) even many hours or a day later. It just cannot drain away without sweeping it with your feet. And it’s been going on for a while ‘cause the floor paint is peeling away.",8,Vanessa,2023-05-30

"You have a very efficient property. The room 1401 was small but came equiped so thoroughly that I could have stayed a long time by just getting stuff at the 7-11 on the corner. The shower was outstanding. Kudos to your breakfast staff which served different eggs and sausage each day. I was particularly impressed with their keeping surfaces clean and coffee dispensers full. They could have cleared tables in sitting areas more quickly as I saw a lot of people clearing the tables themselves. The location next to an Irish pub was great. However, the homeless and others congregating between your site and 8th Ave. would give one to pause. In 1401, the toilet occasionally kept running after a flush and I had to pull off the cover and maneuver the push buttons to their correct position. Also the lights mysteriously turned on in the middle of the night. Overall, I might stay at your place again.

The poor quality of the breakfast appliances provoked a bad experience for all guests, forming huge lines waiting for their toasts or bagels.
It's important to note that these appliances are all connected to an external power cord, increasing the electrical shock risks and fire.

"Struttura in posizione comoda ma contornata da gente nella strada adiacente poco raccomandabile..per arrivare all’albergo abbiamo dovuto fare lo slalom tra homless buttati in terra, alcuni dei quali che si bucavano con le siringhe..per non parlare dell’urto stoiò costante e la puzza di marijuana che ci ha accompagnato quasi sempre..la camera che abbiamo preso era molto bella ma purtroppo le pulizie non vengono fatte giornalmente nonostante c’è scrittoio sito che sono giornaliere..
Altra pecca grandissima sono gli ascensori..sono 3 per 40 piani e in più occasioni abbiamo dovuto aspettare 20 minuti !!!!!! per scendere..
La colazione è accettabile ma con poca scelta..
Per finire il personale e’ distaccato e poco socievole..peccato perché la struttura non è niente male",6,Gianluca,2023-05-22

"This hotel is about 5 blocks North of being truly convenient for walking to major destinations like Times Square, most theaters, Rockefeller Center, etc. I prefer staying closer to 45th so you’re a little more centralized and don’t have to pass by the VERY crowded Port Authority Bus Terminal. Pros: our room had a kitchen with a large fridge/freezer, stovetop, and microwave. That was awesome! We also loved the rooftop seating area and full (free!) breakfast buffet. Cons: Our room had very little space to things/clothes and was a little dirty. The elevators were also busy, slow (up to 15 min wait in the mornings), and a little scary/old.

"o Element times Square na rua 39, do lado Port Authoroty (rodoviária ).Achei ótima localização, o metrô fica na rua 40 então era praticamente só virar a esquina que já estava no metrô que serve muitas linhas . 
 Tamanho ótimo, dava pra abrir a mala e andar, banheiro grande, até sofá tinha. Cozinha completa (fogão, geladeira e microondas) . 
Sem taxa de resort, com bom café da manhã.
A diária começa às 15h e termina 12h.
 Eu cheguei às 7h da manhã e eles deixaram eu já tomar café, guardaram minha mala até eu voltar que fiz o check in as 14h ( deixaram entra mais cedo).
Café da manhã eu chegava logo as 7h e quando estava saindo era quando enchia mais ( a parti das 7:45) . 
Elevadores são 3, sempre descia de elevador, as vezes eu subia de escada pq tinha muita gente no lobby e o elevador ainda estava no 30 e poucos andar, mas só pq não queria esperar.
Essa questão do café e do elevador eu entendo que se for em alta temporada ( ação de graças e natal) pode ser o único gargalo do hotel, mas todos os hotéis nessa faixa de preço devem ter esse mesmo problema. Mas isso não afeta em nada a estadia e qualidade do hotel.",10,Leticia,2023-05-12

"Hotel super bem localizado, duas quadras da times square, quarto confortável com pequena cozinha. Infelizmente o hotel que tinha tudo pra ser ótimo acaba sendo decepcionante. 1o dia nos colocaram em um quarto q sabidamente tinha ruidos vindos da tubulacao de agua, um ruido altussimo começava e parava durante a madrugada, juntando com barulho normal da região foi impossivel dormir. Pedi a troca e somente depois do terceiro dia foi efetivada a troca. Novo quarto, ai descubro que a ralo do banheiro entupido, agua do chuveiro voltando, aff , dois dias pra arrumarem..
cafe da manha fraco, dificil conseguir uma mesa pois é bem pequeno espaço.
Ponto positivo pra atendente da noite, que infelizmente me fugiu o nome, as outras não fazem muita questão de serem simpáticas.
 Enfim, pelas outras opções oferecidas na mesma faixa de preço, eu não voltaria a ficar nesse hotel.

"This was a great hotel for our stay in NYC. The location is within walking distance to many popular destinations and public transit. We decided to upgrade for a city view and the upgrade was worth the extra charge.

Pros
Good sized room for NYC
Kitchen includes a fridge with a good sized freezer
Comfy bed
Black-out curtain (much needed at any time of day)
Excellent view of the Empire State building and the South part of Manhatten
Breakfast in the am was decent and a good money saver (the employees that work breakfast hustle and work very hard!)
Excellent location
Housekeeping done every other day, you can request for more cleanings if needed

Tips/Cons
The elevators are slow and very busy in the morning. Another great reason to be on a higher floor, pick-up is easy and you dont run the risk of the elevator being full. Schedule in some extra time for the elevators.
The breakfast area is very busy and tables are usually full, go early or late. We started showing up 15 minutes to closing and had coffee, all the food options and found a seat!
Be mindful of your surroundings when walking around. There are people every where and some of the sidewalks are not clean.
Overall, we had a great time at this hotel and would stay again.",10,Katie,2023-05-05
"This property has potential to be really good, but they missed the mark.  We had to change rooms 3 times due to the room not being cleaned when they checked us in, there was a loud buzzing noise that went on the entire night, so we did not get any sleep.  Their stairway door slammed every time it closed.  The air conditioning unit/heater was right beside the bed, so if you got up in the middle of the night you ended up banging into it.  The rooms were not cleaned at a reasonable time.  They came in when we were getting ready for dinner.  They tied up the elevators with the cleaning staff during peak times (breakfast and dinner hour) so people only had access to 2 elevators. There are 28 floors, so this created a huge inconvenience!  Very disappointing!!!.",2,Gail,2023-05-05

"We stayed at Element for three nights, and on the first night, we discovered that the shower faucet handle had fallen off and landed on the floor. We could temporarily put it back on, but it wouldn't stay in place. Additionally, the hot water in the shower would suddenly become scalding hot and the air conditioning had a musty smell. We reported the problems to the front desk, and they said they would send an engineer to fix them. When we returned to our room in the evening, only the faucet handle had been fixed, and the other issues remained.

On the second day, we went to the front desk again. A very friendly lady named Rebecca listened to our story and immediately agreed to change our room. The new room was completely problem-free. We are extremely grateful to Rebecca for saving our accommodation experience in Manhattan!

Overall, the location is very convenient, and the rooms are well-equipped with facilities such as an electric stove, dishwasher, cutting board, knives, and tableware, allowing guests to cook for themselves. As a result, the hotel has a very, very high number of guests, especially during breakfast when even seating requires waiting in line. It is apparent that the hotel is understaffed and unable to properly clean and prepare rooms after guests check out for the next night's guests. Fortunately, the staff is friendly and helpful.  We hope the management pays attention to the mentioned issues!",8,Li-yang,2023-04-26

There were far, far too many people; the hotel elevators couldn't handle the volume in a timely way and the lines at breakfast were unlike any I've ever seen, and there was nowhere to sit to eat. Finally, the bedroom floor could have been cleaner. It felt expensive for what we got.",6,Heather,2023-04-24
"The hotel room was clean and spacious for a new York suite. My only complaint was the elevators. There are not enough elevators to accommodate the amount of guests during breakfast, check-in and check out time.

"The property location was great, it was very easy to walk everywhere. With that said, it was just down a side street that had some questionable activity which you walked by whenever you went to and from the front entrance. The room was decent but, not necessarily the cleanest; there was body hair on the shower floor from previous guests and one of the lights did not work on the bathroom mirror. The noise from the street wasn’t horrendous, you only heard the occasional street noise. There are only 3 elevators for the entire hotel (a total of 40 floors). The line for the elevator could be long but, for better or worse, we used a little trick. Whenever waiting, we would hit the “up” elevator arrow instead of the “down.” We were always able to hop on an elevator going up, and ride it back down, without problem. In fact, we used this truck when we were waiting with others; we would hop on the “up” elevator and they didn’t. By the time we went up and came back down, the other people were still waiting and our elevator was full; they were not able to hop on and continued to wait. ",8,Heather,2023-04-17

Cons:  The hallway carpet is dirty; the door to my room was damaged and did not close properly (so much so that I felt my security was compromised); the shower did not work properly; despite a thermostat, the temperature in the room was inconsistent; and there was no streaming internet.  Three days into our 6-night stay, we asked for a room change and the staff was accommodating.  However, I will not stay here again.",4,Loretta,2023-03-31

"Staff was very friendly and nice. The daily breakfast was nice to have for ease and there was something for everyone. They were able to give us adjoining rooms which was great.  Dry close to the subway that was a major connecting point and very convenient. The cons: pretty hard to get an elevator so I’d recommend staying on lower floors so you can take the stairs. We had to carry our luggage down 11 flights after waiting 25 minutes for an elevator. Also, for some reason one of the motion sensor lights would not stop coming on during the middle of the night. They put tape over the sensor but it still came on at least twice a night. ",6,Christine,2023-03-27
It was close enough to walk to most attractions and museums.  The full size fridge and microwave saved a fortune with leftovers and drinks.  Things requested were responded to quickly ,8,melanie,2023-03-26
Great location within walk distance from subway and Times Square.,10,Eric,2023-03-26
Ok facilities and good breakfast. Our hotel room was either broken into or the cleaning staff left it open while we were at a show. We came back to the room to find it wide open and the door split down the side from the lock set. The door had never fit well — it had a significant gap from floor to door bottom that we had had to stuff with towels the first two nights there. ,6,Anna,2023-03-26

Great location. Good breakfast BUT really busy no place to sit and took back to our room - probably a plus. Lifts always busy and long waits.  So many people ond floors and only 3 small lifts.  Good washing machine.  Limited house keeping so no replacement of tea dishwasher tablets.  Would probably stay here again for location and sink and microwave. ,6,Susan,2023-03-18

What can you do when it’s free? lol. Also the water was very cold and then the sink was burning hot. It was weird. Lastly, lots of the drywall kept falling out, the towel bar would fall randomly in the middle of the night, and the elevator would have some technical difficulties. It would sometimes leave us on the wrong floor. Overall it was mainly a place to stay so you get what you pay. ",6,Mariana,2023-03-16

My room was just ok because it didn’t look kept up: caulking poorly done in the bathroom, smears of it on the floor, bed wasn’t the best, creaked, not that comfy but ok.

"Element was surprisingly a better accommodation than I had initially anticipated. The staff was great and the location was good for our stay.  The breakfast that was provided had multiple selections for even the pickiest of eaters (me). The only negative thing I encountered was the elevators. Being on the 9th floor guaranteed you would be in a very crowded elevator or that you’d be taking the stairs down. Overall, our stay was suitable for our needs.",10,Hersha,2023-03-08

"I thought this hotel was a good value for the location.  It was really convenient to attractions in Times Square, the subway, plenty of options for restaurants, etc.  We were upgraded (I think) to a room that had a kitchen which was a nice surprise.  The room is small, but that is to be expected, and I have definitely stayed in smaller rooms.  The bathroom was a good size and the shower was great.  The free breakfast was also a nice amenity.
The only negatives:  they only do housekeeping every other day, which I'm ok with as long as I have enough stuff to get me through.  They should supply more towels, toilet paper and coffee in particular.  There is a sign noting that you can request additional items on days where there is no housekeeping but reality is, the requests go unanswered (and to be clear, we did not run out of toilet paper, but were down to very little on the roll, they did not leave a spare roll) and the coffee was never replenished during our five day stay.  Elevators are also really slow during peak times, luckily we were on floor 8 so could take the stairs and were never in a rush. 
But overall, I was happy with this hotel and would stay there again.",8,Tamra,2023-03-06

"友人と2月末に3泊させて頂きました。
フロントの方の対応も丁寧で、英語が得意でない私たちにも分かるようにゆっくり配慮して対応して頂けました。

部屋はアメリカでのホテルと考えれば、とても清潔にされていると思います。水回りも清潔で、若干潔癖気味の私たちでも違和感なく使用する事が出来ました。
シャワーの水圧・温度も快適です。

床は土足文化の国ですので、やはりスリッパもしくはビーチサンダルは必須です。しかしソファやベッドはとても綺麗で安心して過ごせました。

他の方の口コミにもあるように、エレベーターは時間がかかります。今回はリクエストして8階だったので運動がてら階段を使用していました。高層階や中層階の方々は、エレベーター待ちで大変そうでした。

朝食も種類は多くありませんが、エッグやソーセージ、ベーコン、数種類のシリアルやパン、ヨーグルトからフルーツまで揃っています。
コーヒーや紅茶、オレンジ等のジュース類もあるので３日間飽きる事なく朝からしっかりお腹いっぱいになりました。

ホテル前の通りが少し治安が気になるかなと思いますが、人通りも多いですし50mほど歩けば大きな通りに出るので、23時頃女性2人でも早足で通りホテルに戻ることが出来ました。
フロントにも複数人スタッフがいることと、アイコンタクトや話しかけてくれるため安心感があります。

総合的にはとても満足しています。物価が高騰している中で朝食付き、さらに清潔感もありお値段も手頃、立地も抜群ですのでぜひまた宿泊させて頂きたいと思います。",8,AYANA,2023-03-05

"The Room was very Spacious (and the best price) which was one of the main reasons for choosing the Element Hotel. Despite the Spacious Shower, there was a Drainage issue from the drain and a minor leak with the Kitchen Sink however, none of which put a damper on our stay. The front desk was notified and appreciative of the update upon checkout. The Location of the hotel was close to Time Square which only makes it a little louder, the windows could be a little more insulated to help that barrier but again, for the Price and the expected Location, the AC/Heat Unit helped drown out the noise as best as possible!",8,James,2023-02-28

The elevators were extremely crowded. Especially during peak hours.   Smushed in with others.  Had a panic attack in one occasion.   We were not the only ones complaining about this problem.

"This hotel is conveniently located in Manhattan. That is the only appeal. The first room had bugs, a dirty floor, and a broken shower head. We were moved down the hall, which didn’t ease my mind at all; thinking if one room has bugs the entire floor probably has them. The second room just didn’t have enough floor space, they claimed it was the same size as our first room, but we couldn’t maneuver with 3 people. The bathroom door wouldn’t shut all the way, no phone, and the tv was a downgrade; we couldn’t actually stream to the tv in the first suite. needless to say we moved to a third room. Spacious, no view which we compromised to get moved again, and complementary champagne. I wouldn’t stay here again and I don’t recommend this hotel. They need to do some serious renovating, and call pest control.  The only reason I’m not flat lining this review is due to the staff, there were nice, the house keeping staff doesn’t speak English but they did their due diligence to accommodate us throughout our stay.",4,Brittani,2023-02-27

Pague una habitación deluxe y me dieron la primer noche una habitación standard sin siquiera avisarme. Yo había reservado la noche anterior. Me quejé en recepción y al otro día me cambiaron a la que supuestamente muestra la página. Todo eso me hizo perder mucho tiempo. Aparte las vistas no son al Times Square como muestra en las fotos. Es un engaño. Si queda a media cuadra del Times Square pero no entrente. Luego el desayuno no es como se muestra en las fotos tampoco y para ser un hotel “4 estrellas” y lo caro que es, realmente es muy pobre, una bolsa de cartón con un par de cosas adentro… la pandemia ya pasó y ya los hoteles volvieron a brindar desayuno.

"the only good thing about this hotel is the location. everything else was very low quality. there was standing water always in the showers, paint was peeling everywhere, hooks were broken and falling off. the hotel is 50 floors and there are three very small elevators that are perpetually full, so I had to wait over 15 minutes to get an elevator. I asked for fresh towels multiple times and they never arrived. 

overall a very unpleasant stay. but the location is good. ",4,Peter,2023-02-02
"The Front Desk agent Altia was amazing. Our first room had a clogged sink and toilet, but when we called the front desk about it Oliver was not as accommodating as you would expect when it comes to a Marriott property. Thankfully the next day Altia was at the front desk and she was more than happy to switch us out of that room and into another. She was wonderful.",8,Victoria Paola,2023-02-01
Everything was great except for the limited amount of elevators but it didn’t ruin our experience. Would definitely stay here again. Friendly staff and bag concierge ,10,Elijah,2023-02-01

they only clean the room every 2 days and there’s no phone in the room to call the front desk. rooms are very small and it gets very loud. we were on the 6th floor and the elevator button didnt work.,4,Jessica,2023-01-30

"My son and his girlfriend stayed for 3 nights to celebrate his 21st birthday - and had a fabulous time! The attention the hotel gave to my son's special day was exceptional for a large busy hotel. The service, room quality, food and location were all top drawer! A big thank you to the Element.",10,Mark,2023-01-27

"All n all the Element was fine for the money. The rooms need repairs because of so much use, however the elevator situation is horrible. Wait times could be upto 1/2 hour and are small.  Otherwise they offer free breakfast and complimentary wine and beer 4 days out week about 5 to 7 which was really unexpected but great.",8,Marlene,2023-01-25

We really enjoyed our stay. It was right near where we wanted to be. The room was comfy and had a nice size frig and freezer. It had a little kitchenette and two nice beds. Bathroom was nice and only complaint was the bathroom shower floor was a little discolored. We really enjoyed our stay. Loved the popcorn and the little happy hour. Breakfast was good but a little disappointed they didn't have real NY bagels. The place was right across from 2 parking garages. We liked that there was a boba place shop across from it too. Great place for a quick stay,10,Alison,2023-01-19

I wasnt able to check in until over an hour after check-in time. The staff kept telling me the room was almost ready and it took over an hour. Finally I was told that the room was ready. When i went to the room there was garbage on the floor. The bed wasnt made and the pillows was stacked up in the corner. The room wasnt ready.. They was unwilling to upgrade me to a better room. Because of this i was late to a birthday party as I requested a refund and had to find a new hotel. This is the worse experience I've had at any hotel and I'll never go there again. I would like to report to upper corporate ,2,Terrance,2023-01-14
"Great location, within walking distance to attractions and subway. Clean, staff friendly and felt safe. The only thing i wouldnt give a 10 on was the breakfast but thats the way most hotels are. ",10,Judy,2023-01-13
"The Hotel itself is located very close to times square (5 minutes walk) and all the entertainment spots in midtown. we walked here during day time from penn station with luggage.

We were 2 adults + 2 kids and though rooms were tiny , there were other plus points abt this hotel that we went with. 

The  complimentary bfast has decent hot and cold options for the 3 days we ate. 

We stayed on the 4th floor and pretty much used the stairwell.lifts can get busy

room had a small 2 stove kitchen refrigerator/microwave  (no dishwasher)+pots pans. that helped on a few nights we decided to heat soups in the room

the portion of the street(about 50 feet distance) the hotel is on gets a little dingy,but u have regular tourist crowds just 5 minutes away on 8th avenue

we got what we expected from this hotel and enjoyed our christmas trip.

"This was an awful experience with an element hotel. The staff from this hotel is terrible, super rude, and careless. I had a leak in my room, and all my towels were wet. I requested an inspection, but they were two days later to tell me that was nothing to do and because I asked for a solution, they only offered to move to another room that was on the upper floor. I said no because even when the hotel was packed in it had 40 floors only two elevators were working and the majority of the time, I had to take the stairs from the 8th floor. Good things about the hotel: big rooms than the usual in New York and good food.",4,Anala,2023-01-11
The room was small but fit us just fine for the trip. No coffee in the room. No dirty laundry bags. Not enough towels. Some was requested and never received. ,8,Dawn M,2023-01-10

"I like the location of the hotel, distance to TS and subway. The only that disappointed was the elevator. 38 floors and only 1 working elevator working while I stayed there till my last day. I wish the hotel will give their client a comp of one night or something for running the stairs up and down because the elevator line is ridiculous long wait.",6,Hung V,2023-01-08
Everyone was so nice at the location. About ten minutes from everywhere we needed to be.  Breakfast does get crowded so I recommend getting there early.  It was a great stay and would book again,10,wendy,2023-01-08

"Element is a hidden gem while staying in NYC.  Near Times Square, but far away enough to avoid the crowds & noise.  The rooms are great with a mini kitchen - full size refrigerator, microwave, etc.  Rooms are large by NYC standards.  All of the staff I dealt with were friendly and helpful.  ",10,James,2023-01-04
"Les plus: 

- grande chambre bien équipée avec une petite cuisinette et le café gratuit.

- réaction excellente et immédiate de la part de la direction qui a prolongé de 90 minutes la possibilité de prendre le petit-déjeuner lorsqu'un ascenseur est tombé en panne (voir dans les moins) 


Les moins:

- problème de fiabilité de l'entretien des installations (voir la suite).

- il faisait froid à New York quand nous sommes arrivés il faisait un froid glacial à la réception et dans la salle à manger (problème de double porte de l'entrée dont une des deux restait ouverte. Le problème a perduré tout notre séjour). Le personnel de l'accueil travaillait avec leurs manteaux sur le dos.

- le matin entre 8h et 10h, il faut parfois attendre 15 minutes avant d'avoir un ascenseur quand ils sont tous en état de fonctionner.

- 3 ascenseurs dont un est tombé en panne et n'était toujours pas réparé au bout de 5 jours.

- une des prises électriques de notre chambre ne fonctionnait pas, nous l'avons signalé à la réception qui nous a dit qu'ils envoyaient un technicien immédiatement. 7 jours plus tard, le technicien n'était toujours pas passé.",8,Jean-Pierre,2023-01-04
