"Well, the hotel seemed OK, they were a number of things  that made it so I won’t stay there again. My room was missing a chair to sit in, you could only sit on the bed or at the desk. The sheets didn’t stay on, the elastic was so old it wouldn’t hold them on. The air conditioning automatically went down during the night. When I went in the hot tub, I noticed that there was an old Band-Aid in the plant next to it. It was still there two days later. ",4,Heather,2025-10-04

"We really need a soft chair or 2 to relax in at the end of a long day. A single desk chair just does not work. Nor does sitting on the bed. There is definitely room for at least a side chair in the double Queen room. 
Also the exhaust fan in the bathroom was extremely loud. ",10,Verified traveler,2025-08-25

"Cons: Room was not entirely clean upon our arrival. Items on floor, hair in sheets to be used in the fold out bed. Property felt like it needed an upgrade. Room was dated, worn down. Both mornings we went for the breakfast and found everything had been wiped out (breakfast opened at 7:00, we were there around 7:30).  Pros: Beds were comfortable and staff was friendly. The area is extremely convenient and located within walking distance to food and shopping. ",8,Jennifer,2025-04-28

"Unsure who needs to know, but the morning of 3/30 at the Loveland CO branch, you had one young lady cooking breakfast for everyone. She was prompt, very sweet and had a smile on the entire time. She truly seemed very happy to be assisting everyone and her actions and manners did not go unnoticed. I wish I had gotten her name, but she needs to be teaching Customer Service to everyone not only in your company, but other places too. Not saying others for your Hotel were bad, but it’s just a breath of fresh air seeing how kind someone can be at work. Not acting like millions of others who are miserable while at their jobs.

"The room was advertised as having a pull out couch. And that I would fit four people. Although it was only two of us, the pullout couch would’ve only fit one. I have no idea how far people would ever fit in that room. The bed was awful absolutely awful and I did not have linens. It was 100% impossible to sleep on and made our experience horrible.Not good advertising, and I do expect money back.",2,Verified traveler,2025-01-20

"Rom 101 was spacious, bed was wonderful, amenities great.  The only negative is the light at night!  There is a very bright floodlight outside the window and the blackout curtains are too short … so light comes in right at your eye level while sleeping!

I am not a fan of having to put the trash liners into the trash cans when I arrive at a hotel. The first thing I did was blow my nose and has to try and set down the dirty tissue to put the trash liners in both trash cans. The other issue was that our refrigerator would not stay closed and that meant all our things were warm in the morning. We had to throw out items we intended to take on our trip. We were going to a funeral for a 26 year old young man and were already stressed. This just wasn't helping. ,6,Tricia,2024-07-25

"Check in was not super easy or quick despite doing the online check-in ahead of time. We were not aware there was a parking fee for this hotel, although we did create a Marriott Bonvoy account in order to get the free parking perk. Our room was a handicap accessible room, which I would not recommend or want to stay in again. It was on the main floor, and we did have upstairs neighbors stomping around quite a bit. The bathroom was less than ideal and had minimal counter space. I did not like the walk-in shower/bathroom combination. The tile and wall paper in the bathroom did not appear super clean or maintained. The door adjoining to the room next door had a huge gap at the bottom- we could see the light on underneath and felt that minimized privacy and comfort. There was also a light right above the window outside of our room that was on all night shining into our room even with the blinds closed. Overall we probably would not stay at this hotel again and definitely will be sure to avoid handicap accessible rooms in the future. ",6,Bethany,2024-03-30

The continental breakfast was terrible because at 7:30 in the morning they were out of most everything.  And sadly, this new trend of charging to park is ridiculous.

"Very clean, staff was very friendly and hotel was quiet.  Pool and hot tub were great. The surrounding area was an upscale shopping and dinning area. 

We would highly recommend anyone to stay here",10,James Wanda,2023-07-23

We were put in a handicap room and when you used the restroom the light was on the outside and it had a slide door.  Not very pleasing to room companions when using the restroom especially in the middle of the night. Walls are thin you can hear people in the next rooms or hallway very easily.  Some of the staff didn't seem like they wanted to be there. ,6,Bobbi,2023-07-16

"So sad at the experience, our room had repairs done in it, strong fumes, trash cans with no bags, overwhelming fumes from the epoxy repairs. Windows were open and fan was on the entire stay, called front desk, out bathroom lights didn't work and the door handle was loose. Overall very very sad at what was supposed to be our first vacation. ",2,Verified traveler,2023-06-17
Didn't like that when we booked it did not have all fees included.  Charging for parking is a JOKE. There was plenty of parking in area all around the hotel. Vacant buildings and lots. Also if you take a pet they do not list charges for pets.  All around not a good place to stay!,4,LAURIE,2023-06-14
The hotel was good with the exception that the AC ended up not working.  But the hotel manager was awesome to work with and went overboard to make sure we were moved and that our stay was great.  Really nice and professional staff!  ,8,Adam,2023-06-13

Clean and quiet. Rooms very clean and smell good. Quiet as nearby business offices seem vacant. Shopping and dining close by. Unfortunately Target is the only place to grab things one might need while traveling.,10,Edward,2023-05-20

The room and bathroom were a nice size and seemed cleaned. The a/c was a little loud when on. The property and room decor is updated. Breakfast was good and the staff was friendly. One thing I did not like was that they charged for parking unless you were a Marriott Bonvoy member. No reason too except to make extra money. ,8,Anamaria,2023-05-10

"The young lady that checked us in was very nice and made us feel welcomed!
The room was just as the picture showed in the description of the size with the two queen beds and pullout sofa.
Very nice sized room for the 4 of us to share.
The only negative thing about the room was the comfort of the sofa bed. Not good, and you could feel the springs through the very thin mattress. I would invest in nicer sleep sofas, as they do make some that are a better quality and comfort. Other than that it was a comfortable room!",10,kathleen,2023-04-03
