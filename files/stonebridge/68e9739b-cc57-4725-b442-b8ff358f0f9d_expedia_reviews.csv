"This was an excellent spot that did not charge for parking. Like we should ever be charged for parking when we’re paying $400 a night or more to stay in a beachfront hotel.
Super location really nice staff",10,Roberta,2025-10-06
Too much furniture is packed into a dirty room. The 2nd double bed actually blocks the sliding door. I do not recommend. Very disappointing.  The ocean view was spectacular.  That's the only good part.,4,Nina,2025-10-06
Nice view of the beach. Air conditioner was very noisy and old. It needs to be replaced. I mentioned that to the front seat and they agreed. So we slept with the sliding door to the balcony wide open and listened to the waves all night. Luckily the weather was nice. If it was hot out the A/C would have been unpleasant. We were suprised that there was no coffee maker in the room. I’ve never stayed in a hotel without a coffee maker especially for the price we paid. Location was good. Walk into town. ,6,Thomas,2025-10-05

"Overall, our stay was good and the hotel has a fantastic location. The front desk staff was super friendly and very accommodating, which made check-in and the overall experience pleasant. The keypad entry was a nice touch, as you didn’t have to worry about always having a key on hand.

That said, for the price paid, we expected the room itself to be a little nicer. The sliding screen door barely closed and the glass sliding door didn’t lock at all, which was concerning. The bathroom sink wouldn’t drain properly and the large 5-gallon pail under the AC unit on the balcony was not very appealing.

With some updates and attention to maintenance, this place could easily match the quality of its great staff and location.",8,Kayla,2025-09-23

Overall good stay in great location. View is beautiful but there could be more umbrellas by the pool area. It was hard to find shade. Also loud groups coming in very late yelling and slamming doors woke us up. Leans more towards younger crowd than families but still was a good stay given our last minute options. ,6,Jenny,2025-08-29

"Air conditioner was noisy and needed a bucket for all of the water it was throwing out on the deck.  Very small and cramped feeling small fridge couldn't open due to placement of bed, drapes didnt cover the sliding glass door fully.  could use an update.",8,Deborah,2025-08-20

"The property was wonderful! We were able to walk to the beach, while also seeing the beach from our rooms. The walk to town was very convenient. The hotel is absolutely adorable and I was hoping for this since it was just a mother 87yrs old and Daughter 46yrs old on this trip and the rooms, pool, comfort, towels couldn't have been any more perfect. My mother had the most amazing time and hasn't stopped smiling and talking about our hotel. Even the staff- very courteous, very helpful and just overal extremely nice. Especially the gentleman who was cleaning the grills on Monday evening. He was showing us how to use it,places to go and he was very funny. We had an amazing time. Thank you all so much!

The room was very nice.  All re-done and the view was perfect of the ocean. The staff was so accommodating.  I was hoping to get in a bit before check-in and the front desk actually called me to let me know my room was ready.  Definitely will be staying again. ,10,Alicia,2025-05-22

"We were extremely disappointed during our stay at Ocean Surf Resort. We’ve been visiting this property for 15 years and always looked forward coming back, especially with our two little boys. Ocean surf has always been a family like experience with families of small kids enjoying the pool laughing and enjoying themselves. our last visit was just two years ago, including my parents from out of state. our little boys have especially loved playing in the heated pool  splashing laughing jumping in the pool being very carefree. everyone so kid friendly smiling and embracing them. this time it was a very different experience. the culture there seemed cold toward families very few children only be mostly adults surrounding the property. as we entered the pool area my husband saw signs everywhere that you were not allowed to jump in the pool. which was something new to us. with  9 and 6 year old boys all they do is jump in the pool. on top of that our younger son is diagnosed with autism and that is one of his favorite things to do at home is jump in the pool. We knew that this interruption in his thought process would be impossible to enforce. We tried to talk with the office manager but was not accepting of our situation with a child with special needs. Basically our summer vacation was ruined. the biggest part of our trip was letting the boys swim. we had no choice but to leave. never in my life did i think i needed to call ahead and make sure that you were allowed to jump in pool",2,Rich,2024-07-19

"This is fairly basic motel.  Very expensive for what you get but then that’s all of Montauk in the summer. The main upside is that it’s right in the beach.  There’s a simple 
 but nice pool area too. There’s a nice cafe at the Marrin within walking distance as well as a super market.  Some nice restaurants al walking distance.  Staff were nice and helpful.  Main down side for us was old loud a/c unit that sometimes refused to turn off.  Also the room is small so the fridge is right next to your head.  When it turns on and off it makes a noise. We had some noisy neighbors but that’s always a risk.  Overall I’d say we would go back (and suck up the Montauk costs)",8,Brian,2024-06-24

Out of 6 nights 2 nights there was shooting of film happening most of the night and we could. Not sleep. They should have informed the guest and while this was happening parking was nightmare. We could not sleep due to lot of film shooting activities in the hotel. It ruined our whole break.,2,Asif,2023-09-23
"There are so many things to love about Ocean Surf Resort.  We had a spectacular view ocean front, only yards from the water, we heard the pounding waves all night, we could walk everywhere, including to Harvest on Fort Pond for a delicious dinner, and our accommodations were excellent.",8,Ruth,2023-09-21
"Last minute trip to Montauk with a Saturday night stay was crazy expensive…BUT, this place was clean, and literally a few steps from such a beautiful beach it was worth it. Does need some TLC. The AC was very loud and I told the front desk upon checking out. Close to everything downtown. Would stay again but book much further in advance and with the place directly. Very nice front desk staff. ",8,Adam,2023-08-21

"When I entered our room, my reaction was:” what the f…?!?!” We had paid $1900 for two nights ($950 per night) and found ourselves in a mediocre motel room. Pain was peeling down the walls and the bathroom one of these all plastic tin and wall. The balcony door wasn’t locking. The A/C (window style) was malfunctioning and the engine like noise was getting in every 5 min for 15 s and then off. On and off all night. I tried to sleep with earplugs and my husband with a mouse cancelling headphones. In the end we switched it off and the room be some really hot. Oh, and the “ocean side view”! A joke! Our balcony literally graced the other building but if you sat in the right angle you could see the ocean. The grills outside only worked with charcoal. Three positive notes (thank God!) : 1- the location. It’s literally in the beach and the beach is gorgeous, very natural and not too populated. 2- beds were comfortable. 3-there was a mini kitchen in the room and a fridge so we were able to cook (because montauk restaurants are also extremely expensive). As far as I’m concerned this was a total rip off but if you decide to go, make sure to book the rooms 26 and 28 with an actual view on the ocean. Will not be back. ",4,valerie,2023-08-01

"Rooms were not renovated and old. Bathroom was functional, but needs major improvements. The hote claims they have beach chairs and umbrellas but you have to grab them yourself and set them up. And they are all gone by 9am anyways. The pool loungers are all locked to the fence and can’t group together with my wife and kids. Kinda weird even for NY. ",6,neil,2023-07-10

"Liked that it was located right on the beach, staff were very friendly and nice. Did not like the mattresses. They were extremely uncomfortable and hard as cement. They really need to get more comfortable mattresses.",8,Carmen,2023-05-15
"The location is excellent, within walking distance of many shops and restaurants.
As to what we DIDN'T like: This is far from a ""resort""; the facility is old and in need of a facelift.  The balconies are covered in blue indoor/outdoor carpeting.  Our room was never cleaned after our first night.  When  we had to ask the front desk for more toilet paper, because we hadn't had any replaced from maid service, they had a snarky attitude.  When I told them our room hadn't been cleaned , they said ""we'll take care of it"".  By 2pm the next day our room hadn't been cleaned yet again.  When I complained, it was finally dealt with.  The coffee makers are old (not typical keurig machines).  Our original one was so clogged, it didn't push the water through the tubing.  After complaining, they brought us a new one.  
There is no direct beach access; you must walk up or down the block to get onto the beach.
