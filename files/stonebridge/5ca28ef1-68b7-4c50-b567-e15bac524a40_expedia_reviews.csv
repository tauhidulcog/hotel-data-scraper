"Excelente servicio, muy limpio y cómodo, el desayuno incluido  muy bien ",10,MIGUEL,2025-09-30
"Quiet and clean hotel, and room. My two dings against it are the showers, at least on the 6th floor, are short. Someone over 6' has to squat down to rinse his hair. The other is the beds absorb heat and/or air circulation is lousy. Both nights tossed and turned throughout and kept turning the temp down to get a cooling boost.",8,Chadwick,2025-09-30

Nice quiet and clean hotel. The staff was lovely and told you all you needed to know about your stay. ,10,Leah,2025-09-29
The room was clean. The bathroom was super small. You couldn’t open the door fully. When you open the door it would only partially open up against the shower doors. So you had to wedge yourself between the shower doors and the toilet to open and close the door. The mattress at one time was a pillow top. But was flat. The staff were super friendly and check in was great. But they charge you $12 a day for parking. ,6,James,2025-09-29
Great location and beautiful rooms lots of walkable resturants and shops nearby will definately stay here again if visiting the area.,10,Belinda,2025-09-28

"We enjoyed our stay, the place was clean and the rooms were spacious. It is also a great location but they charged $12 for parking which did surprise us, I guess I didn’t read the fine print. Breakfast was alright they had a variety of foods but 2 out 4 things I put on my plate were not good at all even my husband didn’t eat them.  ",8,Karen,2025-09-26
This property was very clean and comfortable large rooms.the only complaints I have are the shower and toilets were in the smallest bathroom possible.you couldn’t even get to the shower or toilet without some difficulty. The other was our room was outside the elevator which dinged 24/7. The breakfast and coffee were really fresh and good selection. I will definitely stay here again.,8,Dawn,2025-09-26

The room was nice with plenty of storage. The complaints would be first the bathroom set up. It was almost impossible to get out of the shower with the door open and I am a women of 140 lbs. The air conditioner was very loud which was annoying.,6,Philip,2025-09-21

"I recently visited the Denver area to shop at Park Meadows Mall.  This hotel is about 3 minutes away.  It was quiet, the bed was comfy, the breakfast had many choices, the staff was very friendly, and it was close to many restaurants.  There is even a bar in the evenings!  I'd definitely stay here again.",10,Jenness,2025-08-21

Very nice mall shopping and dining within walking distance. Staff very helpful and welcoming. Constructive feedback? Yes, include the parking in the reservations price rather than being surprised with it at check-in. Overall I’d definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. ",10,NILSA,2025-08-19

Very clean room. There is NO reasonable justification for a $12 outside parking fee-total rip. They put us next to the elevator and we should have asked for a change. ,8,Mike,2025-07-29

"Our room was clean however the vanity was non existent. When we used the sink at the vanity there was a pungent sulfur smell each and every time. We did let the front desk know but it wasn’t address during our stay. No channel guide on tv, front desk gave us a laminated guide after we asked. Didn’t meet expectations of a Hyatt property. ",6,Tanya,2025-07-27
"Hotel good quality , very clean, polite I thought great area. The bathroom has the worst design is seen. Like Everytime someone went in their you had to explain how to close the door. I also sometimes use a cane or other mobility aid I didn't need one this trip but if I needed a cane or anything this would have been totally a no the door almost hits the toilet.  The area was great food, the mall, shops and good a price. ",8,alissa,2025-07-27

"Very spacious and clean rooms. Free, full breakfast with great service. Gym is a bit small but definitely doable. Knocked down one star because my room was next to the elevator and was quite loud in the mornings.  ",8,Jennifer,2025-06-11
"The area was great, and the location is definitely a highlight. The room was spacious, and the beds were comfortable. The food was good overall. The restroom was just okay—nothing special. One issue I had was that the hallway often smelled like marijuana. At one point, the smell was coming into my room, and I had to call the front desk to report it. This was especially concerning since I had kids with me.

There was also a loud dog barking in the room next to mine, which was disruptive. I requested housekeeping in the morning before leaving for the day, but when I returned around 5:30 PM, they were just starting to clean the room. Additionally, the sofa bed sheets were dirty upon arrival, so make sure to check those if you’re using it.

Despite these issues, it’s an okay place to stay overall, and the great location helps make up for some of the drawbacks.",6,Alondra,2025-06-11

"For a family on a road trip this is a great option, room was large (although the bathroom is ridiculously small, the door basically brushes the toilet) pool was a welcome break after a 10 hour flight and breakfast was convenient and good. Cookies on arrival is a lovely touch but as with many hotels they are charging £10 to park. There are little to no public transportation options where these hotels are located you have to drive there, it’s not a built up city such as NY or DC that has limited space you are literally surrounded by space and yet they charge for parking. We nearly always try to utilise the Hyatt brand, for a family of 6 they offer great rooms but the parking charges are unreasonable. ",8,Jonathan,2025-04-15

"The first night our a/c unit didn't work.  We had tried a couple different times before calling down to the front desk.  At 12:00 a.m., I finally decided to call since the room temp was now 74º and climbing.  The girl at the front desk told me to shut the unit off and just wait because it was cooling off outside so it would eventually cool the room down.  Well, needless to say, after each of took a shower, the room was now at 78º.  My husband went down to the front desk to complain and they decided to move us to a new room at 1:00 a.m.

We were staying for 5 days so the posted notice said that we would get a ""light"" cleaning on day 3.  This didn't happen, even though we did NOT have the ""do not bother"" sign hanging on our door.  We called the front desk again after returning that evening from the hospital to complain and they finally agreed to deliver fresh towels to the room and take our trash out.  We finally got the room cleaned on our last day, which was kind of pointless at that point.  

Everything was clean, but there was just a few issues that I wish we didn't have to deal with.  It's very frustrating when you pay around $150 each night and then things are not up to the best standards.  ",6,Stacy,2025-03-12

The staff was nice and accommodating and the free breakfast in the morning was good with several different options that changed each day. Room was very spacious for a standard room. The only complaint to be had is the bathroom layout is very restrictive in terms of space.

"The listing states there are laundry facilities. After traveling 4 days of an 8 day trip, that was one of the main reasons for booking this location-that and the proximity to the interstate.  Upon arrival- after checking in, I asked where the laundry facilities are and the clerk said it was a translation error and they only offered dry cleaning services. I showed him the listing on Expedia and he said I could go to their other facility and use their washer and dryer (13 miles away mind you). He was rude and more interested in his secondary job as the bartender. Needless to say- it was a huge inconvenience and we had to get up early the next morning to find a laundromat.

There is a limitation on room service were informed of that the stairwell had a eaten broken up sandwich pieces all over the stairs, so you had to watch where you walked, there was a pair of dirty underwear laying by the elevator when we went to ask about the lack of room service front desk person was very lackadaisical about it and lastly, my daughters rooms.

The room was quiet, freshly updated, and comfortable. no issues with shower temperature or water pressure. Breakfast had a variety of hot food, cereal, breads, yogurt...the usual fare.

"The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly.  The reason for the 3 stars is the parking/towing situation. I am fine to pay for parking, but to put out signs warning you that your trip could be ruined if your car gets towed, lets me know this is a management problem.  I am not sure what the overall problem is, but people who pay to stay at hotels also need a place to park... pretty simple. Fix the parking situation, and people will gladly come stay at your hotel. The parking lot is isolated and had ample parking spots, seems like their should be an easy solution here. ",6,Jacob,2024-07-12
"The clerks were friendly. The counter/ bartender was great. The dinner we had was not very good, especially in a Hyatt Hotel. The bottom half of the buns were stale. We expected the food to be better. The breakfast was eh, OK. I reserved a top floor king room, which is what I paid for, and got a lower floor King room. The bathroom must have been renovated. The bathroom door was too wide for the space. We had to sqeeze in between toilet and wall for the door to open and close. Otherwise, the bed was comfortable,  but the a/c unit was very noisy, which had a wall switch because the unit switch didn't work.",6,Andre,2024-07-12

The weird thing in the room was the bathroom.  The sink was outside and you had to go next to the toilet to shut the door.  That part of the room didnt make sense.  The breakfast was okay.

Didn’t like that they charge for parking! Even though they have their own parking lot as do all the restaurants and shopping around the hotel.

Didn’t like that the cream/half & half for the coffee comes in little tiny packets where you have to open like 10 of them to get any amount. Why not just place a container of half & half near the coffee.",4,Paul,2024-06-02
They’ll charge you for parking. They warned us that they were testing the fire alarms the day after we checked in. We left our room before testing began only to come back to another sign saying they’ll be testing the fire alarms again the next day. Not restful. The dining area is not large enough to accommodate guests. Was not inspired to stay here again.  ,6,LIVIA,2024-06-02
"Everything was pretty good, except the walls seem to be a bit thin. We were also by the elevators, so that could've been why. Also surprisingly, no hot tub, & you have to pay for parking. But other than that, it was a nice stay. Nice rooms, and breakfast.",8,Verified traveler,2024-06-01
"No Luggage trolleys at all - none at arrival, none in the morning, we waited for many hours. Told us, people had taken them - whole night in their rooms and even longer?
The staff did not care...
Well, but this was just a minor problem  - we never had it at any hotel.

When we found out by checking in into  our room  this was right above some big airconditon turbines outside, we asked for another room - explaining the problem,
a quiet one please - because we can't sleep with the noise of these steadily running machines. So they gave us a room to the other side. When we went to bed we thought a truck outside under our window, 2nd floor, did not cut off its engine - so I got up and dressed again and I went down and out to see which car makes this noise. There were 2 well hidden aircon machines or whatever right at the outside wall under our window! I talked to the receptionist but she said she cannot do anything and the hotel needs the supply. 
How stupid is this hotel staff? We told them the reason
for our room changing and they put us right over a similar machine? Revenge? Or do these people not know the place they are working in and its facilities? Or they just don't care...
We had chosen this hotel because we always like to stay in suites with much space for me and my husband and a lot of luggage traveling around for some weeks.
This was a bad experience - we didn't get much sleep that night - ear plugs didn't help!

Never ever again!

When we got back in our room we tried to go back to sleep but the fire alarm was still blinking.  Went down stairs and told the front desk about the lights blinking and she had no idea they were doing that.  They finally got the fire alarm light turned off at about 8:15 but by that time we were wide awake and couldn’t continue to sleep.  No apologies or refunds for at least that one night.

"First of all, the parking was terrible because the spots were so small that you could barely fit a SUV in. My family and I returned to the room after getting some food and the fire alarms went off. We proceeded cautiously through the stairway to make it outside. We stood in the cold for 30 minutes. The fire department never came, but upon going back into the hotel we found out that they had been having false alarms all week. The staff offered no resolution or comfort to this incident. My family and I went to the pool. Upon returning to our room, I went to grab towels for us to take showers. My family went in the elevator ahead me and got to sixth floor where our room was and couldn't get out the elevator. There was some door blocking the exit. They tried pushing it but it did not work so they had to go all the way back down to lobby. They got lucky on catching the other elevator in order to get back to the room. When we complained about it the staff just said you should have just pushed the door open.However, when my family tried to push the door open it would not open. I would not recommend that place to anyone even my worst enemy. It makes me sad because I like Hyatts.",2,Rodriguez,2024-04-22

"The night staff was the friendliest I have ever had anywhere I have stayed.  She went above and beyond for the customers, was very polite, and was also very patient. I would recommend this place for anyone and their families or even anyone who needs a place for a business trip.  
I would like to say that the day staff was also very nice and accommodating as well.  Not as personable, but that is to be expected as they are super busy.  But they are so welcoming and cheerful.  Just a wonderful place.",10,Tammy,2024-04-08

Front desk was very helpful, the rooms were very clean, everything was great the only disappointment thing was the bathroom on the 5th floor in my room it was very small couldn't open the bathroom door all the way cuz it was getting stopped by the shower had to squeeze in a small area by the toilet but overall this place is amazing",10,Verified traveler,2024-04-03

"They have a policy to not clean rooms (or even empty trash cans etc) until after the third day… we were staying with our whole family in one room- plenty of beds, but dorm size trash cans don’t cut it for that long!  Staff was not very helpful.  We had occasion to ask several questions, but their “easy to use communication option” of texting took HOURS to get a response.  Breakfast was dismal and both days it was left with empty serving dishes instead of decent food choices.  Overall the room was great… that’s about all I can say as a positive review.",6,Jennifer,2024-03-28
"Love the large room. Plenty of room and sleeping options for a family of four to stretch out. There's even room for a small dining table, which would be the only thing I would add! I enjoy the sink being outside of the restroom as it allows flexibility of use and reduces wait time. Pool area was nice and clean. Haven't had breakfast yet, but the 24 hr Starbucks on site seems like a nice perk 😊 We will definitely make this out Denver staycation hotel",10,Krista,2024-03-28

"The bathroom sink is right in the bedroom. So if you stay with someone you hear them wash their hands after using the restroom in the middle of the night. Also they say they have Starbucks but no one was there to make one. The breakfast area was 4-5 tables at the most. With over 100 rooms there was no where to sit for breakfast unless you want to eat in your room holding your plate. If you stay on the first floor, the Ice machine is on 3rd floor. Just small things that most wouldn’t be bothered by. But to us these matter as we travel quite a bit. ",6,DANYIKA,2024-03-11

No hot water for the shower at night or pressure but then the morning there was, very strange. It felt like a $50 hotel which was definitely not what we paid obviously. Staff was very nice though, just felt like a waste for as much as they charge their pictures have a lot of false advertising as well. Very simple out dated hotel.",6,Verified traveler,2023-12-23

"I have been staying at this hotel regularly for years (Seriously, my first stay here was in 2010).  It recently received a very nice refresh.  The staff is always very friendly, the breakfast is decent, if basic.  The location can't be beat for food and shopping.  However, they recently added a parking fee.  Not much, certainly nothing compared to downtown Denver, but this is a residential, mall area.  All the parking around it is free.  None of the signage indicated a fee for a parking pass and why would I look for a parking fee in the small print after years and years of no fee? Silly, I know, but I find it a disappointing money grab.  ",6,Michelle,2023-12-12

"The bathroom is not super clean, and it is tough to enter and leave. It's tiny, and the door keeps in the way.
The mattress was terrible. It's super soft, like a cheap mattress. 
The breakfast could have been better. Cold scrambled eggs, greasy sausage, super starched potatoes. The juices were also bad. Shortage of forks and other silverware. 
The hotel lobby and rooms are ok. 
They also charge you $5 for parking in a giant open space that shares a parking lot with Red Lobster—no point in paying for this. Service was okay.
A Starbucks is inside the hotel, but the shelves are empty, and no one is there. Looks like a ghost place.
One more thing. We stayed in front of the elevator, so if you got this bad luck, be prepared to hear the loud chimes every time and lose your sleep the whole night.",6,Verified traveler,2023-10-10

"Hyatt always has nice properties but the staff were particularly nice, everything smelled so clean,  the breakfast was quite good and shopping is in walking distance (the reason i selected) but what prompted me to write a review was the lovely little dog area. Most hotels dont provide one or it is a little plot of dirt. While this isnt fenced there is a nice bench, two trees with their large roots showing through the ample grass and an area behind for a small walk, if so inclined.

"Checked in after 1am due to a late night flight which was delayed, and was told my reservation was cancelled…I pre paid for my 2 night stay. What angered me was that I called a day before my flight seeing if there was a check-in cutoff time, was told there was none and person on the phone said they’ll leave a note of my late arrival…no note was left and I had to plea with the front desk person to reinstate my reservation…luckily he was able to but overall a terrible thing to deal with after a long day traveling. Also, paid $5 per day for parking and there was no spot for me to park. Asked the front desk what to do and they said I could park in the street but couldn’t guarantee it wouldn’t be towed.  Several other people had the same issue. Why charge for parking if a spot isn’t guaranteed. Overall, the staff was not well trained in hospitality and the parking operation need improvement.

"The hotel was in the middle of renovations, so it was maybe not the best time to stay here. Only one of the elevators was working at the time, which made for sometimes long wait times to get up to our room. The breakfast area was a bit of a mess due to its temporary setup. After a not-so-pleasing breakfast experience the first morning, we ended up eating elsewhere for the remainder of our stay. The room was nice and spacious, but the fridge was so tiny we couldn't store any food in there (which makes no sense for a suite-style hotel). The bed was uncomfortable (way too soft). The door to the bathroom didn't quite clear the toilet so you have to use a bit of force to push it past it. The bathroom was also kind of small and awkward to try to move around in. There was no housekeeping service at all during our three-night stay, which we were not informed of during check-in. There might have been information about that somewhere else that we missed, though. Also, it's kind of strange for a suite-style hotel to not have on-site laundry, but we were able to find a laundromat somewhere else so that wasn't a big issue. Overall we had a pretty good stay, but I would imagine it would have been more pleasant with housekeeping and without the construction.",8,Verified traveler,2023-08-20

"We didn’t know that the entire lobby was under construction.   We had to drive to the back of the hotel and check in entering a door, which appeared to be to a small conference room, on the back of the hotel. The staff was young, not professionally dressed, in jeans, didn’t see a name tag.  Things to purchase like water and snacks were pilled on a table behind them. The breakfast are was assembled in this room also. 

One working elevator for the entire hotel. Painters, uneven flooring, yellow caution tape everywhere.  

This wasn’t shown on either the Expedia or the actual hotel website. We had 3 small children with us and would NEVER have booked this hotel if we had known the conditions were so poor.",4,Gina,2023-08-18
"Under construction. Walked around to the back of the parking lot and through the back door and followed the hall to find the temporary check in desk. Was told they stop working at 5, but some workers still at it after 8. We loved the location for what we needed. Room was clean. We did hear highway traffic but to be expected. We didn’t make it down for breakfast so can’t review on that. Still waiting on the receipt. I would stay here again if I’m in the area and I would recommend.",8,Jennifer,2023-08-16
"Lobby was under construction and I was personally not notified during booking process or beforehand.

In my opinion the bedding was uncomfortable and I would wake up in the night with the fitted sheet somehow off the corners. The AC was also loud in our room.

Only one (slow) elevator was available for our stay.

House keeping did not come to take out trash a single time for our five night stay.

Water was not available on one of the days as well at all.",4,Verified traveler,2023-08-16
The room’s itself were good but the property was under construction and usually the hotels find a better way around it but this was bad there was saw dust coming into the elevators and the front desk was in this other room to the side.

Unfortunate that their alternate entrance/exit walkway was uneven just outside the door and I fell, doing damage to my knee.  Price was good, was it a renovation price? ",8,Helen,2023-07-23

"I stayed here post surgery and booked a room for handicap. It was not ADA compliant, there were lips on the floor where i had to lift my walker to get to and from the bathroom. They also didnt notify us that they were going through a remodel so construction was active and loud. I would have booked a different hotel if i had known. The front entrance was closed for construction so I had to walk in the back. ",2,Kimberly,2023-07-20
Horrible experience!! No big signs saying where the entrance was. Just Horrible having to deal with the contructuction. The staff tried their best but so unorganized ,2,Melisa,2023-07-20
The bathroom is inexcusably small. Climb on toilet to shut door. No individual servings of drinks… out of a pitcher…will not return. What happened to the huge rooms Hyatt Place introduced in the 90s??,4,William,2023-07-19

They didn’t tell us they were renovating. There was no lobby and the rooms weren’t ready at check in. They sent us away and didn’t call to tell us when they were actually ready. We wandered the mall with and came back to find out they were ready and no one called us to tell us. It was noisy and the restaurant nearby was having construction done at night so it was everywhere. Not relaxing at all. Very disappointing. The city was booked due to Taylor swift concert so we couldn’t change places even if we tried. ,4,Angela,2023-07-19

We also booked a room with 2 beds and a pullout but we were called by the hotel a bit later saying they didn’t have that room available. They only had a king bed and pullout. We booked non refundable, so we just had to take that room, even though it wasn’t great for our family. I wish we would have booked a different motel. ",6,Katie,2023-07-14

Our room was not very clean, needed to be mopped as the floors were dirty, gnats in the shower, hair on the toilet. The room itself was really nice if it had been properly cleaned. Area was great.

I know there is construction going on but we didn’t hear anything going on during our stay.

It's going through major construction. Using hammer drills on the walls of the room next to you and you couldn't hear yourself talk. Had a 7 month old with me and it was scaring her.

"My family and I stayed at the Hyatt Place Denver South/Park Meadows for three nights.  The hotel is undergoing some renovations which did not bother us as we did not hear anything.  Only one elevator was working and it looked like the renovations hadn't caught up to the elevator yet.  The room was spacious and clean.  The bath and toilet room was very small, but clean.

There were a few things that were either not working (microwave) or empty (coffee) and it was still early in the morning and no one was working to restock.

"Bathroom was TINY. 
Didn’t get the king bedroom that I booked. 
Elevator was gross with dirt. Looked CHEAP with zip ties keeping the paneling on, the carpet was ripped up. 
Breakfast was sad. Waffles and eggs were cold- and we had to eat with the most flimsy plasticware I’ve ever used. Garbage was way overdue for a change. A manager walked by and asked me how the breakfast was, I said “it’s….okay”, she stared at me for a few seconds and just walked away. 
The lighting was so low in the whole room that I couldn’t do my makeup. 
I stay in hotels at least 2x a month for work, and this was the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in in 10 yrs. 
I almost never leave a bad review, but this place away horrible.

"We stayed 3 nights and the staff was absolutely incredible. From check-in to check-out they were service-oriented, kind, and willing to help if we ever needed anything. We travel a lot, and that portion of our stay definitely stood out.

The hotel is currently under a big remodel. We were in one of the remodeled rooms and our other family members were in the older rooms which were still really nice. They apologized that we might hear renovating noises but we never did.

It was located right near the Park Meadows Mall which we enjoyed visiting.

The breakfast was simple but anyone that ever complains about free reflects more on them. There was still a good variety with some hot foods (eggs, ham/sausage, potatoes, tortillas, waffles/french toast), common cold cereals, orange and apple juice, hot chocolate/coffee, and oatmeal packet options.

We also enjoyed the cookies and hot chocolate that welcomed us as we entered the hotel each day.",10,Rodney,2023-03-28

They are under construction! I wish I was made aware of this before I booked 5 days! I have 5 kids and there were days we needed to sleep in or stay into the afternoon to rest and you could hear the banging and drilling as if it was in the next room (even though it wasn’t). When I mentioned it to the staff they said every room in the hotel can hear it just the same. I doubt it. But okay. Breakfast was good but it closed too early (at 9am) and it was too crowded. ,4,Megan,2023-03-18

However Hyatt Place Denver South/Park Meadows did nothing for us other than change our room and give us points (only 1/6th the cost of a room). We had to spend the next day at the laundromat running our clothes through the dryer on high. They did give us Hyatt points for our inconvenience. I have too much paranoia now to stay with Hyatt again though, so they are useless and not even enough to get anything with.
