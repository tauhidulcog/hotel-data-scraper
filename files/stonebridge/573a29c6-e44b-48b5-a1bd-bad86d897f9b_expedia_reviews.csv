Clean room,8,Josh,2025-09-25
"Had a handicap room and it was hard to use bathroom with no vanity. Tissue box on a stand 10 feet away. Also duvet had a hole in it and had seen better days. It was clean, though, and from be for one night",6,Karen,2025-09-24
"The people at the front desk were wonderful.  The young man who greeted us worked us through the registration in a timely manner even though neither my wife for I are good with phones.

The chef and his assistants were great.  They accepted compliments graciously.  When we needed to check out 30 minutes before they opened on Monday morning they let us go in the serving area an grab what we needed before other guests were allowed in.

Why does Hilton charge a parking fee when Holiday Inn next door just includes that in their nightly charge?  I guess I could have parked next door at the Home Depot for freee.",10,Gary,2025-09-24
The TV would not turn on. The bathroom door was hard to open and close and the shower curtain rod was pulled down to the point that it would not let the curtain stay closed and caused leaking onto the bathroom floor.  I was also not informed of having to pay for parking.,6,Jessica,2025-09-23
"Property needs complete refurbishing.  Rooms look and feel old and outdated.  Bathroom cabinets are chipped quite terribly.  Bathroom did not seem clean.
Come on Hilton, invest a little in your properties.",10,David,2025-09-22

It was a good location and nice staff but the room did not smell good. It had a damp moldy smell ,8,Rachel,2025-09-09
Property was in declining repair. The bed was worn out and the linens were not to Hampton standards. The room was very perfumed with cleaning product. ,6,Donald,2025-09-07

"Very nice and friendly staff. A short drive to everywhere we wanted to go, including Red Rocks Amphitheater. A solid 2 1/2 star hotel. Very clean! Very comfortable bed. I would stay again",10,Tamara,2025-09-04
Billy at the front desk was fantastic! He was funny and personable! The breakfast staff was so nice too! The room was clean and beautiful. My daughters loved the way it was decorated. The pool was nice and warm and the hot tub jets were super strong. ,10,Amanda,2025-09-04
Awful noise coming from linen room other than that very nice facility. Awesome breakfast!,6,Doug,2025-09-02

,6,Concepcion,2025-09-01
Very clean room. But the sink faucet needed repair and there was no place to put your bathroom amenities. There was no cleaning service between our two night stay and no liners in the trash cans. On top of that we had to pay for parking when the parking was full. We walked from the next hotel the first night.,4,Julie,2025-09-01
"Hotel was clean and well maintained. The staff was professional and friendly. The complimentary breakfast was excellent, included hot food items as well as the usual waffles, fruit, etc. Beverages available in the lobby. The only thing we noticed was a musty smell in the room ",10,Julia,2025-08-31

,4,Norbert,2025-08-22
"I've never been in such a noisy hotel.  First, you put me in room 216, over the entrance, so I could hear the lobby doors rumbling open and close every time, along with a noisy AC unit.  Then, when I asked to move to a quieter room, you put me in 201 next to something that also rumbled frequently.   The breakfast was the same every day.  Not a great experience.",4,Norbert,2025-08-22
"Had a small group of 2 families same last names and upon checking in, the front desk checked them in switched with prepay and pay upon checkin. Difference in cost and charges, pet involved.",8,Dennis,2025-08-21
The top cover of the bed didn’t look clean.    The toilet wouldn’t stop running.   The bed wasn’t very comfortable ,6,Amy,2025-08-18

Great place to stay. Staff very friendly.,10,Sheryl,2025-07-25
"Not happy with the bathroom door style. Im in construction but its stupid when they're installed wrong, but the fact it leaves a huge gap is crazy. Shade was broken also so couldn't open or close it. Little stuff you expect to work when you stay for three days. Breakfast was cold and coffee burnt my mouth.",8,Patrick M,2025-07-24
The room had an Oder. Asked to change rooms but the other rooms had the same Oder.,6,James A,2025-07-24

"La humedad qué avía en el cuarto no dejaba descansar además es muy ruidoso, pensé que contaria con una cama extraible pero NO solo es un sofá, fue una desepcion total. ",6,Iris,2025-07-07

"Very comfortable. For some reason, the room became a little humid, but it was still cool and not hot. We would stay there again!",10,Lynda,2025-07-03
Billy the manager took exceptional care of an A/C issue we were having in our room. Thanks again Billy.,8,Doug,2025-06-30
"If you are going to Red Rocks, this is convenient. But, other than that, this place is in desperate need of a renovation. Very run down, dirty carpets, doors to rooms are warped and hard to shut. Hot tub and pool areas are run down.",4,Valerie,2025-06-27
"Convenient to our venue (Red Rocks), clean and with a very comfortable bed.",10,Lisa,2025-06-24
Nice location,8,MICHAEL,2025-06-22
It was clean,10,Jon,2025-06-22
Staff was kind and helpful but the sink had zero counter space and we were told that cleaning happens every three days unless requested. Th fridge in our room was so loud when cooling that we had to unplug it.,4,Presley,2025-06-21
,10,timothy,2025-06-19
Overall our stay was comfortable. The two issues were we had to pay for parking which was a surprise to me at check in and there was mold on the ceiling above the shower. The staff was friendly and overall our stay was fine. We chose this hotel because we were attending a concert at Red Rocks and it was very easy to get to and from the venue. ,6,Verified traveler,2025-06-18

"Very clean hotel could use a little updating, but overall very very nice. Would stay here again.",10,Karen,2025-06-15
,8,Rex,2025-06-14
It’s fine. Nothing special. I would not step a big toe in the pool or hot tub. They looked very murky. Sheets wouldn’t stay on the bed - they must have recently got new mattresses but not upgraded the sheets that fit properly. Beds were nice minus the sheets.  Bathtub was stained and a little dingy. Breakfast was fine - typical American microwaved fare with sub par coffee. Expensive for what you get. ,6,Cathy,2025-06-09
Very nice hotel! Would stay at again! ,10,Brianne,2025-06-08
"Very efficient check in, room quiet and spotless ",10,Michael,2025-05-30
"I’m usually a huge fan but the first room that we were given had a lot of black material in the bathroom sink.  They did move us to second room, which had a handle on a cabinet door that had a missing screw.  That wasn’t horrible, but a little surprising.",8,Carolyn,2025-05-28
,2,Andrew,2025-05-28
"The hotel was very clean and comfortable and the staff was most friendly. The area was accessible to stores, dining and Red Rocks Amphitheater. We'd stay there again in a heartbeat!",10,Janice,2025-05-25
"The staff was friendly.  However, the pool was freezing cold and the hot tub definitely needed some attention. The hot tub had a very green tint to it and when the jets were turned on there was a strong moldy smell. The bathroom also had mildew on the ceiling. It certainly may be time for some maintenance. ",8,Sheila,2025-05-25
"When we opened the door to the room they assigned us; we saw a couple of suitcases, fortunately the owners of the luggage weren’t there, or just getting out of the shower. Very bad.",2,Christian,2025-05-24

We arrived and were told that one of our rooms had been cancelled by the Hampton Inn staff for no apparent reason.  We had booked a handicapped accessible room for my mother months in advance and the room had a bathtub.  The whole reason for booking a handicapped room was to have a walk in shower.  If you're handicapped you can't step over a bathtub. As a result  she was unable to take a shower while at the property for three nights-unacceptable. ,4,Lisa,2025-05-14

I got to the hotel they said I was a day early I showed them the confirmation email showing Thursday to Sunday and they said nope it shows Friday through Sunday so I checked my card and was charged for Thursday through Sunday and my email shows the same but they made me pay again to add Thursday even tho the confirmation email said I already paid so I had to pay twice just to get a room,6,Devin,2025-04-28

"How can they charge $8 per night just to park a car? It's outrageous. And they still have the gall to call you an ""Honors Member."" And if the car is vandalized, they won't accept any responsibility. This is late-stage capitalism.
I will be actively avoiding this chain from now on.",4,Mauricio,2025-04-23

"This was a quick stopover on a road trip. The hotel was fine, the person at the front desk was friendly and helpful. It was very busy and there was a lot of noise at night from the pool, but our room was right above it and it was open until midnight, so if it had been in another location we may not have noticed.",6,Elizabeth,2025-04-01

"Property was clean but had obvious need for repairs. The sink in our room was cracked and seemed to have been that way for a long time.

We stayed at two different Hampton Inns during out week and a half long travel. We also stayed at Air BnB properties and other hotels Hampton Inn was the most consistent in terms of quality and cleanliness. We really liked this property and plan on staying again in the future.,10,Sonya,2025-03-25

The guests upstairs were running laps on Christmas. I called the front desk to complain and they did not offer a remedy. The noise continued through the night putting my pet on edge. The next morning the woman at the front desk proceeded to lie to my face claiming there was nobody staying in any of the rooms around us. She also informed me that unfortunately because I booked via Expedia I was not allowed a refund for my terrible stay. ,2,Christopher,2025-01-02

"It is in a location where the $8.00/day parking charge is not necessary. They charged my credit card $8.00 for parking (I flew to Denver and used Ubers, no car. Unacceptable mistake!)",8,William,2024-11-08
"The front desk staff made all the other issues, not a big problem. The room had a bathroom that was poorly designed and needed updating the tub needed to be reglazed. We needed more garbage cans. A second chair in the corner would have been helpful as there was only one for two people, not garbage cans. The toilet paper roll was behind the toilet rather than at the side and finally, the refrigerator wasn’t working at first and we were asked to check it on a different plug. It worked half the night and then stopped. We plugged it in again and it worked then it stopped , so every day we would unplug it and replug it in to get our water and milk cold.  So there’s probably a short. Not sending somebody up should have been an issue.",10,Patricia,2024-11-05

"We arrived at 3 PM to check in. We stood at the front desk for almost 10 minutes before someone came to help us. The facility was nice. Rooms clean bed comfortable. But it was noisy all night and when you looked out our window, we are right up against the wall. When checking out they asked how our stay was. I said it was noisy. All night sounded like something was rolling across our ceiling back-and-forth. There was no attempt of service recovery",6,Tina,2024-10-28

"We waited two hours to get the room because it “wasn’t ready”. The room smelled strange but we decided we could live with it until we went to shower this morning and found traces of what looked like whoever started here last had thrown up in the shower stall. And thanks to Expedia’s booking, we were shorted 1 room of the three we paid for and a second room because the hotel double booked it. Never again",2,Joan,2024-09-14

"We liked the hotel, and the staff was extremely helpful and kind.  The room we had was directly behind the porte cochere so there was no view.  The hotel is also dated.

"Nice, affordable hotel close to Red Rocks. The room and bathroom was a little weird in it's layout/decor but the bed was really comfy.

Horrible high pitched alarm going off from door by front desk the entire time we were there. No one seemed interested in turning it off. Front desk staff admitted they were suffering. Left the clear impression no one in leadership cared. My presumption is they are too old to hear the high pitched whistle alarm. Very painful. Couldn’t even eat breakfast.,6,Geoffrey,2024-08-11

"For the price, the room was not clean or in good functioning order. There were dark handprints all over the bathroom walls, there was an opened sucker on the tv stand, and the drain in the sink and shower were slow and didn’t work well. Nobody comes to clean and freshen up rooms any more. Rooms are higher priced with zero service. I expect way more from a Hampton Inn. ",6,Jenny,2024-08-10

We booked a king bed, couch, and the sink had a vanity style. We got a double bed, no couch and the sink had no vanity so it was very challenging for a family.

I’m not sure if it was Hotels.com or the hotels fault that this happened but this truly made it a very difficult sleeping situation for our family with our kids.",2,Emma,2024-03-14

"Comfortable and good sized room. Excellent breakfast selections. Nearby pizza place was great, also.",10,Beth,2024-01-23
"The whole reason I booked this stay was to enjoy the hot tub and have a room with a tub.
The hot tub's cleanliness was vile! And I am disgusted I even made the mistake of getting in! The bubbles were going when I stepped in.. When my friend and I got in we immediately got itchy, hopped out and turned off the Harsh Jets to revel scummy gross water... So it wasn't burning us from chlorine it was burning from too much acid (i.e pee!) I'm beyond disturbed. We immediately went to the room to rinse off only to find the bathroom in even worse conditions! There was hair from a previous guest All Over the shower, and the amenities cady. There was foamy suds as I wrinsed down someone else's PUBIC HAIR.. And I didn't really feel comfortable taking a Bath either, as I previously had planned. 
In my opinion this completely ruined my trip. Not too mention the breakfast sucked and the sheets smelled weird. Also, Diego was Less than accommodating when I complained about the hot tub and the shower cleanliness, and didn't even offer to move us rooms. Though Sarah in the morning was lovely and Mario who checked me in was nice, my overall experience was terrible!
Again, I would have gone to a hot spring and not here but decided to come stay at this hotel instead because of the tub and hot tub. This was an EPIC FAIL.",2,Alaina,2024-01-22

"The hot tub is likely growing something in the jets— It smells like a combination of staph and pseudomonas when the jets are on.

Nice breakfast. We were in back by a door so it was noisy for us.,8,G.,2023-04-11

"Our garbage piled up inside our room for four days and we ask for towels a couple of times, and only got them on our final day of the stay when I went down in person.
We tried to borrow a crib for our one year old and they gave us a crib that had no bottom. It was just a metal frame.
The front desk staff seemed like they were in high school, and generally untrained and apathetic",4,Marshall,2023-03-14

"Fresh cucumber and citrus water in lobby, along with hot water for tea and cocoa and coffee available. Good breakfast and clean breakfast area. 

Friendly staff and clean rooms and very cozy room. We had the fortunate availability to have a view of the Rocky Mountains from a distance. Very nice hotel. ",10,Jessica,2023-03-08

Price was good. Room clean. Breakfast and coffee was good. Exactly what we needed for a good night rest.,8,Shawn,2023-02-12
It was nice for the price.  It could probably use a little updating but the bathroom was nice & up to date.  Not a lot of light in room if you wanted to read..,10,Vicki,2023-02-11
"When my price quote was given via hotels.com website, there was ZERO notice of an $8/day additional charge for on-site, outdoor, non-secure self-parking.  I only found out when I checked in.  I feel cheated by the way it was handled - and I feel the room rate is not accurately reflecting this cost.  This hotel is in a suburban area near shopping centers - not in an area typical of fee parking.  ",6,Susan,2023-02-10

"I blame ownership and senior management:  One woman only on front desk at peak check-in hours.  Overstressed, short tempered, angry, rude.  Not ALL her fault, as she was managing an impossible workload.

No outdoor space for dog business.",4,Frederick,2023-01-08
The beds here are so comfortable! And breakfast was great. Great find for the money. ,8,Joshua,2023-01-05
