"Overall, the room was lovely. There was plenty of space in our Junior Suite however, we were in a handicap accessible room and the shower had a sprayer on a handle in addition to the shower head, which was great except once you switch the water to the shower head, it was almost impossible to get it back to the handle. It seemed as though the shower was missing a component. ",8,Sarah,2024-08-13

This was a great stay. We loved the convenience of the airport shuttle. The rooms were clean and comfy. The only problem was that we booked rooms with 2 queen beds through Expedia but the hotel didn’t see that on their end and they assigned us to a king bed room. Luckily the desk staff were able to make the switch since they still had a room with 2 queen beds available. ,10,Shyla,2024-06-02

In room Heat alternated between blaze hot and cold.  Shower had intermittent “warm” water.  Door to bathroom was broken or off track.  Room was questionably clean.  This place smells like burnt bacon… maybe I’m crabby from no sleep but not the enjoyable night of rest I hoped for staff was nice and lobby is lovely.  There is a nice bar.,4,Sabrina,2024-03-16

"Hotel clerk seemed pissed to even be there. She was not friendly in any way. She was short and abrupt. I asked about the parking, we’ve stayed here many times to fly out. The app is new, since we just flew out in September and it wasn’t used then. She acted like I should have known about it. And then didn’t bother to tell me to wait until the morning to start it. We also stayed there in June and she’s been there each of these three times. She is always the same. There have been two gentlemen there also, these guys were great! She needs to take notes from them and learn how to treat customers. ",6,Denise,2024-02-13

"The “press 1 for shuttle information” operation said to wait for the “white bus” with the “gateway hotels” sign in the side. It is spares to run at the top and bottom of every hour. After waiting an hour in the freezing, and by freezing, I made “FREEZING!!!” cold, I called the hotel to find out the buts was black with no labels!😡😡😡 The bus driver tools me that off ask their bags, they have only one that is white. This is unacceptable! Everything else was OK but for the fact that the heater in the room was while inadequate. It just couldn’t heat it up much. I had to run it full-tilt to get it even somewhat warm enough to inhabit that room.",2,Andrew,2023-01-13
