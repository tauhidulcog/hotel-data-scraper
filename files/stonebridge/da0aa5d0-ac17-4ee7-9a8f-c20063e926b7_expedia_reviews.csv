"Toilet was jammed, service team haven’t closed our room after cleaning, so we came back to the room full of our stuff with the door staring open for half a day. Service was bad, staff are not knowledgeable neither friendly. At the checkout they couldn’t split out bill in two, only one payment station was working… no apologies or refunds at the end of this awful experience ",2,Tatyana,2025-10-06
"Aspetti positivi: Ottima location per muoversi a piedi nelle zone più belle di NY. 
Camera double double bella e molto spaziosa per gli standard di Manhattan. Letto comodo bagno grande e funzionale. Forse rivedrei l'illuminazione...davvero scarsa soprattutto per il make up. 
La cameriera del nostro piano (il 7) era davvero bravissima. 
Aspetti negativi: 
Le aree comuni non sono granché. 
La sera gli ascensori sono in condivisione con un club sul rooftop e questo comporta a volte lunghe attese. 
Nel complesso è un hotel che consiglierei. ",8,ALFREDO,2025-09-27
"The view from the room is amazing up on the high floors. The room is very comfortable. Cons: there is a bar on the 39th floor that goes untim 4am and is veru loud with dance music. But if you have white noise you wont hear it. Also when I was there the gym was a hot mess, buckets everywhere filled with water , I guess they had a leak. Could not work out the machines were affected by it. The staff was all very friendly and caring. ",8,Rinat,2025-09-22

"Awful. I was at this property in August and the air conditioning in my room was broken and the room stayed hot, humid and smelling of must. I notified the front desk Vincent who assured me maintenance would resolve the issue. When I returned later that evening the room was still hot. Again I went to the front desk, spoke with Jason who stated there were no other rooms available and maintenance would fix the air. Maintenance came could not fix the air, said the rooms were without air conditioning as well. Maintenance guy brought up a noisy fan with a sound decibel like a jet engine. Was informed by hotel manager Kim that I need to request a refund through Expedia. Absurd experience ",2,Laura,2025-08-31

"Nous avons passé 6 jours à l’hôtel Renaissance Chelsea, et nous avons été séduits par le service et le charme des chambres avec une vue dégagée sur la skyline.

"Nice 4-star hotel in the heart of Chelsea. We stayed for 5 nights in a King Corner Room with a city view — the room was relatively spacious by NYC standards and the view didn’t disappoint. A solid choice for a longer stay. The hotel also features a great rooftop bar, perfect for relaxing after a day out in the city or for clubbing in the evening. ",10,Anders,2025-06-05

"A really disappointing stay. We were downgraded on our first night. The room smelt like very strong smoke, the air con rattled all night and the bed sheets and pillows had a really bad smell. 

Breakfast at the hotel was honestly one of the worst I’ve experienced. $35 and extremely limited choice. Very small dining area and the service was very poor. 

Reception staff were mostly rude, not very welcoming, and any issue we had was met with a very blank uninterested expression. 

We had to ask daily for our room to be cleaned/ towels changed. Very annoying if you’ve been out all day and then return to a your hotel room with no clean towels or bed made.

"Not what I expected from Renaissance, but not entirely bad, either.  Would have liked a bigger bar area, as this hotel’s bar was small, cramped, and under-staffed.  One bartender for an entire hotel the week after Christmas was not enough.  But there wasn’t room for much more, either.  Still in all, a good place to get some sleep and get out and see NYC.

"The hotel is situated in a good area, and the staff always had a smile on their faces. We stayed on the 22nd floor, where it was pleasantly quiet with no loud music. However, there were a couple of downsides. The shower did not have an exhaust fan, which made it feel suffocating in the small room. Additionally, the handheld shower pipe had a hole and was leaking. Overall, while the room was small—something we expected in New York.",6,Kavya,2025-01-06
"o hotel arruinou minhas férias de fim de ano
É com profunda decepção que escrevo este review sobre minha estadia de 14 dias. O que era para ser um período de descanso e lazer se transformou em uma experiência estressante e desagradável devido a uma série de erros inadmissíveis por parte do estabelecimento.
Logo no terceiro dia de hospedagem, fui surpreendido com a troca do meu quarto sem qualquer aviso prévio. Para piorar a situação, meus pertences, incluindo roupas que ainda não haviam sido guardadas na mala, foram simplesmente transferidos para outro quarto em sacos de lixo, demonstrando total descaso com meus bens e minha privacidade. O novo quarto, além de estar completamente bagunçado, era de categoria diferente ao que eu havia reservado e pago, configurando um claro descumprimento do contrato.
Para completar o absurdo, itens pessoais foram perdidos durante essa mudança indevida, o que me causou grande transtorno e prejuízo. A falta de cuidado e respeito com a qual meus pertences foram tratados é simplesmente inaceitável.
Apesar de ter reclamado formalmente sobre o ocorrido, o hotel demorou quatro longos dias para oferecer qualquer tipo de compensação. A solução apresentada se limitou a abonar as taxas de turismo, o que considero insuficiente diante da gravidade dos erros cometidos.
É lamentável que um estabelecimento que se propõe a oferecer hospedagem e conforto aos seus hóspedes aja com tamanho descaso e amadorismo. Minha estadia foi marcada por estresse e frustração",2,Luiz Augusto,2025-01-06

The hotel is attached to a nightclub and people who were not staying at the hotel were allowed to go anywhere they wanted as there is no security on the premises. On our last day the AC broke and our room was registering 78 degrees. Maintenance came several times and as we later learned the HVAC wasn’t working and upper management knew about it and didn’t go anything about it. There was one man at the front desk that was having to deal with everything by himself but didn’t have the resources to be able to do anything. We will not be staying here again.,2,Mireya,2024-12-30

Nice hotel in a very good location.  The elevators are really slow.  Complimentary water is a nice touch as there is a plentiful supply.  You will spend a lot of time waiting on elevators and as long as you are patient and not in a rush then you should be fine. Heat in our room did not work 1st day but was fixed.,8,Eric,2024-12-13
"Beautiful!  Comfortable!  Great customer service.  The maintenance mechanic actually introduced himself and was so friendly! 
",10,Dawn,2024-12-09
"Some key things to know about this property. First, there is a nightclub on the top floor, so if you want to sleep well, ask for a lower floor. 

Also, the rooms are small but well designed. 

The bathroom doors are actual doors with hinges and a handle. They don’t have the barn doors that are so terribly annoying these days.

There are not enough elevators to service this hotel properly and there can be long elevator lines which is especially problematic during thehours of 4 PM and 8 PM.


There are no do not disturb door hangers so the excellent cleaning staff will loudly knock on your door at 9 AM. It would be great if they could provide do not disturb signs so that we were allowed to sleep in on vacation.

The pillows they use are very nice but are super super squishy so I needed multiple to feel like I had any support. I had to ask three times for the pillows but they did send them and we’re very kind once they did.

It’s a crazy weekend Manhattan so we paid the rate of 879 a night, which feels like too high for this hotel. There’s no special quality of service, so while it’s a nice hotel, it’s more of a 495 or under a hotel, not a 875. I feel like the value for the money wasn’t there.

As with so many hotels, they appear to turn off the air-conditioning or fan in the middle of the night, so if you’re like me, you will wake up at 3 AM I wonder why it’s so hot!


And finally, I feel like they should have a lighted make up or magnifying mirror on an arm in the bathroom.

The property is clean and tidy. Rooms were tiny but New York is the playground! 
We were on the 32nd floor and we were able to hear the booms and bass of the nightclub, I can’t imaging how horrible it would’ve been on the lower floors. 
 I recommend to get the city view room, waking up and going to bed to the Empire State Building was amazing!

"When I got back to my room in the evening, I realized that the curtains were tied all the way at the top and there was no way for me to close them. Since it was late, I didn't want to have to call and wait for housekeeping but why was it tied in the first place? 
 
Also when I checked in, they did not mention the resort fee and what it could be used towards. Other properties generally welcome you as a Marriott Bonvoy customer, but nothing here. I spoke to the same person when I was checking out (to report the curtain issue above); she did apologize but it felt very scripted and cold. Maybe she was overwhelmed, maybe it's her personality but I expected better from this property. ",8,Leena,2024-09-28

"We've stayed in many hotesl around the world and in New York itself. Renaissance Chelsea is definately one of the top 5. The room, the location of the hotel, the services, the staff, the check in and check out. 

There are so many good things to write about. It was so easy getting around, walking distance to Times Square, Macy's, Empire State and also such good connections to the underground/Metro.

We were here celebrating after our 16 year old daughters tough year with GCSE's. She absolutely loved it too, so happy child means happy parents.

There are several restaurants and stores within walking distance. They have a rooftop lounge but it’s not owned by the hotel. So, you have to pay extra to enter. They have a restaurant but it’s hours are tricky because they’re not open during certain times. The staff wasn’t always accommodating or friendly during my 4 day stay.

Chambre très jolie au 34ème étage avec vue époustouflante sur tout Manhattan! WC superbe avec douche formidable! Par contre peut d’espace rangement dans la chambre.
Situation fâcheuse : $30 nous ont été facturé en arrivant & nous sommes obligés de les dépenser dans l’hotel avant de partir; ce que je ne trouve pas correcte. Heureusement mon mari prend le petit déjeuner le matin et à pu les dépenser; si non ils étaient non-remboursables !😡
Aussi, sur le  site il est affiché qu’il y a une piscine et Spa, ce qui est faut. Au 38 & 39ème étages il y a bien une piscine, mais ça appartient à un lounge « Somewhere Nowhere » avec accès séparé à l’extérieur de l’hôtel & qui coûte $100 pour y accéder; le soir où nous étions là, il y avait une soirée privée, donc pas de baignade, même pas à $100!😳",10,Verena,2024-07-19
I love this hotel they have a cute little bar and restaurant and it was a great area and it was a great place to stay. If you get around a different places we walked to a lot of places love New York. I love this hotel.,10,Cynthia,2024-07-19

"Beautiful hotel and room, would have given 5 stars had valley been better. To charge $85 for vallet less than a 100 yards from the hotel and then to have to wait over an hour for my car to be brought over is ridiculous. Either the hotel accepts poor quality service from the parking garage or is not doing a good job making sure they perform just as good as the hotel.
Paying $85 even for NYC is very high to have to wait over an hour for my vehicle. ",10,Verified traveler,2024-07-15

"Great location. Nice sizeable rooms with good views (we were on the 31st). Hotel has all the amenities.
Only downsides were the limited number of elevators for its size and the common areas being pretty unkempt (used delivery boxes piling up, there was an entry coffee cup sitting on the front desk as we checked in and no one cared, cleaning supplies sitting in the hallways when not used…) - we’ll chalk it up to probable understaffing.",10,Dino,2024-07-07

"The last night we were there we didn't have any water due to them doing some type of maintenance. We were told they notified guests by putting up fliers but we did not see any fliers posted anywhere and were in and out of the hotel 2-3 times a day so if they did I feel like we would've seen them. We couldn't shower, use the restroom, or wash our hands. When the water did come back on in the morning, we didnt have any hot water so I had to take a cold shower. The AC wasn't working either. The thermostat would be set at 65 but it was 75 and humid in our room. We were miserable. It felt better outside than in our room.",4,Charlene,2024-07-03

"A smart and very comfortable hotel in a perfect location two blocks from the subway. The decor is lovely and the staff friendly. Our room was a good size and the breakfast was excellent, if a little pricey. The only minuses were the rather slow lifts and the some shortcomings in the room. Functionality has been sacrificed for style here. There is a lack of storage space, not a single drawer and the one tiny closet was unlit and not tall enough to hang a dress. There were no shelves in the bathroom and the shower is controlled by one tap for both flow and temperature so it takes an age adjusting by tiny to increments to get it comfortable. Also I would have expected a room fridge for $300 a day. Would I come here again? Yes, with these minor gripes noted.",8,Graeme,2024-06-20

Kamer was netjes en werd elke dag schoongemaakt en aangevuld. Bedden waren prima. Niet heel breed. Redelijk genoeg ruimte voor NY begrippen. Alleen niet genoeg ruimte voor iedereen zijn kleding. Maar de kids leefden voornamelijk uit hun koffer. Helaas geen klein koelkastje. Douche was prima. Alleen de handdouche hing er een beetje zielig bij en de kop had ook wel wat onderhoud nodig. En het licht van de badkamer deed ook raar. We hebben geen gebruik gemaakt van het restaurant. Wel van de bar en personeel was heel vriendelijk en wijn lekker. Ook fijn dat je elke dag flesjes water kon krijgen. Al met al hebben we een fijne ervaring gehad. Ondanks dat we niet veel in het hotel waren. 😊,8,Jolanda,2024-05-05

"Had a really good stay here with my husband and son. We shared a double room on the fourth floor. On that floor in particular there are really high ceilings which adds the illusion of more space to what would otherwise be a small room. The beds were comfortable, but not very soft, and street noises were pretty loud on the lower floor, so I did wake up easily throughout the night. There wasn’t a lot of space for us to store clothes, just a small closet and two drawers but that was alright since the boys lived out of their suitcase. The tv was a good size and we were able to log into our Netflix. 
The lobby bar was great, staff was helpful, we had a really good time. We didn’t try the breakfast or dinner at the hotel but we grabbed coffee at the bar in the morning which was extra but still very convenient. Mini water bottles were also available in the lobby 24/7 for no extra charge. ",10,brooke,2024-04-08

Small in the loby bar was fine, did not try the restaurant. Limited interaction with staff but they were friendly. Biggest complaint is there is a nightclub attached and we were brushed aside / held back by a security guard while trying to get on the elevator to our room so they could let a group from the club on.

"Fabulous hotel with a great location. A few things. We were offered a corner room with a view and took it.  Great view but the location makes the room/bathroom smaller making it a little close for 2 people to move around. The heat was not fully working in the room even after maintenance ""fixed"" it. At check I informed the hotel and they kindly took $200 off our total bill.  Other than that we enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Comfortable bed. wonderful shower.  Great lobby and bar with free snacks and space to lounge with a drink. Nice covered area outside the hotel with heaters to relax. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Can't beat the hotel location for enjoying and exploring the city.  We will definitely stay at this hotel on our next visit to New York.  ",8,Kenneth,2023-12-05

"Customer service is the responsibility of the customer. A week prior to arrival I reduced the number of nights from 4 to 3. I also change the name of one of the guests of one of the rooms. In total, I had two rooms booked. While it was confirmed to me that the changes have been made, upon checking in it became apparent that only the reduction of the nights had occurred for one of the rooms. The person on the front desk required that I make a telephone call. In order to clarify this mistake after spending more than 30 minutes sitting in reception dealing with a chat bot of hotels.com and then them themselves having to call the hotel, the situation was finally resolved. I did not feel at all welcome. 

Although only one of the rooms was ready when we arrived at 3pm and the situation with the extra night had not been clarified, the gentleman on reception still went ahead and deducted the costs for all nights from my credit card without explaining anything about the charges. Also not explained was anything to do with the facilities in the hotel or the breakfast, which I found out about two days later. During my entire stay, I did not see the cleaning lady once except the one time she did try to come to my room at about 5 pm. Which is honestly far too late to be cleaning your room. Considering I have just left another Marriot two days before where they had charged me for the rooms twice, I have to say my recent experience of Marriott has not been very good at all.",6,Matthew,2023-10-23

We had read that there was waits for the elevator from there being a club on the rooftop but we had no issues with that at all and we were there on a Saturday in august so I wouldn’t let that turn you away. Everything was perfect the staff were more than friendly and accommodating. It’s a two minute walk to fifth avenue where all the shopping is, lots of great dining it was a 10/10 experience for us.

This is a very cozy upscale hotel with beautiful views of above. Most certainly a place to stay for a staycation. The staff friendly the drinks were made with precision and love. Who could ask for more. ,10,Kwesi,2023-05-15
"This property was central to many restaurants, stores and attractions!",8,Kassanndra,2023-05-13
"I really wanted to like this place and will say that the property itself is beautiful and well kept. That being said, we weren’t able to fully enjoy the hotel as we were kicked out of the lobby the moment one of us sat down down as we were waiting for our Uber. There was no explanation from the security, just that we weren’t allowed to sit down and needed to wait outside. It was 1:30am so I assumed that the lobby was closed except there were other guests using the lobby with no problems. We were extremely embarrassed and uncomfortable after that and didn’t want to use the facilities or ask for housekeeping. It truly tainted our experience. Upon checking out, we learned that there were no lobby hours. When we told them what had happened, they said it was probably assumed that we had just come from their rooftop bar instead of being guests. I told them that they should change their protocol to ask instead of assume. It definitely didn’t feel good to know that based on our appearance, we couldn’t even be afforded to be asked if we were guests prior to being kicked out.",4,Samantha,2023-05-09

Hotellets faciliteter er ikke til at bruge de var lukket og der skal special tilladelse til for at kunne bruge dem. Så reelt er dette et middelklasse hotel bare til voædsom overpris,6,mikael,2023-04-29

"The hotel is very nice and clean. Booking through hotels.com I got an extra 20% off which was great. I ended up spending less than the holiday inn express was charging! The room was a great size and very clean. Housekeeping was fantastic! On mornings where we wanted to sleep in they actually came back at a later time without us having to ask. We’d get back in the evening and our stuff would be picked up, beds made, and fresh towels. I’d say the housekeeping was the best part about the hotel! The beds were comfortable, shower was clean and nice. The location was great, plenty of shops/dining around. Checking out was easy and the doorman/valet had a cab already waiting for guests so we got to head to the airport immediately. Now to the cons. The rooftop lounge was annoying. The crowd, the fact that two elevators were designated to the roof in the evening, and sometimes the people working the elevators/front door were rude to hotel guests (sorry we’re not all young beautiful women like the ones going to the bar). We had to wait in line to go up to our room multiple times due to the elevator issue which isn’t ideal with a kid in the evening. Some nights it was a little noisy, but it didn’t really bother us. Overall, we were happy with the stay. The rooftop lounge is the main thing that we didn’t like about the hotel. Wish it had a completely different entrance and elevator. ",8,Michael,2023-04-11

Fantastic staff and great rooms,10,Timothy,2023-04-09
The Renaissance is a lovely chic hotel in a great part of mid town. It’s a brief walk to the subway. The rooms are stylish but quite small. Tough for four people- but wouldn’t be a problem for two. The staff was fabulous and kind.  The place has a cool vibe to it for sure. ,8,Sharon,2023-04-05
"The Staff was really friendly, the hotel was beautiful and so was my room, and view! The food and drinks from the restaurant in the hotel was so good! I stayed on the 35th floor. No complaints, the nightclub noise didn't bother me.",10,Rosanny,2023-04-03

"The Renaissance is conveniently located in Chelsea and stylishly furnished, but that's about it. Upon check-in, they gave us keys to somebody else's room (security protocols need a thorough review, I guess). It turns out a corner room, as booked, was not available so they downgraded us to a standard room for the first night (the price difference was credited, but we had to change rooms the following day, which was inconvenient). No bath foam in the room, only shampoo and a bar of soap (I had not seen one in 4**** hotels in a long time!). Bathrobes only on request, no slippers at all. In-room dining is performed by an external catering service which, upon a request for afternoon tea and biscuits, invited us to check the 24-hour deli at the corner of the street (and they thought they were being helpful). You want drinking water? Poor you. No mini bar in the room, the lobby bar does not sell water. Options? Tiny bottles handed out by reception staff, or vending machines in the basement... speechless. On a final note, if you're planning to book because of the stunning views from the rooftop bar & club, look elsewhere. The rooftop is run by a third party and hotel guests have no privileged access whatsoever to the premises. As a matter of fact, they are invited to join the streetside queue, in the freezing cold and with the general public. At 350+ USD/day, I would not come back to this Hotel.",4,Alessandro,2023-03-22

"It was a great hotel to stay at! We were there for 5 nights. The staff was so friendly and helpful each day. The hotel is beautifully decorated and clean. Also it is in a great location. Short walk to the metro, restaurants, and stores. The view from our room was perfect! Every night we had the amazing NYC scenery twinkling back at us with the Empire State building taking main stage. We will for sure be back in the future and recommend Renaissance NY Chelsea Hotel to all our friends and family. ",10,Amanda,2023-03-07

Hotel was clean and quiet. All staff was super friendly. House keeping came by every morning to service room. Hotel is in a convenient location walking distance to a lot of shops and subways. Fire alarm did go off in the middle of the night but other than that stay was great. ,10,Nora,2023-01-09

"In general we have been good in the hotel, perfect location, new hotel, excellent bathroom, some some limitation on the shower drainage. On the improving side, for a family of 4, as we were, I don’t recommend it as we had 3 big baggage’s with no enough space, just one 40 cm width closet, sure not big enough, we had to buy shower soap because there just bar of soap and shampoo, no fridge on the room, first night we were awake twice at 2:00am and 4:00am for a fire false alarm, it’s happens.
