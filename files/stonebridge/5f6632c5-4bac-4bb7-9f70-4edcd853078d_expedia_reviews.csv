The place overall location wise is great. The room is tiny with barely any space to move around. The bed was uncomfortable and the shower went from cold to nuclear hot. Also the sound on the floor was terrible. Every door close sounded like a slam reversing through the hallways. On my first night all I heard was a maintenance person clanging around fixing something in the hallway till after midnight. I’ve stayed in the area many times before in neighboring hotels and I have to say I wouldn’t come back. ,4,Tom,2025-09-26

"This property my fiance and I stayed in. It was a good experience because they had everything around the property, from Nightclub, to eating at night. Morning time, it was the same, a variety of everything. ",8,Steven,2025-09-22
I loved everything about this hotel besides not having a mini fridge or an ice machine.  Next time I am bringing my cooler backpack and going down the road to get a block of ice.  Besides that the rooms were very comfortable and modern with beautiful rooftop lounging to have a nice cup of coffee with a view in the morning.  Definitely recommend.,10,Robert,2025-09-21
The room and TV was very small but clean. The phone looked like it needs to be disinfected but overall it was decent. Staff was friendly. ,8,Alitha,2025-09-20

"If you have ever stayed in New York, you know that most hotels, boutique or not, have small rooms. When we first arrived, the room we had originally was tiny, and we asked if we could be moved to a different one.

The staff worked with us and didn't charge us extra for a better room with a little more space. The staff in general was very accommodating and easy to work with.

That being said, overall, I would give my stay a 7.5 out of 10 based on the following: Location, Staff, Comfort, and Cleanliness.

My negatives would have to be that there was no fridge to store food, the ironing board was a small board that had to be used on a surface, and the TV didn't always work; sometimes it did, sometimes it didn't.

I was there for fashion week with my wife, so it was central to the places we needed to work at during the trip. I wouldn't necessarily stay at this hotel purely for vacation purposes, but to be in the same area for a reasonable price, I wouldn't mind coming back to this hotel.

This hotel is perfect for exploring NYC for a true New Yorker experience. Staff were amazing and the hotel room we booked was amazing ! Had a perfect city sky line very for great sunsets and amazing night life views. Parking isn’t ideal ( but that’s an nyc problem ) we will be booking again for our next NYC trip in a few months again ! ,10,Wilson,2025-09-12
Fabulous Hotel. Great views of the city. Modest but wonderful.,10,Denise,2025-09-12
For the spot this hotel is in and how nice the rooms are (plus an awesome view) this hotel is crazy affordable. Yes obviously it’s small you are  in NYC lol. 10/10 will be coming back to this hotel every time I stay in nyc ,10,Adam,2025-09-06
This place was not at all what I expeted. The room was in bad condition. The bathroom lights were out and some was flickering. Just a generally low codition hotel.,4,Verified traveler,2025-09-05

"It was located in the lower side. It was a good price excellent views I have no complaints. It’s probably pretty basic but I don’t need a fancy hotel because my whole goal is to hang around in the city and it’s definitely way better than a lot of hotels, I’ve been to in New York.",10,James,2025-07-21
"The front desk staff was incredible. The room is very bare and quite dingy. The curtains were stained, stains and marks on the walls too. Seemed clean and the bed was comfy with a lot of pillows. It’s extremely noisy on the third floor from street noise. I didn’t mind, but I used to live in NYC so I was used to it.",6,Verified traveler,2025-07-19

"The AC in the room didn't work. The phone and lamp by bed weren't plugged in. There was a staff member who was very new, not his fault, but seemed to be only one there and he tried to fix their AC system by resetting it but it didn't work--and it was super hot. We had to open all windows for a breeze, but the area is incredibly noisy on a weekend. I asked the one staff where a nearby bodega or cornerstore was and he said he didn't know the area. Oh and they have no ive machine in the entire hotel. Would never stay there again, unless it were maybe $50 and just for one night.",4,Erik,2025-07-07

"This was my first stay at this Hotel, due to NYU graduation, it was the only vacancy in my preferred area.  
The staff was very accommodating, fresh coffee is always available and the rooms have nice newer flooring.  
It is a 2 star hotel and was adequate but I would try for another option before using again. The mattress was low quality and provided limited back support, there was little in the way of sound proofing so bring ear plugs to deaden exterior and adjacent room and hall noise.  The window/blind provided zero sound proofing from sidewalk/road noise (I was on fourth floor). Cleaning was adequate, it felt clean but corners were slightly dusty. 
The shower took 8-10 minutes to warm up and had low pressure, so turn the hot water on well in advance if using.
The single double bed room is sufficient for 1 person with a carry on, much more and the room is tight.  
Overall, the hotel is probably fine for people not needing bed support and looking to partake in the bar scene. Earplugs help unless you have an early flight and need to hear the alarm. ",6,Stacie,2025-05-17

The location of this hotel is amazing. Right in the heart of the city and it is very easy to get around to other parts of NY. The water at the hotel was cold. That ruined it for us because usually you can not wait to get back to the hotel to shower. Even after letting it run for 15-20 minutes the water remained the same temperature. You can also hear everything from outside the room to even the inside of people’s rooms while I was in my own. The staff was super sweet and very helpful and attentive. ,6,Pamela,2025-05-08

"This is the most extraordinary value hotel in the most extraordinary part of Manhattan - the Lower East Side.  Surrounded by cool galleries, boutiques, Chinatown, amazing restaurants and quiet coffee shops, this location couldn't be better.  BUT, what really makes this place shine is the view.  While the rooms are simple, I was on the top floor (11th - ask for it) and I had massive, expansive views of the city skyline on two sides of my room.

Gave a guest with us an upgrade however gave them an upgrade better than what I paid for so that seemed a little out of host etiquette! And for no other reason than just to do it I guess!

"There is no hot water at this hotel. After running the shower for 10 minutes and only getting freezing water in October, we went to call the front desk but our phone did not work. When we went down to say we had no hot water, the receptionist said that they are an ""eco-friendly hotel"" and to run it for 20 minutes to get hot water. We ended up running the shower for 30 minutes and could only get room temperature water. There is also a resort fee that ""includes bottled water"", however we did not have any bottled water in our room. Our bathroom was not cleaned well before we checked in and there was hair in the shower. The location is nice but the experience was not worth it. ",4,Lydia,2024-10-11

Then got into my room and noticed the AC didnt work because it was like 90 degrees in the room.  I told the front desk person (who at this point seemed annoyed at me for asking for ice) and she told me there were no open rooms and that it was too late in the evening to get it fixed and then just stared at me.  I had to convince her to move me to a different hotel with a room with working AC.  ",2,Adam,2024-10-07
"While the location was in a trendy neighborhood, the noise factor was terrible as our room faced the street and it was unbelievably loud well past 3am; a room situated right nearby the elevator was also problematic. The room itself was extraordinary small, but that is to be expected in NYC. The staff were accommodating.",6,Richard Marc,2024-10-06

"We had a poor experience during check-in. Check-in time was supposed to be 3PM. However, when we got there, we were told our room wasn't ready and it'd be a couple of minutes. Those ""couple of minutes"" turned into an 75 min. We were there on vacation and had places to go, and the hotel's disorganization impacted our plans. The receptionist said the delay was due to us having booked a city view room on a high floor, and that they clean rooms from bottom to top floors. Hardly an excuse, since we were paying for a ""better"" room. At 45 min past check-in, I asked if we could get a downgraded room and just check in, but they could not help. No additional accomodations were made for us. I would not recommend staying at this hotel. ",4,Toru,2024-09-08

"We got to the hotel at 12am but due to over booking we didn’t get into a room until 2am. Upon arrival at the Orchard Street Hotel, it had a very foul, spoiled smell. There was some issues with overbooking and they only had one worker so we were standing there until 2am before we finally spoke up to be serviced since he was waiting on other clients. When we finally got our room key we tried to enter but someone had already occupied the room. We were then asked to stay at a partner hotel due to the unavailability. This room was in a completely different hotel on top of that. When we got to our “new hotel” which happened to be the Redford Hotel the room had a very weird smell. We tried to requests a different room but due to it being the only room left we were unable to get a different one. The space was extremely small. It was literally just a place to sleep and didn’t come with anything. The rooms do not seem to be thoroughly cleaned as when we came in and inspected there was a dead bug near the trash. If you plan on being out a lot and don’t care about where you sleep this will work. I know i was really uncomfortable and a little disappointed but i don’t think i would recommend or stay again.

The shower was broken and we had no hot water. They moved us to room 302. This room had a broken sink that sprayed everywhere but at least we had hot water in the shower after running it for 10 minutes. We had to wash our hands in the shower to avoid getting sprayed by the sink. The hallways all had ripped wallpaper and our room wallpaper in 302 had body fluids on it. Would not stay here again.

The room was tiny, but clean and quiet and perfect for sound sleeping. The AC worked great. However, the shower water barely attained lukewarm and the coffee was vile, totally unacceptable for a NYC hotel. I’d forgotten how hip and grungy that part of the LES is, so it was nice to stroll by Arlene’s Grocery and up and down Ludlow. I slept well in a clean, comfortable bed, and that was what I most needed.",4,John,2024-08-07
"This was a horrible experience- they tack on fees for WiFi and amenities (but the WiFi doesn’t even work).

"I enjoyed my stay overall. Due to the lack of cleanliness in the bathroom, there was hair in the shower, behind the toilet and around the toilet it was grimy, way too much hair from someone else in the room.

"I live in NYC and work in the neighborhood the hotel is in, so I am very familiar with the area and thought it would be a fun booking. I sometimes book a weekend somewhere just to have a ""staycation"" - and this experience was so bad I didn't even stay the second night I booked, rather I opted to just go home. Why? Because the shower in the room had ZERO hot water and very close to zero water pressure. After taking an ice cold trickle shower Saturday night, I found the towels to be dirty as well. Absolutely gross, they smelled faintly of mildew. So I did my best to enjoy my evening, and tried to get some sleep. Which is near impossible if you're close to the ground floor facing Orchard Street. I know the area is loud, but I did expect the building to have a little bit of sound proofing because of that. So I got up early and went home to take a hot shower with fresh towels, and decided not to return even though I booked two days.

I would absolutely recommend against this booking at all costs. It would have to be the last available room in the city for me to ever consider it again - and even then I'd probably book in an outer borough first.",2,Isaac,2023-06-05

Views from our high floor room were awesome. Staff were a bit unprofessional and flustered each time I saw a guest come and go. (A little eye contact and a smile go a long way). Overall good stay in a great location. Remember to call to ask about parking deal with a nearby lot which ended up costing only  around 1/4 what I would have paid. ",8,Seth,2023-04-30

"This is not the place to stay in NYC.  I book hotels all over the country and this is my first bad experience.

I booked two rooms for my employees here.  Between the two of them, they experienced no hot water when trying to shower, a broken elevator which forced them to walk u several flights of stairs, and a gross lack of customer service.  

One of my employees was asleep in the morning, when housekeeping opened the door and came right in.  They were shocked to see the room still occupied, saying ""the manager told us you checked out last night"" when nothing of the sort was true.  That left her feeling nervous and upset, wondering who else would come in unannounced.

Take your money elsewhere - where hot water is plentiful, elevators run properly, and managers don't misinform the staff.",2,Verified traveler,2023-04-29

"I have never wrote a review about anything, simply because I'm lazy. However, this hotel experience was sooo bad, even with the fact that my checkout was a week ago (Dec 30th), that it motivated me to write one. 
I arrived SEVERAL hours after the check-in time and when I entered the room, I was greeted with the bathroom's sink in the hallway (NOT in the bathroom). This isn't an issue the front desk could fix, but it surely wasn't mentioned or advertised in Expedia's photos of them room. Secondly, I only had body towels and no wash cloths/hand towels/etc. Thirdly, my bed sheets were dirty. The design of the room was just awful! No wall paintings , and no lamps on the night stands (so you'd have to get up from bed to turn off all lights). You couldn't move around the bed without hitting your shins because the bed was so close to the walls. Lastly, the height of the bed was weirdly low.. like your mattress is on the floor. 

The only positive experience I had with this hotel was with the staff. They gave me extra sheets, recommended food spots and etc. I will say the ""kicker"" is when given the new sheets I had to be the one to change the bed. Had housekeeping or whomever did their job in the first place there would be no need for new sheets. Secondly, customers don't pay all that money for their stay to fix their own bedsheets. Overall, I've stayed in many hotels in my lifestyle and NEVER EVER have I had such a disgusting experience. I do not recommend. ",4,sabrina,2023-01-04
