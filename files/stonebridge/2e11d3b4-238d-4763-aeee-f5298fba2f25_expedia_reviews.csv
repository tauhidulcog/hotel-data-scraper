The room was beautiful.  Booking with hotels.com is very horrible experience i had 2 times in 1 week.  Do not trust there advertisement its not what it is in pictures.   ,2,Joann,2025-10-03
"Although the price was a great deal and included breakfast and close to parks, the cleanliness of the facility was not good. Our room had stained sheets and towels, the toilet never flush properly, leaving us to either flush multiple times or unclog it ourselves, the shower was dirty when we got there, along with both the showerheads corroded. Hotel team and safety was great, but If the hotel was cleaned, I would stay here again, but due to cleanliness, I will not. ",6,Brittany M,2025-10-03
"My family and I enjoyed this hotel. It was our first time staying here. Great service, updated hotel, free breakfast and great amenities in the hotel and the area. Quick update by text if needed by staff which made it easier instead of calling for anything we need. We will keep this hotel for next time we stay again. Thank you ",10,Ernest John,2025-09-30

Free breakfast and they have a close by bus shuttle to go to Disney but you have to pay $6 a day which is not too bad,8,Joji,2025-09-25
"Alright place, could be better with how much you pay, especially parking not being included nor disclosed unless at the bottom of the website in fine print. Just be aware of the security deposit is for parking in there parking lot. When arrived we got told they needed to hold a security deposit of $150 and would get reimbursed what was not used from the the little shop they have, nothing about parking was told would be taken out of the security deposit, we would have found free parking, especially with how much we already spent on the hotel, and our first trip to Disneyland.. Called and to discuss what the charge was for got told 25$ a night plus tax for parking was taken out of the deposit, all the representatives could say was it was stated at the bottom of the website I asked why it wasnt discussed when told about needing a security deposit. Just a little disappointing with how much our trip was then to see that charge. Just That much for parking and not to even get a guaranteed parking spot or a spot near the entrance to the hotel.

"Everything was excellent, except I needed to ask the front desk for earplugs because I could not sleep at all without them from the surrounding noise. Disney noise is to be expected like the fireworks, but there were groups to the side of my hotel room being incredibly loud till late in the night, weird loud  in the room behind mine, and cars revving around the block for hours. I might just not be used to what’s typical noises for the area… but either way it was an unpleasant sleeping experience.",8,Patricia,2025-09-21

"We liked the convenience of this hotel was close to Disneyland and many other business properties around the area. On the other hand, my family and I were disappointed that we booked a 1 bedroom suite which included a kitchenette, but there were little to no cookware, and the smallest cups and bowls. We weren’t able to utilized the kitchenette as how we would’ve liked, so it defeats the purpose of us booking a more expensive room. We called the front desk and their response was so nonchalant, and directed us to the mail the supervisor. We also thought we would be able to see fireworks from our room, as pictured on the website, but that all fluffs. They need to do better with providing cookware and  dinnerware, and stop with the false advertisement. ",6,RASHANA,2025-09-08
"First stay here and we really enjoyed it. The free breakfast is a MUST HAVE, I’ve never experienced anything like that with great prices for the stay.",10,Geneva,2025-09-08
"Nice staff, rooms were clean. The only con was paying the $25 for parking and struggling to find parking space, due to the ice cream shop nearby many of the parking spaces were taken so we parked pretty far. The security guard did end up assisting in finding parking but it was the inconvenience of driving around a couple of times just to find parking.",6,alma,2025-09-07

"If you’re staying the night after a Disneyland day, go to the hotel prior to going in the park and do a “pre-check-in”. Leave your car there and get an uber or lyft to the parks (with tip our total was ($9). It was super convenient and only had to pay for parking at hotel.",10,Monica,2025-08-31

"Our stay began with checking in behind an obvious sex trafficker who insisted on paying with apple pay and using his victim's passport as identification.  After checking in, they were provided a welcome bag.  I checked in with no welcome bag and charged $50 to park my vehicle in a half empty unattended parking lot. This hotel was listed as ""free parking"" during the booking process.  I pointed this out and the staff did nothing about it.  A short time later, my 12 year old alerted me to a large amount of blood smeared on the wall of the elevator.  I told the front desk about the issue and the employee didn't even verbally respond but rather just blankly stared and me and moved on.  The sausage at the breakfast buffet was miserable and was inedible.  I received the obligatory text from the hotel asking about my experience and when I pointed these things out, they did nothing to correct them.  ",4,Joey,2025-08-29

The location was convenient. Front Desk staff was polite. Breakfast was good. It is next to an awesome Italian Ice Shop. The ART Bus picks you up right in front of the hotel parking lot. Only upset that when we made the reservation it did not disclose daily parking charges. They would not waive them so we paid an extra $50.,8,Dona,2025-08-11

"We stayed as a family of three for almost a week during our Disneyland trip, and I honestly cannot fault this hotel. It exceeded our expectations and truly made our holiday special. The front-of-house staff were warm and friendly, the hotel was spotless, and breakfast was plentiful and varied. We went down for breakfast early each morning before the parks opened, and it was pleasantly quiet at that time. The walk to Disneyland was a simple, straight route, but buses and taxis were also readily available. Highly recommended!",10,Heather,2025-08-09

"I went to this hotel with my family for a Disney trip. We arrived at 1am and the first room we were given smelled like dog. It smelled worse than a single dog, it smelled like a pound! I went downstairs and left my family in the dog room while I requested another room. The lady at the front desk was not too friendly and when I told her about the smell, her response was “That’s weird, there hasn’t been a dog in that room in a month”. She gave me a new room but said I had to bring down my entire family in order for her to give me a new room key. It was almost 2am at this point and my entire family was tired from traveling and I explained this to her and that it made no sense making them bring down all the luggage’s just to go back up again, and she said that if we were not all downstairs we wouldn’t be able to switch rooms. After having everyone come downstairs she gave us the new room and we went to sleep. The next morning I was able to take a look at the room and it was FILTHY! The bed had black hairs in the sheets (neither my son nor I have black hair) and the comforter was full of stains. A section even looked like it had dried oatmeal. The towels were full of stains,  and the overall cleanliness of the room was poor. I went down in the morning and immediately checked out and took my family elsewhere. The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is the breakfast was good and the young lady working in the front that checked us out early was very nice.",2,German,2025-08-07

The experience I had at this property was not good. It had very bad plumbing problems. They moved me to another room and had more plumbing problems. Had to cancel plans to Disneyland twice. The front desk was not polite nor understanding. It was like if I was inconveniencing them. Wrote a letter to the CEO about it.  I hardly if ever have negative reviews and im upset writing this.,2,Jason,2025-08-03

"The hotel is fine but they allow Joe's Italian ice next door to park at the hotel's parking lot. Joe's is extremely popular and they open late so when we came back to the hotel around 11pm one night, the whole parking lot was full, lots of teens hanging out at the parking lot. It took 10 mins of us circling around b4 finding a parking space.

"We recently stayed at Hampton Inn & Suites at this particularlocation for the first time . The rooms were comfortable, and the $25 nightly parking fee seemed reasonable. However, parking was a major issue over the weekend. Visitors to the nearby Joe’s Italian Ice Cream frequently used the hotel lot, making it difficult for paying guests to find spots, especially with two young toddlers. The hotel should either enforce parking restrictions more strictly or reconsider charging a parking fee when spots are not reliably available. This parking situation left a negative impression, and we cannot recommend this hotel.",4,Huong,2025-07-15

My only complaint is the windows. They are so thin and offer no barrier against the loud street below. We stayed on the 6th floor and it sounded like I was sleeping on sidewalk. 

Minus one star for customer service but only because we never interacted with staff but they all seemed nice enough.

We didn't like the 25.00 parking fees. Room service every other day. Had to ask for towels 2 times. No glasses in bathroom for brushing teeth. Had a strange odor as you walk in. Breakfast was reasonable. Coffee was good. Had different brewing options. My room comes out to 175.00 . With parking. Did like that. Will look for a free parking option next time.,6,Miguel,2025-05-21

"Room was nice. We faced the fireworks for Disneyland, so that was a bonus. Internet, which we take for granted, IS NOT FREE.  You either give them permission to track you, and share all your personal data, or you pay and they still track you.  Paying is supposed to net you a faster connection however, the lower cost option connection speed is pretty lackluster.  Also keep in mind they reset their network routers every morning, in the early AM. So you'll find yourself re-logging in a lot.  They also have a lot of network counter measures in place.  So don't plan on using their network for any significant downloads.

They also turn the public parking lot into a private lot after 10pm, and force you to pay 25 bucks a night to park your car in it.
So you can park for free all day, but overnight. You pay.

Breakfast was actually pretty good, they offer a couple of breakfast options, yoghurt, bagels, waffles, oatmeal, cereal, tea, coffee and a couple of ""fruit juices."". They did have eggs on one of the days, and sausages.  

The hotel was okay, overall. It was very clean. Employees are very nice, but they are rigid. ""I'm sorry, our policy is...""  Pricing was better than average, but not significantly so.   ",8,David,2025-05-20

Beds are of small size and rolling on, not sturdy. Don’t know why do they charge parking fee!, though there is ample space. I didn’t hang the parking tag, but no one noticed. So parking fee is just a rip. ",6,Prasad,2025-04-15

They also do not guarantee your room will get cleaned daily, which I thought was inconvenient. The entry light in my room was flickering.

"On the second night of my stay I injured my ankle while at Disneyland.   I was able to get an Uber ride back to the hotel.   My 15 year old went to the staff to ask if they had a wheel chair to help me get back to my room - they did not, which is fine, however not one staff member offered to help my child or me to the room.   I had to hop on one foot to the elevator and down the hall.  Not one staff member asked if I was OK or if I needed to see a doctor.    They could not care less.   I was traveling alone with my daughter and it was exceptionally disappointing that the hotel staff made zero effort to show the least bit of empathy or concern.    ",2,Serena,2024-11-04

"Very clean, and very comfortable beds. We have stayed at A LOT of hotels in the Anaheim area. This was our first stay here and I will be back here. 
Only complaint is majority of banking is done with a digital bank, and they do not accept debit cards from digital banks for the deposit, even though they accept it to book the room. Luckily we have a traditional bank as well that I keep a few dollars in, but the type of account we have is printed on the debit card. It starts it’s a virtual wallet account- and the front desk associate was attempting to refuse the card. I told her it was a national bank- and not a digital bank. She told me they only accepted banks that you can “walk into and complete a transaction at”. I told her that you absolutely can walk into a bank branch, even in California! After about 5 minutes of back and forth she agreed to try it and was legitimately surprised when the transaction went through. Minor complaint in the grand scheme of things :) 
We’ll definitely be back.

"We had a nice stay. They provide a basic breakfast with excellent waffles. Staff could be nicer would not recommend the bus to Disneyland. You have young children. That was packed and an inconvenience upon the return from the park. Disneyland is almost a mile and a half away from the hotel. We walked at night as we did not want to wait for the overwhelmed bus. Parking at the hotel is not free overnight parking ($25) at Disneyland is $35 so it adds up easily. The bus cost us half of the Disneyland parking fee, but was a great inconvenience. I would’ve just paid the other half as the Disneyland parking trolley is more efficient.",8,Eileen,2024-08-08

We came in with kids. Is that professional? 
Next day the morning manager was nice and apologized and she got it fixed. It was pleasant after that we enjoyed. Thanks to great customer service by the next day morning manager/ agent. ",8,Ravika,2024-07-22

"Stayed for our wedding anniversary 3 days/ 2 nights. The parking is limited and you must get a parking pass if you stay here. Just know at night parking is non existence.Breakfast is daily and average. Good place for groups and couples. We stayed in a two bed balcony suite(of course they stated Hotels.com overbooked their one bedroom balcony suite) Recommend the Disney side, it is more quiet and nice to be on the balcony at night.Room has a kitchenette, living room, and nice size bedroom. The bathroom was filthy, I always bring Clorox wipes so I cleaned up the tub and toilet better than housekeepers did. I noticed black nets dead on the ceiling in the bathroom.  I take it the housekeepers are too short and they are not getting a ladder to clean it up. Black mold in areas too. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. I have the picture here. Overall nice stay if it is a short, weekend, you are out & about the town. If you want a 3 star plus place with better breakfast options, cleaner rooms and nicer area go somewhere else.",8,Tiffany,2024-07-09
My family and I enjoyed our stay! The hotel offers breakfast that extends till 10am which is very accommodating. Our room was clean for the most part. Beds were comfy and AC was working just right. All the necessary amenities were provide down to shampoos and hand soaps which made things more convenient than having to bring your own. The hotel lobby smelled so good!

"Checked in around 10pm. When we entered 1st room, we noticed an offensive odor. It was late so I thought about just asking for some deodorizer. My daughter and I were walking around room barefoot and my husband in socks and we noticed the carpet between the beds was damp. I thought some kid must have come out of the shower and stood there to dry off. Nope. I bent down and put my nose inches from the carpet and realized it was urine! And, we were stepping on it in bare feet. Front desk moved us to our second room which was accessible. No door on shower made a horrible mess in the bathroom while showering. We did not book a n accessible room so no this was disappointing- no closet, extra dressers missing g to accommodate a wheel chair. Next day moved to our 3 rd room which was fine. Also, on first night my daughter and I were channel surfing and porn was on showtime 2. Girl on girl, 69, going at it. We’re at this hotel to go to Disneyland! ",4,Celina,2024-06-28

"We originally booked our stay from Th 6/13/24 to Mon 6/17/24, but checked out early on Sun morning before 11:00 AM PST due to the loud noise from obnoxious groups of people parking their cars and loitering directly outside our bedroom and living room windows (get all the windows/sliding doors replaced with double-pane sound proof asap).  I had to call the front desk on Sat around 10:30 PM to request they send *local police* to break up the crowd gathering outside our room in the Hampton Inn Suites parking lot, but they sent their own security instead. The obnoxious young punks lingered loudly past midnight. SEND THE COPS NEXT TIME for everyone's safety especially that of our young children. Use room key cards for secured gated parking for patrons only. Now, I need to request Expedia give us a refund for the last night of our booking. ",6,Shelsea,2024-06-18

"The rooms are nice, but the walls are thin. We had noisy neighbors, plus you could hear anyone who walked down the hallway going in and out of their rooms. Whenever someone went in/out, the doors slammed very loudly which woke us up a few times. The drain in the bathroom sink would also make very loud noises at random times, as is if the water from our use earlier was having a hard time going down. Lastly, our TV had no volume. We called the front desk and were about to explain the issue, but they finished my sentence for me, as if they knew we had no volume, or had heard that before. They sent maintenance to come and fix it, so it started working after that.  Overall, we like the hotel and the service m, but it’s a bit too quiet and still needs some maintenance fixes.",6,Fernando,2024-04-15

"Left after one night. Paid extra just to leave. Broken bed. Bloody & hairy pillows that front desk staff Valerie refused to replace. Then called me at 1am to say since I was having so many issues I could pack up right then if I didn’t want to be charged. Ah yes… Let me drive the streets of Anaheim to find a new hotel with small kids in tow because you can’t provide clean pillows? Like what? Actually the most absurd hotel stay I’ve ever had. Luckily Expedia was able to refund me due to a lack of communication from management. It’s also $30 a night to park in their completely unsecured parking lot. I’m an annual passholder at Disneyland so stay all over Anaheim and I’ve never had this type of experience anywhere. I’ve never stayed at a hotel that couldn’t provide pillows at any hour, especially if the ones initially provided had BLOOD on them. Management only attempted to reach out days after I’d left the property. Then they tried to charge me for 5 nights of parking even though upon checkout they swore I’d only be charged for the night and as soon as I checked out charges would stop. I’ve still yet to get my deposit back. Totally insane. Avoid at all costs. ",2,Melissa,2024-04-11

"Heated outdoor pool and hot tub was a plus when traveling with little kids that love playing in pools. 
The buidling itself was aging. Its a skip hop jump from becoming old. It wasnt as nice as the photo made it look, smaller aisle to walk around in the room. I am not a fan of the barn door to the bathroom. The door doesnt seal/close all the way so it lacks privacy. 
Our door squeeled very loudly every time we open/close so we felt guilty going in and out of the room. We tried to stay put, we didnt want to disturb other guests. 
Parking lot is shared by buca de beppos and several other hotels... every day, a car alarm would go off for several hours. It was annoying. 

The bus stop was very convenient! 
Breakfast was ok. Its a little cramped to have 4 waffle stations. The kitchen staff were working hard to replenish. We appreciated them very much! 
Waffles didnt have any fruit. Had whipped cream though. The eggs were ok. Protein was turkey sausage one day and something else another day (ham? Sauage slices). Turkey sausage was not very good. Not kid friendly taste. ",8,Jina,2024-04-09

"Stayed here from January 27th until the 31st, 4 nights. 

Our room was a king Balcony suite, 600  square feet.

Firstly,  check in was easy. We arrived early, around 11 AM and were advised that to get in the room early, there was a charge of $150. No biggie, they stored our bags while we walked to Target which is about 5-10 minutes away depending on your walking pace.

Staff allowed us in to the room a bit earlier than the 3 PM check in at no charge, which was great.

The room was spacious, seemed clean and was great for our family of 3. My 5 year old got the sofa bed and my wife and I used the King bed.

Wallpaper around the shower shows a bit of water damage but otherwise,  the room seemed well kept.

Our room faced Joe's Italian Ice Cream. This is a busy place and there was definitely a lot of noise from traffic etc but nothing the hotel can do.

Breakfast was your standard Hampton Inn breakfast of waffles, an egg dish and either sausages or bacon, cereal, juice, muffins etc.

The pool was nice but unfortunately seemed pretty cold. I'd guess it wasn't heated as the temperature was around 76 - 80 degrees and the water temperature was freezing in comparison. Regardless,  still nice and the hot tub was toasty. 

Overall, a nice hotel within walking distance to plenty of restaurants, stores and a short bus ride to Disneyland. 

#4 ART bus picks you up from the nearby Embassy Suites and takes you right to Disneyland. $6 per day for adults and I believe $4 for a 3 day child pass",8,Tyler,2024-02-01
"Overall stay was great. First day checking in the customer service was not great. The staff did not greet at all, no eye contact, no smile or just simple hello. (did not get name of the staff member) Room was average.

On the second day. Manager Mike was great, helpful and friendly out of all the staff. 

The main washroom on the main floor could use cleaning as there were no towel papers and appeared dirty. 

Breakfast was great. All of breakfast crew were great and had big smile when working. 

I liked the convince of taking puclic transit to Disneyland. Hotel could improve their by renovating them. I heard card racing on street. ",8,ajanpreet,2024-01-31

"Clean and comfortable. The 1 bedroom suite was perfect for my family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids). Very affordable for the space and comfort. I definitely recommend this for a Disneyland trip. Hotel can improve by offering non-dairy milk for breakfast and coffee for people who are lactose intolerant, allergic to cow milk, and/or vegan. I also recommend adding additional plant-based options to the breakfast menu, something easy like potatoes. Front-desk can improve on being patient with parents while they are checking in with young kids in tow. ",8,Alicia,2024-01-22

This is a good hotel if you’re staying at Disneyland but I wasn’t impressed with a few things. I’ve stayed at other Hampton inns that seemed nicer. First off our bathroom door wouldn’t close luckily it was just my husband and I with our toddler. The bathtub didn’t have a drain stopped we have to put a towel to try to keep the water in to have a bath. The snack area in the lobby didn’t have many options. The breakfast in the morning didn’t have many options either hit the breakfast is complimentary so no harm there. It’s a decent hotel if you’re using it to sleep after a day at the theme park but not my first choice as a vacation hotel for sure.  ,6,Sandi,2024-01-08

"I wish my review were a higher one for this hotel.  The location of this establishment to Disneyland is excellent.  The hotel itself not so much.  Our first room did not have a working toilet.  We did not notice until we had already settled in and put all out items away.  It was late at night when we realized our toilet was clogged.  When I called the front desk, they informed me their maintenance people we no longer there.  They were ""generous"" enough to drop off a plunger outside our room for us to figure it out and they did offer us their lobby bathroom (we were on the 6th floor).  My husband tried or a good 30 minutes with no luck to fix the problem. We asked to be moved at about 11 at night.  Once in our new room we settled in only to find out that the conditioner in the shower was actually body lotion.  The breakfast in the morning is a bit of a chaos.  I felt bad for the the understaffed crew handling it all.  You can see and hear how stressed they were.  I can deal with mishaps like the ones we experienced but the staff was not trained to handle these situations.  It was our second time staying at this hotel but it was also our last. 

Tip: stay at a hotel across Disney.  This hotel charges $25/night for parking plus Disneyland charges $30/day.    ",2,Gabriel,2023-10-02

The “free” breakfast is 3 cooked items, eggs, sausages and make your own waffles. When we requested any eggs without meat, something as plain as boiled eggs, the kitchen staff refused.
The rooms were not even equipped with a single bottle of water, nor was their any staff available to provide water, tooth brush or other hygienic products. When requesting the front desk, the lady there was literally screaming on the phone.

"Loved the continental breakfast, the staff was great , they did room clean up by request only , you had to pay for Parking in the Hotel lot , the Bus route and free rides were very confusing. Me and my Family had a great stay other wise . ",10,Jesse,2023-07-27
"Great hotel, great rooms, very good breakfast, etc. The price for parking isn't great, considering people use it for free as temporary parking at night time to go to the ice cream spot across the street. For $25 a night I expect to find near by parking. Not have to park in the back. ",10,Nicole,2023-07-26

Nice and clean property.  We got the suite and it was very very spacious for 6 of us.  Will definitely stay there again.,10,Ani,2023-07-23
"Everyone was very friendly.  We had an issue with our initial room not being clean, but the front desk was quick to have another room ready for us.  Love the space and having a kitchen.  Honestly, the only complaint is having to pay to park.  Otherwise, we had a great time and would stay here again!!",10,Melissa,2023-07-23

There were a few things wrong in our room.  1.  The bathroom door would not close all the way.  2. The AC unit was so loud we could not hear the TV when it ran.  3.  The bathroom sink spontaneously gurgled very loud.  4. There were no hooks close to the shower to hang a towel on and no space to hang or lay your clothes.  2.  ,8,Danks,2023-07-10

Room was dirty (stains on furniture and surfaces not cleaned well - had to wipe away a few dirty areas). 

The room was nice size and comfortable enough. All amenities worked well.

Overall a decent stay, but wont return for the price due to lack of sanitation and customer requests being honored. ",6,charrise,2023-05-04
"The staff was very friendly, and helpful.  As a pet-friendly hotel, it would be nicer if there were a designated pet area that was fenced in and large enough to allow for dogs to run or play fetch.  I wasn't able to give my dog as much exercise as she needs.  Walking up and down the strip isn't enough for some breeds.",10,Kevin,2023-05-01

Family trip to Disneyland. Location was nice. The customer service was great. The little Hispanic girl that was doing the breakfast service was absolutely wonderful. Very polite and professional.

Great hotel- close by Disneyland and it has the bus stop that takes you to the park right outside the hotel ,10,Maria,2023-04-14
Hotel is in great location and easy access to Disneyland. We had an issue with our room with the water leaking from ceiling in bathroom. Reached out to front desk and was told that we need to vacate our current room and again come back downstairs from third floor to get keys for new room. It was really annoying as we were with two small kids waiting outside in the lobby with hotel guests passing by. It was a real bad experience with the person at front desk that one day. Breakfast was good and also the pool area was well maintained and great for kids.,6,Arun,2023-04-11

We enjoyed our stay here at the Hampton Inn. I appreciated how close our room was to the elevator and ice machine. My kids enjoyed the heated pool in 59 degree weather and the jacuzzi. My kids like the morning breakfast. And we all love the walkable food options and Joe’s Italian I’ve right next door. The only downfall was the shower faucet leaked when it was in so it soaked the tub mat but we just had to get an extra one from the front desk. All of the staff were helpful and friendly. ,10,Vickie,2023-03-17

"The hotel itself was great. The price was reasonable, especially when considering the proximity to Disneyland. The breakfast was excellent. 

My biggest issue is that we booked a Queen room (refrigerator & microwave). When you scroll through the pictures on Expedia, you see a picture of a suite with a very clear passage between the living area and the bedroom area. Be warned - if it doesn't say suite in the title of the room, it is NOT a suite. ",8,Kimber,2023-02-17

I didn’t like that the property did not have a bar area. The breakfast was just okay. Too many people and long wait times for waffles or to toast something.
