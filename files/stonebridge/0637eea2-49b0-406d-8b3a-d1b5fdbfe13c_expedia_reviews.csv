"I thought everything was great, the only thing that that suprised me was that they charge you daily to park in the parking lot of the hotel that you already paid to stay at, not to mention the parking lot was almost completely empty the whole time. Seems like Hyatt does well enough to not charge someone $10 a night to park their car at the hotel they are staying at...",8,Blake,2025-09-17

"I booked this hotel due to a funeral so I was there to sleep and then check out in the morning.

Beautiful place and amazing staff.

What I didn't appreciate is when I booked online through Expedia, it was clear that the booking allowed for free breakfast included because it was highlighted in green!  Because of the reason for my booking, free breakfast before leaving for a funeral was a factor in my booking.

To my surprise, I had to pay for the breakfasts (we were 3) that morning.  The hotel tried to look and understand, but they couldn't solve my issue.  It is done now, but in the future I will take a screen shot of any bookings I do in order to have proof.  This was something the hotel had asked for, but I didn't have it.



",6,Tanya,2025-09-10
Hotel is beautiful but the local businesses should really push the city or state for some pedestrian infrastructure in the area. Guests shouldn‚Äôt have to hire an uber to get to the other side of the street.,10,Christopher,2025-09-10

"Excellent service, clean, comfortable. Great alternative to Manhattan hotels",10,Edgar,2025-08-29
"Buying a third party room means that you may get embarrassed upon your arrival or departure. I was unaware of a parking fee and the front desk lady acted personally offended by that, and then also if you don‚Äôt book through the hotel you won‚Äôt know that you need to include breakfast when you book your room (which wasn‚Äôt an option I was given), or pay for the breakfast separately. (Which was also not known to me) so I was ‚Äúturned‚Äù away from breakfast because I didn‚Äôt want to pay an extra $20 plus for myself and a guest. (Theres a full service Starbucks two buildings away) This is all after spending too much on a room and then a little more on parking to stay there. Aside from the money and lack of transparency, you may end up in a room that has peeling paint above the shower head that will drip on you while you shower, and an elevator that scarily jerks to each side upon stopping at a floor. The hallway smelled like a nursing home but our room was clean and smelled decent. ",4,Amanda,2025-08-29

"Hyatt Place is a well maintained modern hotel very close to the George Washington Bridge in Ft Lee. It was conveniently located for us though tricky to get to with all the different highways and roads going every which way . There is a shocking lack of amenities in the rooms. No water , no plastic cups for water , no hand lotion . It could be described as bare bones . The bathroom was very clean and nice but we couldn‚Äôt even take our medication with no cups for water. The bed was adequate but not luxurious . I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll go back . ",6,Catherine,2025-08-17

"Hyatt is a reputed name, and while my stay from July 22‚Äì25 with my family was overall average, one incident left us disappointed. On the nights of the 22nd and 23rd, we were able to enter the hotel late without using our room key. However, on the 24th, the entry gate wouldn‚Äôt open until we scanned our key card, which was never communicated to us. This sudden change left us awkwardly waiting outside with our family. When we asked, the staff simply said it was a security policy. If so, why wasn‚Äôt it enforced or mentioned earlier during check-in? We respect safety measures, but guests deserve consistent communication to avoid such uncomfortable situations.",6,Amit,2025-07-30
"Er is absoluut geen mogelijkheid om met ov te reizen naar NY city. Alles wordt met uber of lyft gedaan. Ga zeker uit van een retour van ‚Ç¨110 euro per dag. Daarom beter om een hotel te nemen in de buurt van NY city. Kost je ook minder tijd. Het duurt minimaal een half uur om er te komen.

Wasmachine werkt met app die voor ons niet werkte. Minimale hulp gekregen van het hotel super jammer.

We had hugs in our room crawling on the pillows. The hotel smelled like cigarettes. Overall very dirty. And then they never told me that it was $15 for parking per night. Until we got there and found out on top of that they charge $1 for every night you stay as tax free on top of the $15 for parking. And there would barely be any parking spot sand make matters worse it‚Äôs self parking for that rate! Bathroom very dirty bathroom stink no ventilation. Wouldn‚Äôt stay here again! ,2,Iara,2025-06-12

"Hotel is overall ok but there are some cons that could be easily improved. The breakfast seems to be quite repetitive - there are no vegetables such as basic tomatoes or cucumber; no ham or sliced cheese. The good thing is that there were at least bananas and apples available nearly every day. 
The other thing the transport to/from hotel. The hotel does not offer any shuttle to/from NYC. If you plan a trip to Manhattan you have limited options due to the position of the hotel near motorway. You could either take taxi (Uber/Lyft) but it might be quite costly (about 40 USD) or walk to the closest bus stop via unpaved footpath. The bus stop is about 10 mins walk either to the gas station or to the Main road. The bus will take you across the GW Bridge to the bus terminal where you could take a connecting subway service. 
The hotel itself is quite clean, no damp or odd smell. The staff was friendly and polite. The rooms are spacious with daily cleaning service. We had a room on a highway site of the hotel so we could hear some noise from the traffic. Fortunately we are not too sensitive to that so we got used to it quite quickly and we could get a good sleep without any disturbance. 

Overall I would rate the hotel 8/10.",8,Jaroslav,2025-05-16

"Terrible Staff. Booked 2 rooms on the same booking through Expedia. The hotel just gave us one room initially and flat out denied the 2nd room. They did not look into it and repeatedly just asked us to contact expedia customer care and resolve it. 

Very unhelpful and rude staff. 

They also did not have wifi running. We really needed wifi for work and asked the staff if there was anything they could do to help us get reliable internet connection. Absolutelty nothing, no alternative offered. Just a rude response - ""oh yes, its not been working""

"We always stay at the Hyatt when we go to Sloan which is often and this experience was awful, so much, you couldn't pay me to go back...a fee for parking. A fee for breakfast. The deposit was more than the room itself. 
There are no vending machines and the little shop sells theee micro sodas that go for about 3 dollars a pop. 4 dollar bottle water..

Our room was fine until my daughter too a shower, used a towel and broke out in a head to toe rash. Harsh detergent or maybe hard water. For a ""luxury"" hotel it wasnt thought over.  And then to top it off a woman knocked on my door while we were sleeping to see when we were leaving. This was at 830 AM. One there is a comoiter that can give you that information in the lobby and two are you kidding me?

The feont desk was not friendly. It took 8 minutes to check in and not so much as a goodbye on the way out. 

Now that i have spot hero. We will stay in the city and probably save money.

This is a good hotel to stay at if you need a jumping off point to go to New York City especially Harlem because it's right near the George Washington bridge the only downside to this was you're right by the freeway and there is a little bit of freeway noise you can hear if you're facing the freeway,8,Scott,2024-09-22

"I ran 2 conferences last week and had over 50 people booked here.  The staff was either rude or clueless. For example: 1) They were not willing to change reservations at all, like add or remove a day. 2) We ordered dinner in the restaurant, and they were out of most things. It took 1.5 hours to get simple things like chicken fingers and sandwiches. 3) They did not tell me about parking fees when booking, and a sticker warned that my car would be impounded - note, based on where it is located, it's not like anyone would park here unless they were going to the hotel. 4) Towels strewn by housekeeping and left too few.

I won't stay here again - whether it is one room or 50 like we had, all customers deserve better.",4,Alyssa,2024-06-09

This location is very convenient with easy access to New York City just over the bridge. They offer a free breakfast with a decent variety of items to choose from. The staff at the front desk was polite and helpful.  The room itself was clean but the condition of the carpet in our room was terrible. It had large stains all over it. This was very disappointing and detracted from an otherwise positive stay.,8,Kelsey,2024-05-06
"FYI: I'm a World of Hyatt member, but chose to book through Hotels.com. The room seemed smaller than what I'd previously had with the same room name and the paint was chipping on the ceiling above the sink of room 318 and the sink drainage was so sk...
Otherwise, everything worked...was clean and the shower was excellent. Minor cosmetic issues do make we wonder if idnbe given the same room had I booked through my Hyatt account. 

Between this location and the next door Doubletree, this place is the winner. I'd stopped booking here due to their pricing (parking fee for an outside non secured  lot?!?!) but Doubletree let their quality sink so low that it looks as though I'll be dealing with Hyatt.  ",8,Rosanna,2024-05-05

"L'hotel √® bellissimo,  curato e molto pulito.  I letti sono comodissimi,  le stanze in pieno inverno sono belle calde. All'interno dell'Hotel c'√® sia un bar che un piccolo ristorante dove si pu√≤ pranzare o cenare ed il cibo √® buono.  Prezzo onesto e pi√π ergonomico che New York . La colazione non √® molto varia ma comunque buona e abbondante. 

I punti a sfavore di questo posto per me sono stati solo 2.
1. Non √® ben servito dai mezzi pubblici, la metro non √® raggiungibile a piedi, dovrete avere una macchina a noleggio o in alternativa affidarvi a uber.
2. Ho fatto la doccia fredda 7 sere su 10. Poco piacevole in pieno inverno e nonostante ho segnalato il problema non √® stato risolto ed il personale √® scortese con chi non √® del posto!

Nel complesso √® un ottimo posto e lo prender√≤ in considerazione se dovessi tornare d'estate. ",8,Michela,2024-01-11

"Location, fine. Rooms are as expected but the front desk/bar service was deplorable. The ponytailed guy in the suit, Michael, had attitude from the minute we walked in. I only learned his name the next morning after talking to the am supervisor, as Michael didnt wear any nametag the whole time and was using a bartender‚Äôs ID to write and ring info.
Abrupt and curt. Like he wanted to be anywhere else but the Hyatt. 
Later, I went down to the bar to get a glass of wine. I asked for a bar menu, and he acted as if I was inconveniencing him. He then slid the menu over and stared at me the entire time without saying one word. 
He then charges me double for the glass, and when I told him about the mistake, he said the extra amount was tax. It was not, as there was a separate tax line item. Instead of any apology, he said ‚ÄúIm just going to give you more wine because I already charged you.‚Äù
At this point, he was such a jerk, I told him I wanted to pay the right price, and he continued to refuse.when he finally agreed, instead of doing it, he proceeded to get bills and food for other customers, intentionally making me wait. I have stayed at many Hyatt and Grand Hyatt hotels and have never come across such a rude individual. It is clear he hates his job. He is inhospitable in the hospitality industry. I was shocked to learn the next morning that he is the night manager. He tarnishes Hyatt‚Äôs image. The daytime workers were great, so it‚Äôs sad he wrecks the experience. ",2,Annie,2023-11-10

There was a bug in our hotel room. They gave us another room as an option. There were swarms of bugs coming out of that vent. We opted to just stay in our first room since we have kids and it was going to be a pain to pack up everything and go across the street to the doubletree.

"I stayed at Hyatt Place Fort Lee Hotel for 4-nights as I was visiting from Toronto, Canada with my family. The entire stay at this Hotel was simply amazing. Staff were friendly, hotel rooms were clean and further cleaned/re-stocked with fresh towels and bed sheets everyday while we were gone for the day. 

Even though I did not get around to using it, I did check out the gym on the 9th floor. The gym looked clean with new looking workout equipment. The laundry room on the 5h floor was in a small room with a washer and dryer in it. The air conditioner in our room was also nice and cold which made us forget about the 30  degree celsius outside.  

My favorite part of staying at this Hotel was the complementary breakfast which was offered between 6 - 9 AM everyday. The buffet-style breakfast had many options to pick from including scrambled eggs, home fries, different breakfast cereals, fresh fruits, bagels, toasts and juices such as apple and orange juice. My family really enjoyed having a great breakfast before heading out on our daily adventures. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends. 5 Stars out of 5. Its family and pet friendly.

Just do keep in mind, parking is NOT FREE at this Hotel. I did end up paying $12/day for parking and had no other issues while parking at this hotel.

They are in the service business and they didn‚Äôt look like they were happy to be there.  I have to greet the front desk person.  When I should be greeted and feel welcoming.,10,SIRINUCH,2023-06-21

"I couldnt figure out why a hotel this nice cost so much less than similar hotels in the area.  I learned why quickly when upon arrival our navigation sent us walking for about a half mile to the hotel, but directly behind it (no exaggeration) 30 feet up on a rock wall.  After calling an Uber to take us 10-15 minutes around to the front entrance of the hotel we realized that this was a crash course in how hard it was to get to the hotel from NY, even Google couldnt figure it out.  We also didnt know about tolls and taxes we'd have to pay so everytime we crossed over to NY or crossed to NJ coming back, a 10 minute ride cost 35-45 dollars.  The reviews said that there were close places to eat, but none were walkable, but we didnt understand just how inconvient this location was.  A hotel shuttle running from the interstate to the adjacent area and back and forth across the bridge would make this a 4 star experience. I'd even be willing to pay a nominal fee or even pay more for the room itself.  At the least, the hotel should do a better job explaining how inaccessible this location is.  ",6,Mark,2023-06-05

The tv says it can chromecast but does not actually allow you to do so, and the air conditioner was right in the room and very very loud. Otherwise the room was nice, the appliances were all functioning, the bed was clean and very comfortable. We chose this location for it's proximity to the bridge, however it is entirely unwalkable due to a lack of sidewalks unless you go about an hour around. ",8,Carolyn,2023-05-23

"The location is very ok. Theres trash right in front of the hotel-highway.. not sure whos responsible for that. The beds were not comfortable. I was looking forward to the nice sleep everyone gets in hotels but unfortunately this was not the case. The mattress definitely needs to be changed- it was almost like a sink hole was in the middle of the mattress. The fitted sheets had some type of dried up substance. Do not know how the cleaners did not see that. The bathroom's shower had a rust drip going down the wall on to the floor. I do not see how the shower could be cleaned properly and still have that there. If you dont care for this then go for this hotel. I wouldve happily paid a few more bucks for a better quality hotel, bed and shower.
