"We booked a queen bed with a view. But were given a room in the corner with a view of the building AC equipment and a full size bed, NOT the queen size we were hoping. When I asked about it, the front desk attendant didn't care, just seemed annoyed, and said they were out of rooms. The hotel was decent but definitely not worth $300 a night. The staff on the other hand, at least the person I dealt with was by far the worst part of the hotel.",2,edgar,2025-08-31

The a/c wasn’t working I called and called and no one answered. Barely slept due to sweating and too tired to get dressed to go to the lobby.

"It's a wonderful hotel in a great location. The only problem was how they handled a problem. My hot water wasn't working. I asked them to check it each day. Each day, instead of fixing it, I received the response: ""you should have told us about it! We would have fixed it."" 


""I don't understand. I'm telling you about it now.""


The third day, at least, someone came to the room and tried to do something. My bathroom was disassembled. But still not working. 

I did a 10 second cold shower, enough to wash a dab of shampoo out. 


I checked out and when asked how my stay was, said ""It's a nice place but I had no hot water the whole time.""

""We would have moved you if I had known!""


I just left. Is this some new customer strategy - blaming the customer?

I'd like to stay here again but I'm cautious.

They accommodated my unusual request to store pizza and held onto my bags even after checkout which was very nice. The room itself was very clean and modern, though a bit small.

"The property was nice, the rooms were nice and modern. The restaurant was inside was nice as well. Only problem I had was when I reserved the room it stated a fridge would be there. When we checked in we were told a fridge was there. We get in the room no fridge, called the front desk they said that they were all accounted for and they would bring one the next morning. By the time they brought the fridge we didn’t need it anymore as we were leaving the next day. Only thing they could offer was a breakfast voucher we stated we wouldn’t be using because we would have to catch our flight and didn’t have time to stop for breakfast.",10,Corliss,2025-06-16

There is NO parking and the closest garage charged us $110 for 2 nights  to park our cars . Overall it was a nice hotel room , quiet and the uber picked us up and dropped us off right out front . There no refrigerator In the room and you were out of luck if you needed ice because it was on the LL. Enjoyed my stay but for the price I would stay somewhere nicer next time .

"The place and the area was clean and quiet. 

It’s an 8 minute walk or shorter to the 34th penn station subway and a three minute walk to 34th hudson yard. Although it is not exactly close to high-traffic areas in midtown, the quiet surrounding is such a breath of fresh air after the craziness of the subway. There is a 24-hour gas station convenience store, and dunkin donot one block from there for your last minute needs. The hotel is clean and the rooms are new and fresh. So unlike the older hotels in nyc. Decent size for manhattan standard. Awesome helpful staff at the reception. Everybody was helpful. 

Good and brand new amenities in the room. Nice larger than life mirror and great bathroom lighting. I an staying here again

Posh karaoke bar down the block across that gets busy on friday and saturday night but nothing rowdy. You may want to plan a night there.

OUTSTANDING!!!

Property was in a good location. We got locked out of our room after a long day of walking because the keypad failed. They were able to dismantle the pad but we had no access to get in or out after. They said they would compensate us and give us breakfast the next morning when engineering could fix it and we would get our new keys. The people at the front desk had no idea what we were talking about the next day. Our room finally got fixed in the afternoon. They should’ve waited for us to be there because we had personal items in the room that could have been stolen. Not sure if we’d stay there again after that fiasco. ,4,Glynda,2025-04-20

There was a strong smell of plastic/furniture oils as another reviewer recently noted, which may be from new furniture pieces installed in the room. It was pretty overwhelming, so we opened our windows, but then the noise from the street kept us up.",8,Lynn,2025-04-11

"I had a fantastic stay at Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan Midtown West. Compared to other hotels near Times Square, this place offers excellent value for money—some nearby options were nearly three times the price!

The location is a huge plus—just a short walk to the Hudson Yards subway station, making it super convenient to get around the city. You're also right by Hudson Yards and the High Line, two must-see attractions in NYC.

There are also plenty of great dining options nearby, from casual bites to more upscale spots. Overall, a great stay for anyone looking for comfort, convenience, and a solid price point in Midtown Manhattan.",10,Renjie,2025-03-24

"As far as NYC hotels go I was surprised by the size of the room which I found to be more than enough for the location. Rooms and especially bathroom was clean, fresh and renovated. Restaurant and bar were closed for upgrades but there is a great little breakfast spot right next door and loads of great restaurant options within a short walk of the property. Marvin, the front desk manager, makes any stay perfect as he is engaging, pleasant, helpful and efficient in every respect. He and his team handle things efficiently and even when I stupidly left my laptop in the room - it was safely in lost property at the days end when I got back to the property. I had from Marvin two great restaurant options and both turned out to be amazing - Tavola an authentic Sicilian and Unlce Jacks, an excellent steak/fish eatery both close by. Location great if you are doing a show at Javitts, a useful USP store 5 minutes away and the centre a 10 minutes walk. Given it was - 13c during our stay the location was great. Kudos again Marvin and team for running a tight ship and keeping us all on track - who said New York was unfriendly, I found everyone everywhere friendly and service orientated. The only thing I did not enjoy was the recent decriminalisation of soft drugs like weed, the city streets stink of it - gross - even outside the police stations people walk by joint in hand puffing away - scared for the city in a few years time with this!! Kudos Marvin, see you next time in NYC",10,Nicholas,2025-02-07

"A very nice place. Room was tiny, but clean Bed was comfortable. I'm sensitive to noise, but despite being close to the elevator I didn't hear anything. New York is New York and there at night you could hear the wail of ambulances. This is near lots of traffic rather than in a residential neighborhood. I was on floor 10, Would it have been better on floor 20? The neighborhood seemed safe, but it was easy to walk past the front desk to the elevators and you don't need a key to take the elevator. Requiring a key would be a good safety precaution. It's becoming more common. The hotel is 2 long blocks from the 8th Ave subway, which makes if a good location for healthy people. I feel lucky to have found this hotel at a reasonable price, but I think I'll look for something quieter and farther East for future trips. And if this is the only one available I'll feel happy about it.",8,Joshua,2025-01-05

"This hotel is small compared to others in the area but it was great for our family of four. A lot of attractions within walking distance, even Times Square. We stayed on the 10th floor and got an amazing view of 10th Ave headed north. It did get pretty noisy at times and it can be a lot, but once you get used to it the car horns create a lil symphony. The restaurant downstairs i feel was overpriced for the quality, but there is a “Fresh&Co” just outside and they have what i feel is better food at a reasonable price. The gym is decent and the hotel is fairly clean. Definitely would stay here again. Great area for families. ",8,Eduardo,2024-12-03
"Definitely a great location. We arrived on a wet rainy day, but the service was super nice and friendly. We checked in and got to our room. The doors all slam a bit loudly, but whatever. The room wasn't too small or too big, even for two people we were comfortable. The bathroom is a good size and the shower was great. They don't have the ""extras"" in the bathroom (like shower caps), but I bet if you asked the front desk they would get you one. However, they have a good shampoo/conditioner/body wash/lotion/etc to use. 

As mentioned, the location is great. We walked everywhere- super convenient. The bed was comfortable and the tv had good channels. I would definitely return again.",10,Michael D,2024-12-02

"The Hotel Name is a bit Deceptive as it is a Sheraton but it is owned by Marriott. Different Ownership and Different Management Style. 

The Rooms are quite Small (150 Sq Ft) and not quite the Comfort that we normally expect. Also, the Name Four Points Sheraton is not Clear. There is another Four Points Sheraton  Times Square located on 40th Street and Nineth Avenue in Times Square which is a Horrible, Unsafe Location with all the Drunks and Homeless people.

Then, there is the Four Points Sheraton Manhattan Midtown West about 5 blocks away on the corner of 35th Street and Tenth Avenue.
A lot nicer area near Penn Station.

"Overall, the hotel was good, and the location was excellent—very convenient for exploring Manhattan. However, we did encounter a few problems during our stay. When we checked in, the receptionist asked if we wanted our room cleaned the next day, to which we said yes. Unfortunately, when we returned the following day, the room hadn’t been cleaned.

Additionally, the noise levels in the room were quite high. The air conditioner was very loud when it was on, and when we turned it off, we could hear outside noise clearly due to poor insulation. The sound of traffic kept us awake through the night, which made it hard to get a good night's rest.

Despite these issues, the hotel has potential with its great location, but some improvements in noise control and housekeeping are needed.",8,Sergey,2024-10-23

Too much talking between desks workers and not attentive leaving to slow response. Tried speaking Mandarin to me. I don't even speak that language and speak perfect English. Upon arrival room was not ready and even after waiting for a king bed they stuffed us into a double bed calling it an ""upgrade"". Bell hop tried to smooth it out and was helpful. AC stopped working on the 3rd night. Shout-out to the engineer Vincent for helping us fix it otherwise staff deserves 1 star rating.

"I got there a little bit early and my room wasn’t ready so I accepted to take a smaller ( queen bed) room. 

Keep in mind that the difference between a king and a queen room isn’t just the bed. I had to ask for a change after the first night because of the lack of space. The queen bedroom is literally a bed and a bathroom with almost no space to walk and almost impossible to open your luggage. 

Once I get my original room everything was just perfect. Much bigger room, super comfortable bed and sheets and the view was just great. 

The staff is very friendly and the hotel is 5 minutos away from Hudson Yards. Great zone to stay at. ",8,Luis,2024-07-14

",10,Nicole,2024-01-01
Clean and convenient to major sites and attractions.,10,Diane,2023-12-30
"Staff friendly and location very good. Main issues with the hotel for me were: 
1 - the size of the room. Paid a premium for higher floor with view but the room was extraordinarily small. Friends booked similar and was even smaller. My room was just about acceptable for 1 person, but their initial room had even less storage and smaller footprint. They moved to a twin which was great size and what I would recommend to anyone
2 - noise from the lift shaft. I spoke to staff on 3 occasions and was told ""it must be construction nearby"". It was like pots and pans being knocked together and the noise (despite me being a little bit away from the lifts) came through the vents in the room. I had to use ear plugs to get to sleep. Never had to do this before. When I travelled up the lifts to the 18th floor I could hear the same sounds from the shaft so it was definitely the lifts. 
If a light sleeper I would either ask to be as far away from the lifts as possible or avoid completely. 

Was nice to have tea and coffee available throughout the day, staff were friendly/helpful and location is very good with easy walk to Penn, Empire State, Subway etc

The amenity space in reception is way too small for a hotel of this size. One small couch is not enough. Not sure if the restaurant space is meant to be used but didn't feel that this was welcome",6,Gerard,2023-12-29

Staff: Hotel staff was very helpful. We had a full day and arrived the city early as 9:30am. They accommodated us for early check in to a better available room, since checkin time is usually 3:00 pm. So I am very pleased with the staff. 
Cleanliness: Since we just checked in and went out for the day, there was no time to check the room properly. I noticed in the evening that there were used cups filled with old coffee at the coffee making station in the room. So I would not give good rating on cleanliness.

This was my second time staying here. I love the modern rooms and how the hotel is small and not touristy. It's kinda hidden away but in a great location. The staff is really nice and helpful and the coffee is great - which is rare! The rooms are small but with great views of the city. ,10,Walter,2023-02-07

"When I went to my room after checking in, I found the following: A dirty cleaning rag left on the night table; a burned out lightbulb in the bedside lamp; a dirty toilet (with dried poop clinging to the inside of the bowl). Housekeeping came right away and rectified the situation but it still made for a very bad first impression. ",4,Rebecca,2023-02-02
This hotel was very nice and the staff kind. I was given a piece of paper with the name and address for a parking lot. I was told that the parking was discounted and the hotel stamped my ticket. When I arrived to the garage the parking lot attendant informed me that the parking lot was the next door over and had the same name and address as their lot but a different company. I had to pay $70 for 1 night!This was so misleading I suggest the hotel knows to direct guest to the correct lot since they both have the same name and address ,6,Marie,2023-01-31

The property was great.  Check in was incredibly easy and the Yuri who greeted me honestly made my bad day much better with his kindness and friendliness.  Parking was super easy and close to the location.  Room was nice and the updated features in the room were a nice touch.,10,Nicole,2023-01-30

"We had to move rooms twice.. 1st time the people next to us were blasting a speaker and screaming , second time  The heat/AC didn’t work and when we got to the 3rd room the tv didn’t work :-/ .. the staff was exceptionally nice though and very clean. I like that they lock the lobby door after 12am so no one can just waltz in and start walking around . The area is fine, I’m from NYC so nothing bothers me.. there is over night parking on the street but you have to move the car at 7am… if you go up to 47th street/48th street between 9th and 10th avenue there is weekend parking to where you don’t need to move the car on the weekend. Totally worth the 12 block walk or $10 dollar Uber. Most garages here are $60 plus over night. ",8,Juliana,2023-01-14

I really enjoyed my stay even with all the construction noise outside. The room was spacious. The table was a little damaged but that was fine. I did leave my charger and was able to call them to hold it for me. ,10,Jasmine,2023-01-09
Hotel tres bien situe proche du hi line et de time square ....vraiment excellent et en plus au prix que je l ai eu.,10,Christophe,2023-01-08
Perfect for a weekend stay in Midtown. Within walking distance to many major attractions. Appeared to be a bit short staffed at times but all staff were pleasant despite this. Wish the room had a fridge or microwave but otherwise a nice room. ,8,Lori,2023-01-08
