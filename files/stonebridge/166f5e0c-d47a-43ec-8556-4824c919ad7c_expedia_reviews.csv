"We really enjoyed our stay here. The hotel is very nice and simple, with everything we needed for a comfortable visit. The main downside was that the rooms aren’t very soundproof, so we could hear noise from other guests, but it didn’t impact our overall stay. The area and neighborhood are great, with plenty nearby and close access to the subway, which made getting around very easy. Overall, a great experience – we would definitely stay again.

Reception staff were so lovely - can’t fault this place 10/10. ",10,Emma,2025-09-28

"We had a fantastic stay. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was excellent---cozy, but SO comfortable. The scent in the room was overpowering at first, but natural and not synthetic-smelling, so it didn't bother me long term. It may bother others. The bed was a cloud of comfort. Having a little kitchenette was actually amazing---even in such a small room---and was something I didn't realize I needed in a hotel room. The pour-over coffee was an amazing touch. Our room was missing creamer, but didn't bother asking for some because it was good coffee as is, but that is a detail that should be checked. The location was really convenient for subway access and was walkable to a show at Warsaw, which is why we were visiting. A great weekend! ",10,Jeanne,2025-09-15
Absolutely obsessed with this hotel! It is so charming and literally perfect in every way. They’ve thought of everything and each detail is just lovely. ,10,Jessica,2025-09-14

"We enjoyed our stay at The Penny Williamsburg. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. Nice little courtyard out back and we had a nice dinner at ElNico, their rooftop restaurant. Only a few minutes walk to the L train station. We loved the pour over coffee in the room and the free coffee downstairs in the morning.",10,Joseph,2025-09-11

"If you like artistic or different from status quo,  this is the place to stay when in the area. You get the artist vibe upon walking in the front door. I was greeted with a smile and welcomed immediately. A room was ready for me even though I was early. My room was perfect in every way. Just what I needed. All I can say is they were eager to please and be helpful. Pet friendly. To see a dog is a good thing. Loved the in room pour over coffee, fridge, microwave, yoga mat, and roller.

"Second time visiting New York, first time in Williamsburg. Loved the hotel. Booked a room with my girlfriend an hour before checking-in and was impressed with the quick check-in, attention to detail in the creative decorations, amenities offered in the room  such as 2 bathrobes, utensils for takeout, yoga mat+roller, automatic curtains, adjustable mood lighting, nice hygiene/shower products, and a cork bulletin board in the room with all necessary information. Great view as well. Dope looking rooftop bar/restaurant although we just got takeout from a thai place around the corner. Noticed that they even provide bikes for guests to borrow, although we didn’t take advantage of that this time.

Cool place, I’d recommend ",10,Ethan,2025-08-01

"The room was perfect for what we were looking for. The only issue we had was that the seal on the shower door was not complete and resulted in some water leaking from the bathroom towards the entrance door, but staff was quick to solve this issue when I called the front desk and we had no further issues. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone, we will definitely be coming back! ",10,Brittni,2025-07-26

"The walls are super thin. We could hear everything outside in the hallway and from the rooms surrounding ours. We barely got any sleep because we could hear everything. 
Also there’s no way to turn off the closet light. There are no switches to turn it off. It was on all the time, even with the closet doors completely closed, and was shining through the creaks of the closet the entire time we were there. 
The shower was really confusing because even when the knob was on cold, the water was super hot.  ",8,Parinita,2025-07-07

"Left a bag of new Baggus in the closet. Called the hotel and they said nothing was found and will contact me if anything turned up, but didn’t ask for contact info, and never followed up. I know it was there. Can’t prove it, but it’s a bad feeling. Just a reminder to double-check before you go.

"For some reason the water in the bathroom and kitchenette would not get cold at all - only got hot water, which isn't great for drinking :( 

Also, the shower wasn't sealed good and leaked all over the bathroom floor. I also found it difficult to find the TV remote, which was located in the box that the TV was housed within.

Other than that, my short stay was great. I thoroughly enjoyed the rooftop and the little details such as the oranges, adorable robes, and message board. It was convenient having the breakfast items available to purchase as well as the free coffee so I didn't have to wander to find something.",8,Amy,2025-06-03

Very glad we stayed in a deluxe queen so there was the ability to get in and out of bed on both sides. The staff are very good! We had a problem with our air conditioning (room 207) which improved the next day after they sent up an engineer. However it was the fan they gave us that saved the three nights. Very nice roof top bar and cute decor in the lobby and rooms.,8,Verified traveler,2025-05-17

Loved the small table and comfortable chairs. Nice themed room!",10,Melanie,2025-05-17
"Hotel was perfect. They were accommodating with my morning checkin request.
Room was clean with a comfortable bed, cozy bathrobe and had a decent amount of space considering NY hotel sizes.
I appreciate how they have water stations on every floor so you don’t need to run thru plastic water bottles.

It is in a great location, many bars and restaurants in Williamsburg and their staff was attentive and personable.  We needed the pull out sofa for our stay, and the staff had someone up to make up the bed before we made it upstairs.  Loved the rooftop bar and restaurant for amazing  views, drinks and tacos.

"For the small footprint of the room, it was very spacious and well planned.  An actual bathroom with a door - in Williamsburg! And the shower had a door too… there was a sink in the main room, a kettle and the equipment you need to make a pour over coffee..  they’ve got a steamer in the closet so you can get those wrinkles out of the fine drip you will be parading around Brooklyn in.  Great artwork and books in the room. I will stay here next time in BK if the rooms are as affordable as they were this time around.  I spent 1 night, a Thursday. ",10,Robert,2025-05-09

Staff were very accommodating and helpful! I made a late reservation on Friday evening for Saturday and Sunday. I needed an accessible room. The did not have the same room available for both nights. The kind gentleman taking my reservations contacted the manager and they were able to move some things around. That meant I was able to stay in the same room for both nights and that was great. Ordered room service from elNico. The food was delicious and reasonably priced.

"Nice thoughtful amenities, such as fresh oranges, and an environmentally friendly coffee/tea situation, hand/body lotion, fun colorful plush robes, and steamer, etc, etc.  All of it tidily arranged.  The local artwork featured throughout the facility really feels representative of the area.  The convenience of the rooftop restaurant bar is a plus and furthermore they have a vast collection of tequilas and mescals and the staff displayed great knowledge.  The food was well done, I tried the Tacos and Mole' sampler platter with 5 varieties of mole', which was excellent. I will definitely stay here again when Brooklyn calls.",10,Michael,2025-02-17

Convenient location walkable to everything with a fully stocked deli/bodega around the corner.
ElNico restaurant is quite fancy and the food was very good. Mexican food not my favorite but the guacamole and ceviche were to die for. Fabulous cocktails and a stunning view.
Only quibble: need more than 4 hangers!

"It felt too sterile and institutional, the room was clean but too minimal, the concrete ceiling made it feel more unfinished than a good design choice.  The whole minimalist design choice didn't like a good one in the cold winter.  The outside areas were all closed down because of the weather.  Only a few dried out snacks were available on a rack across from the check in counter.  Wrong time of the year to have given this a try.

On top of that, in addition to the room rate and fees/taxes they charge a $34.43 additional per day as a ""destination fee"" when you check out.  Really?  ",6,Frank,2025-01-02
"We came to stay for New Years and it was a great hotel! Very clean, minimalist, and cozy. Staff were great and very welcoming. It also passed the bed bug check; I am very paranoid about staying in hotels because of that reason, but Penny Williamsburg was so clean and felt like a home away from home. The only thing that wasn't working or what we couldn’t figure out what the fan in the bathroom! Overall, great stay, great hotel, and great staff. ",8,Julia,2025-01-02

"I love the location of the Penny, and the staff is great. This was my second stay, the first being a few months back. The rooms are cute and clean, with a few notable design flaws. I got the same room each time, identifiable by the broken reading light hanging from the headboard. I was surprised to see it again, months later, still visibly broken. It made me wonder if this room is kept in ratty shape and just rented out to hotel tonight and hotel.com customers? This time though, the automated blind was also broken and could not be lowered. I was exhausted and coming down with something (had lost my voice and could barely speak), so I told the front desk about the problem but couldn't wait for them to send a technician. I wasn't confident that they'd be able to do so quickly, and I just had to get to sleep. ",8,Hallie,2024-12-27

A couple suggestions for the room - offer kleenex; regular creamer rather than just hazel nut; instructions for lights-housekeeping apparently turned on the light over the sink which was helpful but then we couldn’t get it to go off; finally succeeded but were unable to leave a light on in the bathroom at night - they all went off. Tried calling the desk Sunday evening to ask assistance on the lights, but got no answer. Very confusing lighting system. Also realized I didn’t get a receipt and had to call to find out there was a $150 deposit that would be reimbursed, which is fine, but we were not informed and nothing in writing.

I split my trip into two parts—half in Manhattan and the other half in Williamsburg to be closer to friends. Choosing The Penny was a fantastic decision! The location is super convenient, and the tech-savvy amenities make everything so easy. It feels less like a hotel and more like you're staying in a cozy studio apartment. For longer stays, it’s even better: the little fridge and microwave are perfect touches since most hotels don’t offer those. Plus, they provide utensils and have great seating arrangements.

"The hotel was all that we hoped. The staff was welcoming, bright clean atmosphere. I loved the view out my window over the bed, a nice “wild” garden with hydrangeas and anemone flowers blooming. The layout of the small room was very clever and well throughout making it feel roomy. Everything you can need is there, including an umbrella. The location was convenient to the “G” subway line, though we found it is temporarily closed for most of the southern route. There we nice little cafes within a short walk. Pleasant stay!",10,Lorrie,2024-09-01

"I like how close it was to transportation. Entertainment on the TV was good and wifi. Check-in was simple and quick. Staff seemed  but more helpful to other guests though. It wasn’t a very clean room either. There was a stain in the comforter, wondering it it was even changed or washed. I really really dislike the smell of the soap. Please change that. ",6,K,2024-08-17
"The Penny is a nice boutique hotel in Williamsburg that I’m glad I stayed at.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I was allowed to check in early, which gave me a chance to rest and leave my bags somewhere safe after a cross-country red eye flight.  The design of the room is colorful and vibrant.  I was particularly impressed with the Fellow kettle and preground coffee beans.  You are able to pour two sets of flavorful medium roasted coffee in the comfort of your own room!  I didn’t get to go to the rooftop bar while I was there but there seem to be some nice amenities at the hotel I didn’t partake in.  There are also some highly regarded restaurants nearby the hotel.  I’d definitely stay there again if I return to Brooklyn.",10,Verified traveler,2024-08-15

Nice touches included the pour over coffee service in the room and the opportunity to borrow bikes and an umbrella. We also enjoyed the bowl of oranges left in our room. The only thing noticeably missing was a box of tissues. Also the bed is pushed to a wall on one side so it was tricky to get out of bed if you are the second person lol. The subway is only a couple blocks away so easy access to everywhere. The rooftop restaurant was a nice perk - delicious, great service and beautiful view. ",8,Sheryl,2024-07-03

1. ADA shower was pretty small and the curtain was even smaller, to the point where it was almost negligible. There was practically no way to stop water from getting all over the entire bathroom floor.
2. Not a huge fan of the clown colored bath robe :) Unless its meant to be an art piece for the room. In that case, go off!",8,Shemar,2024-06-24

The location is everything and our room was lovely. The pour over coffee in our room served a perfect cup. My one critique would be that we had called front desk a few times for some small complimentary items to restock in our room but we didn’t receive them, & one of the QR codes for room service wasn’t working but honestly pretty minor of a nitpick. if you speak to staff in person they’re super accommodating and sweet!

"The hotel is very conveniently located to restaurants, shops and McCarren Park in Williamsburg.

We stayed over a weekend to run the Brooklyn Half Marathon. The night before the race the music was so loud from the bar on the 11th floor it was very difficult to sleep in a room on the 3rd floor. The sound came through the vents in the bathroom. Room was small as expected but nice and cleaning staff were great. 

After the race I received a text inviting us to a special brunch on the 11th floor restaurant for runners offering a gift basket. When we arrived we were told the special event was for a local running club only (not sure why they texted me then). The view was amazing but we were told we could not sit outside due to the event for runners. 

We were nearly alone in the restaurant but it took 20  minutes to get our order which left out the avacado in the avocado toast and our order of pancakes. The “eggs any style” ordered over easy were sunny side up and not fully cooked. When delivered, there was only one pancake ($17) and we were told the word “pancakes” plural on the menu was a typo. They removed the $17 charge. 

The EINico is probably a great place to party but not for food and if you need to sleep, a weekend stay isn’t a good option. ",6,LeRoy,2024-04-30

A quaint, and incredibly hospital Brooklyn apartment style hotel made for our own little home away from home. The seemingly small, but actually big touches such as filtered water available, yoga mat, and pour over coffee pot in every room, and the freshly brewed coffee from a local cafe in the lobby daily. These all including the cozy bed, and location in Brooklyn made for a perfect couples getaway. Would stay at the Penny again! ",10,Victoria,2024-04-01

Loved the design of this hotel (modern with pops of color) and a knockout rooftop restaurant/lounge (EL Nico). My Queen room was quiet and very spacious. Comfortable mattress and thoughtful touches like a yoga mat and block, delicious pour over coffee set up, colorful robes and nice toiletries. I was surprised at the total silence and slept soundly.

"Attention to detail! It was a dreamscape for an artist! I loved all the Dusen Dusen and fresh fruit and the bar upstairs! All the color!!
Walls were thin though as someone stayed next door and was on the phone and I could hear their whole conversation. Kinda bummed about that. And my shower leaked, the seal wasn’t good. Someone came to look at it but it still left the bathroom floor a wet mess. ",10,Abigail,2024-03-07
"Although rooms are small, they are very well appointed. Excellent TV, microwave, and refrigerator. The coffee which came with the room was very good, and instead of a crumby pod machine a pour over kettle was in the room. The staff was helpful and congenial. The ElNico rooftop restaurant was a nice surprise with very good food and beverages.

Love this hotel.  The rooms are very well thought out in terms of amenities. I ahd everything i needed.  I wouls definitely stay here again.,10,Chris,2024-02-29
"Where 2 begin? There are hidden “destination fees” (approx $30/eve) & when asked what they’re for, the front desk says “amenities.” I asked what the amenities are— He explained: fruit, tea, coffee, access to 11th floor rooftop, bikes. Of those ‘amenities,’ let’s discuss what you get: stale, HARD fruit; TWO tea bags for a 3-night stay (we requested more & never got them); no hot water cups. When I asked front desk for to-go cups, they said they don’t have them, even though there are to-go cups in the lobby each morning for coffee! We waited OVER AN HOUR for ice on 2 occasions & never received other items called for, including tea/creamers. When we checked in, there was NO hand soap in the bathroom.

After 2 nights, we hung the housekeeping sign on our door, indicating our room should be cleaned. No one cleaned it. When I asked again, they said there was nothing to do b/c housekeeping had left. They didn’t offer anything to rectify the issue (i.e. comp food/drink).They didn’t clean the trash outside our room; it was still there when we returned that eve. The 11th floor is lovely, but it’s open to the public, so there’s no “amenity.” The front desk, along with maintenance, housekeeping, etc. are unfriendly. We spent 5 minutes waiting for an Uber in the lobby & even though we were 5ft from the front desk, the employees gabbed & never had the courtesy to say “Good morning.”

The only employee worth commending is the night security woman. She’s kind/observant. Give her a raise.",2,Judith,2024-02-28

The hotel is under 10 mins from Bedford av and 5 mins to the L train so it’s perfectly located whether you are spending time exploring Williamsburg or using as a base for Manhattan.

"The main issue I had with it was that the fire alarm went off three separate tikes during my stay there. Once it even went off at 2:30am and everyone had to stand outside in the cold in various states of undress. Otherwise, outside of the shower smelling a little mildewy, the hotel condition was fine.",6,Ronald,2024-02-18

"Everything was great except that on Mondays the restaurant is closed so neither the grab and go breakfast nor the complementary coffee are available.
 Beyond that, on Monday you can’t even go to the rooftop to enjoy the marvelous view. 
On Tuesday morning we went up to take some picts and the access to the outside terrace was blocked, maybe because it is winter, besides, the complementary coffee run out and we were told that they will bring more but after more than 30 min waiting it never came. When we were leaving visibly upset, a staff member who was sat there for the entire time, told us she could make a machine coffee for us but it was too late. 
Beyond this, the room was excellent, comfortable and clean. Housekeeping, engineering, and front desk staff members were very welcoming and helpful. ",6,Carlos,2024-01-09

"This hotel is good for a night or two as it is in a prime Williamsburg location. Rooms are small but have a mini fridge and microwave. Bed was comfortable with nice Bellino linens. Also robes in rooms which I appreciate. What could have improved this stay was housekeeping. Each room is supposed to have coffee and tea. Upon check in coffee was not filled and there was only one tea bag. The water carafe and cup were dirty. There was only one roll of toilet paper and they never restocked it. In the bathroom there is a box that literally says extra toilet paper which was empty. I think if the GM did some additional trainings with housekeeping it would help elevate this property. 

Ps- it’s nice they allow dogs! ",8,Alyson,2023-12-28

"I chose this hotel because it's only 1 mile from my friends who live in Brooklyn. It was a great choice. The check-in was easy and I liked that the elevators require a key to go anywhere. I was on the 4th floor and although my view was of the building next to us, it still felt charming and let in enough light. The room itself was perfect for me -- I was in a queen room. I loved that the bulletin board had everything you need to know about the hotel arranged in cute post cards and graphics. It also felt nice to have real glasses, coffee pot, microwave and fridge in the room. The bathroom was also nice -- the water can build up on the ledge a bit in the shower but it was clean and everything had a place. 

I also really loved that el Nico restaraunt was on the roof. I dined inside and outside, and also had friends over for brunch. They loved the rooftop view as well. The staff at el Nico was great and the bar is fully stocked for anything you could possibly want. 

I'd stay here again. ",10,Christina,2023-10-07

Its proximity to Bedford Ave. afforded us delicious food options (special call-out to Martha's Country Bakery) and the vibe of lively neighborhood.
My only observation is I am currently working to obtain a breakdown of incidental charges as I did not receive any itemization, nor was any charge mentioned at check-out.  However, as I have some idea of the events for them, this is a very minor nit but simply offer to ask for any itemization at check-out... which was my oversight!",10,Andrew Michael,2023-08-23

"Pros: 
- easily walkable to L and G trains
- Awesome neighborhood
- place is clean and staff are very friendly and helpful
- hotel is trendy
- nice rooftop bar with view of Manhattan
- our room had a great view of Brooklyn

Cons:
- it seems like the shower door wasn't installed properly so it doesn't close. 
- the only ice is in your room fridge but our ice trays were covered in a layer of snowy freezer ice and looked like they hadn't been cleaned or refilled in a while. Luckily we had some dish soap with us so we cleaned ours and were able to make ice, but the hotel should do that more regularly and probably defrost the freezers.
- the in room pour over coffee is cool but they only provided 1 filter for 2 cups and 2 coffee portions. You can just ask the staff for more but I just found to weird. The coffee also is preground and not particularly fresh",8,Peter,2023-07-28

" This hotel would be good for a couple, but not great if three people. We had our teen daughter with us, who slept on the small sleeper couch. However, the sleeper couch was very uncomfortable. It also required five trips from housekeeping to get the sleeper couch bed fully made up. The staff didn’t know how to operate the sleeper couch (I finally did it for them myself), and a separate trip for linens, the. For blankets, then for pillows, etc. Very strange and not great.",6,Richard,2023-07-24

The staff-Ashley, Matt, Kaitlyn, Kat, Kelsey Fadi-all made my stay so comfortable and welcoming. They truly believe in customer service and it shows tremendously. Thank you all and see you soon!",10,Monique,2023-07-20

"A great place, a great price, and my new favorite hotel in Brooklyn!  The rooms are cozy, but very well-appointed.  Quiet, comfortable, and a perfect spot to get some much-needed rest after a long day in New York, yet very convenient to everything, including transit.",10,Rick,2023-07-13

"This was a pleasant stay overall. The best feature was how immaculately clean the room was thanks to the excellent cleaning staff. The people working the front desk were fine, especially the male staff. The female staff were a little moody but not rude. The location was outstanding to several interesting restaurants and other places of interest. I love how they offered free filtered water and fresh fruit (for a fee) any time of the day. You will need to use your room card to operate the elevators. The hotel is surprisingly quiet being so close to the freeway and having a popular rooftop bar. The lights are a little tricky in the room. Make sure the switch for the power is turned on or else nothing else can be turned on. Very easy to catch ride shares here as they will show up within 5 minutes.",8,Shawn,2023-07-08

"We wanted to have a dog friendly vacation in Williamsburg to walk around and get to the know the neighborhood. The Penny was the perfect place for this! The front desk management and staff were amazing. They loved on our dog, have her a bed and food/water bowls. It has an awesome roof top restaurant and was walking distance to so many great places. We even parked on the street for free and left the car there for the weekend. The hotel is hip and cute, has a great fenced backyard for the dogs and people having free coffee in the morning. They also sell fresh fruit salad and baked goods in the mornings. Can’t recommend the Penny enough. ",10,samantha,2023-06-24

"overall this was a great stay and i would return. a few negatives are horrible phone service so you MUST connect to the internet. Calls won't work. They also will not allow any later checkout, not even 30min. Hall ways are quite loud, anyone who says something in the hall you can absolutely hear, but we never heard our neighbors. Room was perfect for my BF and I, but you gottta make sure you are REALLY comfortable with each other, bc the bathroom is a fogged glass and yes you can hear EVERYTHING lol. also no plug in the bathroom, so if you are trying to do your hair you have to go into the main room and hope your cord is long enough. Pros, great design, impeccably clean, room service came every day, perfect location and we were able to easily find parking within a 5 min walk and the area is very safe. ",10,Tiffany,2023-06-06
"Although the space was small, I loved that the hotel used it to its advantage. Our favorite features were the window shades, the Chromecast addition on the TV, and the service. The only thing we didn't like about the experience was the shower. For some reason with the shower head in the middle, it caused water to leak out in the bath. Once we moved the shower head to the wall there was very little leakage. 

Also loved the rooftop bar, El Nico!",8,Ashley,2023-06-03

"The Penny was a great place to stay!!! Rooms were so smart in how they used space, provided great amenities (love the coffee and yoga mat, block and roller!). Really appreciated the suggested places to eat and enjoy. Incredible location!!!!! Was so easy to get around! Only suggestions for improvement are - sorting out light situation. Master switch meant total eclipse of the heart (darkness) or the closet light was left on. Also would strongly suggest you provide some tea bags. Will definitely recommend Penny and would stay there again.",8,Selina,2023-04-27
"This was my second time staying at the Penny and my stay was amazing both times!  Such a nice, safe area. Friendly, helpful staff and the rooms are really nice.  I slept really well and wasn't disturbed by outside noises.  The only thing I heard was the church bells chime every hour during the day but didn't notice them much. Really close to Bedford, Brooklyn Steel and the subway. I definitely recommend this hotel. Thank you to the staff for a wonderful stay.",10,Verified traveler,2023-04-27

"Room was compact but well-appointed. Love the coffee setup, the daily cleaning, the shower (and the products in the shower). The remote control blinds were a little odd — an instance of technology making things more complicated and less convenient than they would be without technology.

"The Penny is a mighty and chic hotel offering modest accommodations for city exploration. The compact design of their rooms allow for an easy visit and comfortable quarters. 

Travelers seeking larger rooms/suites, more privacy on property(very small lobby) or space with distance from other travelers may want to seek a more traditionally spacious property. 

After my 2nd stay at The Penny Williamsburg, I can say it is a great bang for your buck. Courteous and helpful staff add to its chic and fun charm. ",8,Alexander,2023-01-03

The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful, they offered us dog bowls and beds and brought us up ice. I would recommend booking a handicap accessible room if you are traveling with your dog because they provide a bit more space. The art work, beautiful robes, eco friendly toiletries, pour over coffee, and convenient room design made our stay extra special. It’s also close to McCarren Park, great music venues and restaurants.",10,Brandon,2023-01-02
