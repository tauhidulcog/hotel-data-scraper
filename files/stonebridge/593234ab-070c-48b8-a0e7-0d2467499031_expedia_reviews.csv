It was such an amazing stay. It was in a great location. Found our new favorite hotel to stay at in the city. ,10,Lisa,2025-09-11
People outside our room fought for over an hour and you could hear it all and when all other guests came back to their rooms you could hear all their conversations as if they were standing beside us in our room ,6,Lori,2025-09-05
Stay was great and very accessible to everything.,10,Joshua,2025-08-31
Very good spot if you want to be close to SoHo for your shopping session and there’s a lot of good restaurants nearby. I really enjoyed my stay and the staff was friendly and welcoming ,6,olivier,2025-08-26

"The property was nice and quiet! We were there for the night and it was walkable distance of the places we wanted to go. Staff were very nice (especially the woman who allowed me to go back into the room to retrieve an item I left in the room). No bar soap for hand washing but they left double of shampoos, conditioners, body wash and lotion. I would recommend if you need to stay in the area. ",8,Shellie,2025-06-30

"Their phones don’t work, so don’t expect to reach anyone at the front desk. I was there Wednesday through Friday and their phones were ‘down’ the whole time.
At times there is also no one at the front desk, so just wait and eventually someone will show up.
The magnetic cards stop working as soon as they are even near a phone, very inconvenient, especially when nobody is at the reception to recode the cards.",6,johann von,2025-05-17
"God placering og super venligt personale.
Værelserne er alt for små til en familie på 4. To senge, Max. 160 cm brede som knapt nok kunne være i værelset. Vi rejste kun med 2 tasker og den ene måtte mases ned mellem sengene så vi kravlede henover dem. 
Badeværelset er fint og rent. Der skiftes håndklæder hver dag, lækkert men unødvendigt, hvilket er årsagen til den lave miljø rating. Der er støj fra gadens barer og der kører mange biler med høj musik om aftenen, men hotellet tilbyder ørepropper, så for os var det ikke et problem. 
Gardiner og vinduer er dog meget beskidte, men ikke slemt for NYC i den prisklasse.

"The double room was very small where you need to move luggage around to access the bathroom. Would not recommend for more than 2 people. The shower tap was upside down which meant you either had boiling hot or cold water, no warm water. There was a constant banging noise coming from the bathroom.

"Location! Location! Great place to stay, you’re close to the subway, food, coffee and shops. The hotel is good, has everything you could need if you don’t plan to be there a lot. The rooms are pretty small and old but it was perfect for our quick weekend trip. We only came back to sleep and left early in the morning each day! Would recommend!",8,Michell,2024-12-13
"Avoid this hotel at all costs—terrible experience from start to finish.

This was hands down the worst hotel stay I’ve ever had. Upon arrival, I was given a room on the main floor with paper-thin walls. I could hear every check-in conversation and every complaint made at the front desk. When I asked to be moved, the night staff claimed the hotel was sold out and offered me earplugs as a solution.

The next morning, I spoke with a different front desk agent who assured me they would move me to a room upstairs. I left my bags with them for the day, expecting a resolution. When I returned that evening, I encountered the same staff member from the night before, who informed me that not only was I not moved but I had also been checked out entirely.

To make matters worse, they were using my room to store luggage for a large, noisy group that was crowded into the tiny lobby. After some confusion, the staff realized there was an available room upstairs after all, and I was moved. They offered to waive the $15-per-night facility fee (on top of the $400 per night I was paying) as compensation, which felt like a slap in the face.

The nightmare didn’t end there. My new room was plagued by loud, repetitive banging all night, which sounded like pipes hitting against each other. Needless to say, I got no sleep.

To top it off, I never received an emailed receipt upon checkout, and the hotel’s photos online are heavily edited—the rooms look nothing like the",2,Eiron,2024-12-13

The staff was really nice and helpful! The only thing that you need to be aware of is that even though a room is advertised with two double beds you end up with two single beds. This is very uncomfortable considering the maximum capacity for a double room is 4 people. I don’t know if that’s a translation mistake within the booking process of the app or just a money grab. Nevertheless the hotel was okay for a short stay. ,6,Jean-Noel,2024-10-20
"This hotel is false advertising. 
I would like to start by saying the hotel staff were very nice and the hotel was mostly clean.

The pictures of the hotel show rooms that are much larger and in better condition than the room we had. We were in room 102. 
There were so many things wrong with the room that I can’t include them all in this review. The peep hole in the door was broken and had tissue shoved in it. The noise from the front desk and the elevator made sleep difficult. There was no space for luggage. There was no place to hang close. The faucet in the bathroom was loose. There was no toilet lid, so when you flush the room gets sprinkled… ew. The sink has no counter space so any thing you try to place one the sink may fall into the toilet. Shower curtain instead of a door. The latch on the window to the courtyard was broken this seem unsafe on the ground floor. The tv cords looked like a blind person installed them.
One outlet cover was broken and another was covered in tape… oh I tried to iron a shirt and the iron was covered in some black goo. I was irony a white shirt to go to a broadway show.
 The front desk had to replace the iron. The ironing board is a table top ironing board but there is no table so I had to use the bed. There is no space for two people in the room. When one person was walking the other had to be on the bed. The bed is crammed in the corner. If you are the person closest to the wall you have to craw over the other person to go to the bathroom.",2,John,2024-10-20
It was my first trip to NYC and this hotel did not disappoint.  It was small but clean and the four of us were able to share the space comfortably. The hotel has great cafes around it and is very close to the subway station. The view from the terrace at the top of the hotel has amazing views of the city.  The staff was very welcoming and helpful!  I would highly recommend this hotel!,10,Nicole,2024-10-19

"I chose this hotel because it was in a perfect location to where I wanted to be at. Nice staff. The floor we were on had only two rooms which felt safe and comfortable. I had 0 noise issues. Slept great at night. Only thing I noticed, there water damage on doors. Some furniture had missing knobs on the drawers and picture frames glass was broken. Room was definitely small but was not an issue for my friend and I. We only were in the room to sleep and freshen up for our time there. ",10,Anay,2024-10-02

We had no shampoo in the room, there was an ironing board but no iron. Room was quiet, beds were comfortable and shower was great! They have complimentary coffee and some snacks in the basement level. 

Very close to a subway station and is next to Bel Fries, which is worth stopping at for a late night snack or lunch! Be ready for a wait :)

"Fairly good location - two blocks away from Katz's Delicatessen. Some clubs are nearby, so the area is busy even in the evening. Our room was on the ground floor, so it was rather noisy. The bathroom was accessible (we didn't need this type of accomodations), so you need to ask for extra towels to make a barrier for water, otherwise when showering the water flows to the room floor.
Nice view of the city from the patio on the 6th floor (I only found out about it by chance).
No breakfast, but they have a good coffee downstairs and some selection of tea bags.",8,Iskander,2024-08-21

"Overall the room was clean and furniture was in good shape, but the lack of space made it impossible to get comfortable. Only one person could walk around at a time due to the lack of space between the beds and wall. There was no closet, no counter space, lack of outlets, no place to store suitcase, and the floors were not clean. Hairs on the bathroom floor. The air conditioning was a wall unit. Hard to ever get the temperature right and always felt damp. Strangely there were only sheets on the bed. We had to request a comforter/top blanket. There also was no hair dryer, had to request that as well. Just lots missing and no space, but I loved the location.",4,Anne,2024-07-27

"Honestly for what we needed it served it’s purpose. Small but functional bathroom and bedroom. Biggest problem was single pane windows. It sounds like the window was wide open all night. It’s a vibrant community, with heavy Summer season construction. Being so close to excellent restaurants and bars is a draw for us. We were prepared for a bit of noise. We live in downtown Toronto and are used to a similar neighbourhood experience. That being said we woke up every morning at 630am to noisy construction, and you could hear conversations at street level from 5 floors up. Nice Reno to the interior. Replacing the windows would go miles for improving experience.",8,Elizabeth,2023-06-10

"Very conveniently located close to Delancey/Essex St Subway station (handy for travel from JFK) and roughly midway between the Empire State Building and the Battery, making most sites of the city within walkable distance for those who like to explore on foot. The hotel staff were very friendly and the condition of the building fine, if the corridors were a little spartan and the metal bathroom shelf a little institutional. There is even a pleasant roof terrace though the view from it was hardly spectacular. In any case, this is not a hotel in which to linger because it is surrounded with life. The bed was very comfortable indeed and the selection of tv channels better than in many hotels, though the thin curtain/blind did not block as much light as might be desired and the room featured neither a hairdryer nor any tea/coffee making facilities. The neighbourhood is lively at night, but this did not disturb me in the room. All in all, I felt this was a good value hotel by NYC standards and would certainly consider staying again if on my own, though if treating a partner I might seek a few more frills.",10,Neil,2023-05-11

Easy to get to from JFK with the subway. Small rooms, nowhere to hang your clothes or put your bags, we were 4 and had small bags which made it work. A very noisy area, especially during weekends- wear earplugs when sleeping if you get A room facing the street. A plus for free coffee in the morning and the price is affordable with very nice staff.

Front desk staff was courteous and tried to be helpful. Bed very comfortable.

The location is ideal as there is a subway station one block away (Line F-Essex-Delancey).  The room was not cleaned up daily once for elevator crew could not get to the room. The rooms are as described.  It's a no frills hotel.  The front desk staff were all very friendly and accommodating.   I believe they could use some work with general housekeeping and towels daily. ,6,Pete,2023-01-05
"Room was very dirty, nail clippings and lord know what esle under the beds.  Family room with two double beds;;;;; this is if you a family of midgets. Also no room for the a families suitcases. We changes hotels after the first night to a much nicer less expensive and larger hotel just down the block.
The advantage of our night in the Redford was the neighbour having a canabis party so we all got high for free on their fumes. ( Not to sure the kids enjoyed this experience )",2,Stephen,2023-01-03
