"Love this place. It has been very convenient to stay here while my apartment gets worked on. Bonus that I have a safe, homey place where my parrots can be until apartment is ready. Close to trains, 4 stops from my own apartment. This area (Court Square) in LIC is very up and coming. Even 10 yrs ago, it wasnt like this. Several trains into Queens and 1 stop into Manhattan. Grocery stores, restaraunts, coffee and tea places - with Asian food being predominant. Its great! Hotel employees are wonderful, helpful and friendly. Clean comfy rooms. If I ever have friends visiting, I will always have them dtay at Aloft.",10,Nora,2025-08-22
"This was our first time staying here.  Long Island City is nice, we walked all over the place to dinner, for drinks, and transportation was easy from the front door.  The staff was friendly, room was quiet, clean and a lovely bed.  Water pressure in the shower was among the best I have ever had in a hotel.  Very pleased, we will return.  ",10,David,2025-08-21

"I live in Astoria; but staying here while my apartment gets worked on. This hotel is really great, rooms comfortable and quiet; ALL staff wonderful. The neighborhood is very upcoming. It has numerous places to eat, there is a mini Target and Trader Joes nearby; several Asian supermarkets in hood and good restaraunts. Multi coffee places too. Even a ""hipster"" book shop. It is close to multiple subway lines (7, N, R, E). VERY close to Manhattan.The only thing I would wish for is a microwave in the room. There is one of those standard single coffee makers and fridge in room; but a microwave would be extra great. To heat anything, one has to take elevator to the lobby. One washer and drier is on premises which is great for me. Small, comfy bar in lobby and court yard to sit outside. Coffees, tea and snacks available for purchase in lobby. The facility has a rooftop view of the city for tourists. Perhaps the best thing for me in choosing and extending my stay twice is that this hotel is PET FRIENDLY. So, my three little parrots are nice and comfy staying here. The blackout curtains stops them from calling to and waking me (and other guests) at 6 am. The prices are fair, given other hotels and the proximity to Manhattan. I think this is a top find! Excellent hotel. ",10,Nora,2025-08-09

"I love the modern look of the hotel. The bed was comfy and everything that I needed in my room was there: a safe, iron, television. The location is superb! I used to live 2 blocks over so the location was ideal to me and close to the subway and various stores and restaurants. The only complaint is the NOISE. When people enter/exit their rooms, I could hear their doors slam every time! And the noise from the street traffic is horrific, but that's common in NYC if you don't have sound-proof windows! There was construction going on across the street, but I really didn't hear it because I was gone during the day. The good thing is that the hotel was able to provide me with ear plugs and I slept soundly. ",10,Shelly,2025-07-23
"It was a fun filled weekend in NY for us. Aloft was clean and convenient. Staff was efficient and polite but there was ""above or beyond"" customer service and that was Ok with us. I would definitely recommend if you are independent enough to ask for what u need and move on with your day. 
P.s. not much of a Mahattan view from ""terrace or room"" at least feom the 6th floor. I would still recommend to anyone easy-going to want a clean room to relax, rest and then head out for the day.",8,Amanda,2025-07-22

"Arrived around 8 pm . We were given room 210. The room is directly above the bar and outdoor private event area. It was so loud we couldn‚Äôt sleep. I went to the lobby to complain and was told that the hotel was completely booked, however, people were checking in at that very time. On the following day it was the same thing loud music and partying until 1130 pm. It‚Äôs a nice hotel, however, if they attempt to give you a room on the second or third floor on the courtyard side I would suggest you refuse. ",4,Thomas,2025-07-13

"I had the pleasure of spending three nights at Aloft Long Island, and I must say, it was a wonderful experience from beginning to end. Right from my check-in, the staff were incredibly efficient, making the process smooth and hassle-free, which I truly appreciated after our long trip.

We were attending an event, and the hotel's location was just perfect for that. I selected Aloft based on its proximity to various destinations, and it exceeded my expectations.

The hotel exudes a modern, vibrant atmosphere, and my room was not only clean but also comfortable and stylish.

One of the standout moments for me was enjoying the stunning city view from the rooftop.

I was impressed by the attention to detail in every aspect, from the friendly service to the thoughtful amenities. I‚Äôd like to extend a special thank you to our room attendant, Yennifer M., for her exceptional service.

Without a doubt, I would choose to stay here again and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone visiting the area!",10,Tiziana,2025-06-08

"Very poorly built hotel which is fairly new property.  Ceiling patches all over and uneven, shoddy job on wallpaper and construction with just about everything.  Window shades are a joke. Cheap sub standard finishesüëéüëé. Best part is i reserved king room and was given double beds room and had to change rooms and was given a garbage accessible room.  Paid $400 even though I just looked online and see rooms for $180. Next time build it Union and it will be built right or Dont build it in NYC

Will not be back and don't plan to stay at any marriott hotels unless they are top if the line hotels.  Just realized room was built with wall unit AC- (note to property owner its 2025 and this is NYC!)  I work nearby and wont be back. Nor will any of my 500 employees.

"We wanted a hotel near the city (NYC), and also in LIC near two events we were attending during our short 2-day stay, that wouldn't ""break the bank"".  Aloft LIC worked out *perfectly*.

All Within an 8-minute walk:
- SO many places to get Ramen
- SO many places to get Sushi
- Bakeries, Markets, Bars
- Trains to NYC 

This hotel was clean, modern, with super-friendly front-desk staff who held our bags as we grabbed a morning breakfast before checking out.  And worth mentioning -- their deal with the parking garage (2 minute walk) made our parking rate like.. HALF, and about $20/day.  Nice!

All good things to say -- would definitely recommend",10,Robert,2025-03-03

"Bel√§get vid t-bana Queens Plaza, en station fr√•n Manhattan. Mycket smidigt. Modernt och fr√§scht hotell.  Utm√§rkt gym i k√§llaren. Ingen skillnad i pris j√§mf√∂rt med Manhattans hotell men b√§ttre standard vilket kan vara v√§rt att efterstr√§va. Plus n√•got st√∂rre rum med ok utrymme f√∂r resv√§skor och t.o.m lite g√•yta. End. dubbelrum finns med Manhattan view, men ej i familjerum f√∂r 4 pers. En besvikelse eftersom vi bokade rum med Manhattan view vilket inte gick att korrigera n√§r det uppt√§cktes vid ankomst. Manhattan View i rubriken f√∂rvirrar. Familjerummet tittar rakt in i baksidans bygge. Hade √§ven uppskattat att f√• veta att detta √§r ett Marriott hotell d√• det st√•r f√∂r kvalitet. Fotot i hotellbeskrivningen √§r m√•nga √•r gammalt, taget fr√•n takterassen och borde ha bytts ut g√∂r l√§nge sen. En stor del av ""Manhattan View"" √§r f√∂rbyggt sen dess. Hotellet bjuder p√• te & n√•got slags kaffe p√• rummet. En vatteflaska/dag/boende serveras ocks√•. Det finns frukost att best√§lla p√• hotellet fr√•n meny. Annars finns lokala butiker och restauranger i omr√•det f√∂r alla m√•ltider. Vi uppskattade att bo i ett omr√•de med vardagsliv och ""vanligt"" folk p√• v√§g till jobb och skola som en del av resan. Hotellst√§dningen var v√§ldigt bra.",8,Verified traveler,2025-02-28

"Everything about the Aloft was great.  Check-in was a breeze, and the room was perfect!  Not big, but room for everything.  Bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom was a nice size.  My only very minor complaint was that the channel selection on the TV wasn‚Äôt great (no ESPN???).  But that‚Äôs a very small complaint.  Location was also perfect - subway was half a block away, a really good parking garage was also close (highly recommend the Spot Hero app), and lots of great bars and restaurants are nearby.

But they‚Äôve promoted the location like they have a spectacular view in the rooftop and they don‚Äôt have it , the view was my only reason to book that hotel, you only can see buildings but nothing like the pictures. But overall the stay was ok , a bit over price; we stayed there for 9 days and cleaning staff weren‚Äôt cleaning every day there was always missing something and we ended up going to the front desk many times.  There is really nice restaurants close by and the subway station is like 2 minutes away walking, they old Pepsi sign is like15 min walking .",6,susana,2025-01-11

"This was my second time staying here with my S/O, however the room was a little odd in minor situations. The mini fridge was under the bathroom sink and there wasn‚Äôt a microwave the room. Also, when you turn on the shower, there‚Äôs a weird odor almost sewage like which goes away but it happens every time you turn on the shower. This was in room 612. The heater wasn‚Äôt all that to rave about so y‚Äôall might wanna update or fix that. The pool table in the lobby was nice to use tho and the coffee maker was clutch in the room. Back to the room, the layout was kinda odd since the toilet and shower was in the same room, separate from the sink. The location was great since there‚Äôs 3 different train stations in the area. ",8,Devin,2025-01-06
"During my stay at this hotel, I encountered several issues that significantly impacted the experience. The most concerning aspect was the lack of proper cleanliness. Common areas appeared neglected, and the room itself showed signs of insufficient upkeep, with dust, stains, and general disrepair noticeable upon arrival.

Additionally, the value for the price paid did not align with the quality of service and amenities provided. The rates suggest a higher standard, but the experience fell short of expectations. Attention to detail and improved maintenance are necessary to justify the current pricing structure.

While the location may offer convenience, I would recommend exploring other accommodations until the hotel addresses these fundamental concerns.",4,Roberto,2025-01-04

"Departing from some reviews of the street facing rooms and construction in front of the building; noise isn‚Äôt as bad, it really goes on the guest if you are easily woken up by any type of noise, construction is still going on, but again, if you are planning on staying all day in your room then it‚Äôs a different story. Based on our experience, room was clean, room serviced daily, staff was very accommodating and helpful at check-in. Conveniently located, easy access to public transportation and local restaurants.",10,Alejandro,2024-12-04

This place was great! It‚Äôs conveniently close to subway stations and surrounded by plenty of restaurants. The staff was very welcoming and accommodating‚Äîthey held our bags after checkout so we could explore the city some more before our flight. The breakfast options were convenient and decently priced. The room was clean and I especially liked the Dry Bar shampoo/conditioner/body wash. My one critique would be the shower as it was just the floor and no barrier to hold the water in so it kind of got everywhere. We built a barrier with towels that seemed to work but was rather odd that the water would just gather and slowly find its way down the drain. It wasn‚Äôt anything so deterring to not stay here again. I would absolutely stay here the next time I‚Äôm in town!,10,Sydney,2024-11-25

I got to the hotel very early. It was too early to check in but I said I wanted a quiet room. When I returned I was told that my room was not quiet but there were no other rooms available. There was construction noise going on at 8pm. I talked to the front desk who told me it was over. It clearly was not and I told him that I could see people doing work. He said it would end immediately. It did not. If you are on a low floor facing the street it is insanely loud here. I would not recommend it.,2,Christopher,2024-11-13

"Das A Loft Long Island ist ein sch√∂nes, zweckm√§√üiges Hotel, welches gut gelegen ist um Manhattan zu erkunden.
Die U- Bahn Station befindet sich in 200 m Entfernung und ist auch mit einem Fahrstuhl erreichbar. So ist man in K√ºrze in Manhattan.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, und es gibt eine mini Fr√ºhst√ºcks pantry im Eingangsbereich an der man sich  etwas Obst , Joghurt etc kaufen kann.
In der n√§heren Umgebung gibt es aber auch einen kleinen Deli, einen Supermarkt ( Direkt an der U-Bahn Station und auch einen Target in ca 500 m Entfernung. 
Die Zimmer sind ordentlich, mit Klima Anlage und kleinem K√ºhlschrank ausgestattet und sauber.
Das Housekeeping ist findet fast jeden Tag statt, (einmal wurde mein Zimmer leider vergessen) spricht aber leider nur spanisch. 
Einziger negativer Aspekt ist , das in der Beschreibung stand das Zimmer habe einen Safe, der war leider nicht vorhanden.
Gro√üartig ist die Dachterrasse im 18. Stock, von der aus man einen atemberaubenden Blick auf die Skyline hat und sowohl zum Sonnenuntergang als auch Abends wundersch√∂ne Fotos machen kann.

"Checked in for two nights while I was moving across the street into a luxury building thinking the rooms were going to be decent. I booked a Manhattan view and received a Cheeto smelling room facing construction. When I went down to kindly ask the gentlemen working overnight he said I did not book a Manhattan view I proceeded to show him I did in fact book a manahattan view then he responded with well they‚Äôre all the same that‚Äôs just the name while he shoved food in his mouth. He switched my room the same exact room. I then contacted Expedia and the hotel to cancel my second night since I would not be using it especially after this customer service, I was told I was ok to check out in the morning and they would contact the property for a refund. I checked out the next morning but was still charged for two nights a complete waste of money. Don‚Äôt stay here I don‚Äôt know how they have so many stars.

Good room with nice area ,10,Pataramon,2023-11-12
"I stayed for 4 nights and out of that time my room was only cleaned once after repeatedly mentioning it. After the first day and my room wasn‚Äôt cleaned, I needed to call down for more towels. I mentioned my room wasn‚Äôt cleaned and if it could be cleaned the next morning while I was out, I was told sure no problem. I also mentioned my allergies of dust and that is the reason I need my room cleaned. I come back my room still isn‚Äôt cleaned. The day of check out I woke up with hives over my face due to allergic reactions. I noticed that there was large clumps of dust all over the bed coming from the top of the bed that hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in weeks(I have pictures). I mentioned this to the front desk manager and told her I‚Äôm looking for a partial reiumbursement. She said she completely understood and someone would be calling me that day to discuss. No call. Then I called the next day and was unable to speak to anyone, so I left a voicemail. No return call. I call the day after that, no one knew what I was talking about and then created a ticket for the hotel to call me. No one has yet to call me. ",2,Shayla,2023-10-28
"It was just perfect. I got a king bedroom on the 14th floor and the view was nice. You also get roof access. The bar crew on Friday was fun. Happy hour, karaoke, food...so much fun! There is access to a lot of stores and an Asian restaurant next door that closes at 2 am. The subway is not far at all. No need to take Lyft. Just learn to take the subway. ",10,Nomvuyo,2023-10-21
"This hotel cannot successfully handle room management and security. They issued me the wrong key, then fixed it, then 30 minutes later someone else was coming in my room having been issued the same key. You have one job ",4,Jesse,2023-10-21

"The front desk staff was amazing! Not only was I greeted with smiles, all of them were more than willing nd able to help with every little question I had. Loved the roof top lounge, I just wish there was a smoking area - but I understand. Also, I wish there were more breakfast options included, but there is a lovely cafe 2 doors down. I don't know if you all have any say or pull with the bar staff, but OMG! those ladies are exceptional! I'd appreceiate it if you could spread the message.",10,Corliss,2023-10-02

"I booked way ahead of time, but they overbooked. They then turned us away when I arrived for check in at 11 pm. I had to book another hotel far away in the middle of the night. Inhumanness. ",2,Subah,2023-07-06
"The hotel is amazing, clean and modern. The staff are friendly and extremely helpful! Very close to the subway, will take you into Manhattan, Brooklyn or out to Queens. The rooftop deck offers amazing views. The only negative is that there is a lot of construction in the area. Monday though Saturday expect it to begin at 7 am. You will get a break on Sunday. Area is great, clean and safe day and night. I highly recommend! ",10,Charles,2023-06-27

"Un h√¥tel particuli√®rement bien situ√© √† proximit√© des transports en commun. Manhattan accessible en 10 minutes, superbe vue depuis la chambre et le rooftop, personnel tr√®s agr√©able.
Le seul b√©mol se trouve au niveau du bruit, c‚Äôest NYC. On entend un peu le m√©tro au loin, mais rien de grave. Le frigo faisait un petit peu de bruit dans la chambre.
Dans l‚Äôensemble, de tr√®s tr√®s belles prestations, un bar avec des barmaids tr√®s sympathiques et vivantes qui savent mettre l‚Äôambiance. Nous y reviendrons sans h√©siter !",10,Quentin,2023-05-23

"I liked the fitness center, I like their excellent service.",10,JAMES DELORN,2023-04-04
"Aloft is a lovely hotel, with great amenities for its size‚Ä¶a great bar, breakfast items for purchase, a pool table, outdoor area, gym, and rooftop area to enjoy the skyline.  Upon arriving (at about 5:45pm) our room wasn‚Äôt ready yet so we had to wait 1/2 hour.  It was the only room left with two beds.  I specifically called the evening before to confirm my reservation and would have been upset if it wasn‚Äôt available!  We went to the bar.  The desk clerk gave us money off our first night and our drinks were on the house.  That was very thoughtful!  The room was nice but was an accessible room (not mentioned at the desk).  The room was nice-sized but I do have to say that construction is happening right next door so at about 7am the sound of very loud banging wakes you up.  It‚Äôs the location of that room; not all rooms hear that.  There is also construction across the street.  But that‚Äôs NYC/LIC!!  Many wonderful eateries to choose from in the area.  All in all, I will definitely stay there again!  ",8,Bonnie,2023-03-23
Quick checkin. Great view off patio. Nice high tech digital thermostat. Super comfortable bed. Great pillows (always get lumping oversized pillows - these were perfect. Great size for a NYC hotel room and 2 blocks in either direction from major subway hubs. Shower pressure was non existent to the point of causing a longer shower it was so slow.
