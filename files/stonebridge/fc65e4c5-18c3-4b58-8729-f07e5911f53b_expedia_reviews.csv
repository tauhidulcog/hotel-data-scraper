"I liked that it was conveniently located.  i did not like that they did not have housekeeping each day, or even every other day.  We checked in on Tuesday, left on Saturday, had to ask for clean towels.",6,Rita,2025-10-06
"Awesome room, other than given the wrong keys and having to wait on our anniversary. The staff was very friendly but gave me the wrong keys and the wrong food on my order. They had a lot of shops near by and the gym was awesome. The hotel needs to do better but the attitudes were amazing. The people were so nice ",2,Rene,2025-10-05

Once we parked our car didn’t move again until it was time to leave. We walked everywhere, very convenient location.

The property was nice and comfortable.  The team was very attentive and continued to ask how the stay is going.  I did get charged for $38 of something in the Mini Bar no one is able to determine what it was since I do not drink alcohol or did not open the bar at all … ,10,Larry,2025-09-21

"This was our second stay in New Orleans at the Le Meridian. There are a lot of positive points here but a few misses service wise during this stay. Here are the positives: most of the staff is very friendly. Great location outside the craziness of the French Quarter but only a short walk away. Free morning coffee service in lobby is great. Nice selection of food available for breakfast or later on in the day with drinks from the bar. Here’s the misses: awful in room coffee. Fake powdered creamer with a pod of coffee in a mini coffee maker. Not good. The lobby and front desk are cashless. The small sundries shop is self serve only. Several items would not scan. Very frustrating. I saw people just walking away and not paying because they couldn’t scan anything. If you are going to force a guest to scan their merchandise, please make sure all items UPC codes actually work!! I wanted to leave cash tips for housekeeping and other staff but since they are cashless, I had to walk to a convenience store to break down bigger bills. Overall, we would stay here again. Walkable to the Superdome and French Quarter. If you like to gamble, it’s right across from Caesar’s. 20 minute walk to WW2 museum. I just wish they would fine tune some things here to make it even better!",8,Randolph,2025-09-16

"This is a long-time, well known property of Downtown New Orleans. The aesthetic and staff were nice, especially Vegas (bartender) and AJ (bell man), but common areas were not clean. There were stains on lounge chairs, rodents seen running into/under the bar and patio area. Food also subpar (freezer burned chicken, etc.).",6,Meca,2025-09-15

"If I could give this property zero stars I would.  Two  40+ women travelers experience from DC Area.  Day 1: Upon check-in, at 1am there was a party next door and we asked to be moved we get moved to a handicap accessible room, the sheets were horrible the toilet has urine around the base, we make do assume housekeeping will address the next day. Day 2: Toilet stops up they send engineer to fix he leaves toilet water all over the bathroom, we ask for it to be cleaned he cleans the floor then uses the same towel to clean the toilet seat, I then just ask him to give me Clorox wipes and I can do it myself. Urine still around base of toilet.  Day 3: Roach is in the bathroom we kill it ask to be moved we are then put back in a handicap accessible room, this is important because the beds are frames only one foot off the ground and I cut myself on the frame in the new room, we were told we could “get” $75 worth of food at bar as a credit but I realized today that I was charged $75 so the offer from the manager Breeon Johnson was just offering my own money as it was the daily resort fee.  She then states I will get a night and a half back and I get only $100 refund for 3 days at a 1 star motel cosplaying as a 4 start do yourself a favor stay elsewhere.  Hotel is for a fun night with locals not exclusive, quiet, clean or comfortable.  I have the pictures that I can post…",2,Amanda J,2025-09-14

"Only 1 elevator was working this entire weekend which was terrible long wait times and had to go on every floor.  It was very inconvenient to get at bar each time. The entrance to the room is obstructed and causes safety concerns. Failure in the check and balance system due to the first room that was given was not was  prepared for new guests. The air conditioning was working prpperly. Pictures of the pool on the website was very deceiving, was expecting a bigger pool.",4,Melissa Del,2025-09-07

"Unfortunately, southern hospitality was low after checking in. The hotel is beautiful to what meets the eye but the sheets wouldn’t stay on the bed, there was hair on the mattress, the toilet drained loudly and often. For the convenient location and price I would stay again but not for the amenities at all. Everything is small, the bar area, shower, pool, etc. SMALL. We had the corner suite and I love a beautiful view so that was nice as well. ",6,Decorah,2025-09-01

"Disappointed with my stay. I booked 2 nights on Expedia for about $360, but at checkout my bill was $597 after surprise fees. Valet parking was $52 per night + tax with no clear disclosure that it was the only option. The $25/day resort fee was supposed to be a food credit, but the restaurant staff had no idea how to apply it, and I never saw the credit.

Rooms were also much smaller than advertised, and it felt like the hotel charged for every little thing. Location and style were nice, but the lack of transparency and hidden charges ruined the experience. Not worth the price.",4,Amitta,2025-09-01

"During my stay at this hotel, I experienced ongoing AC issues. In the first room, the air conditioning was not working properly and there was also a noticeable odor. Maintenance attempted to address the problem, but we were eventually moved to another room. While the second room was somewhat cooler, the AC still did not function at full capacity.

Later, while in the elevator, I overheard another guest expressing her frustration with the same issue—she mentioned she had already been moved three times due to AC problems. This made it clear that the situation was not isolated to my room but rather a broader hotel issue. Unfortunately, the hotel never confirmed whether there were system-wide AC problems.

I do want to acknowledge Billy and Coco, who made an effort to accommodate us by arranging room changes and offering assistance. However, despite their efforts, the air conditioning problems persisted throughout my stay.",6,Verified traveler,2025-08-25

We asked for an additional wash cloth, was told someone would bring it up but no one ever brought it. However, the man who checked us out waived our resort fee to make up for it. That was nice of him. Other than that, everything was great! I would stay there again because the location is perfect!",8,Kristin,2025-08-23

Our room was not spacious at all, bathroom was not spacious, the room smelt like cigarettes the whole weekend, the smell comes through the vents, the linen smelt mildew, a/c did not work, refrigerator did not work, bathroom sink barely gives out water, we waited in valet 30-45 min each time.

I’ve stayed at this property several times and never noticed such an itemized list of fees. Theres an extra charge at every turn. My first room this visit was very underwhelming. Being a Bonvoy member I was upgraded to a room with a broken toilet. I discovered this after use and I was very embarrassed. I don’t think I will be revisiting the establishment. ,6,John,2025-08-12

"From the moment I arrived at Le Méridien New Orleans, I felt welcomed. The staff was friendly, attentive, and quick with check-in, setting the tone for a great stay. The hotel’s modern, stylish design gave it an upscale yet approachable vibe.

The room was spotless, with a bed that felt like sleeping on a cloud perfect after a day exploring the city. The linens were fresh, pillows plentiful, and the blackout curtains ensured uninterrupted rest.

The location couldn’t be better just a short walk to the French Quarter, the streetcar line, and countless restaurants and attractions. For those relying on rideshare or taxis, pickups were seamless right outside the lobby.

Food options at the on-site restaurant and bar were delicious, and breakfast was fresh and satisfying. The rooftop pool was a nice bonus, offering a relaxing escape with a great view. Internet access was fast and reliable, making it easy to plan outings or stream a movie at night.

Le Méridien combined style, comfort, and convenience perfectly. I’d stay here again in a heartbeat and highly recommend it to anyone visiting New Orleans.",10,David,2025-08-11
"I'm giving this hotel 1 star overall because they really got me messed up. They held A LOT of my money and I still don’t have a clear reason why. First room had a cracked bathroom ceiling, water literally dripped on my head while brushing my teeth. The cabinet over the fridge was off its hinge. Engineer and front desk woman was awesome in moving me to a new room, but no one should’ve been given that room. I’ve been a loyal Expedia member for over a decade and always book in advance expecting to only pay for incidentals and destination fees. Instead, I was charged $280 the first night, $151 the second, and $100 more on my checkout day — that’s $531 in holds for a 3-night stay! I was told the second charge was a “mistake” and that incidentals were supposed to be $100/night, charged each night, but I was mistakenly charged upfront. I was fine with that — I'd be paying it anyway, but the extra charges made no sense. I had a $650 budget and this blew past it. Only the manager could give answers, and he assured me my card would be removed from the system. Clearly not, since another $100 hit my account after checkout today. I had an $87 bar tab, but they already held $151! The “use it or lose it” destination fee pushes you to spend at the bar, which then triggers more holds — it feels like a setup. Positives: Staff were excellent (10/10), food was great, bed was comfortable, but the elevators were consistently dirty — never seemed to be cleaned. I won’t stay here again. Stressful.",2,Jocelyn,2025-08-11

Each staff member was friendly, & provided SUPERIOR customer service! Our travel to New Orleans was bumpy to say the least but our stay at Le Meridian was really the rainbow after the storm! We’ll definitely be back to stay here again minus the Frontier flight! Our only suggestion would be to have a refrigerator in the room. We brought food back from the restaurants we ate at but had to throw them away as we could not keep them cold. Other than that, we had a wonderful stay here. The bed was a dream too!

"I've visited this hotel several of times. Unfortunately this experience was terrible. We were bot able to get access to our room before check in time of 4pm ( which has never been a problem before), the first elevator bounced continuously leaving us stranded on the second floor. Once we got off that elevator, we decided ti try another, abd that elevator door wouldn't close. Our room was on the 18th floor so no stair climbing there. The 3rd elevator sounded like the cables were going to break. Once we got to the room, the tv said a completely different name. I called downstairs to make sure we werent given the wrong room. Front desk confirmed it was the right room, but never made the change. Its the little things for me. There was lipstick on the light switch in the bathroom and the sink leaked. The ac was set to 60, but it felt like 80. The bedding was horrible. It just wasnt what we've experience before. ",6,Jessica,2025-06-23

Was able to check in early which was great and allowed me to enjoy my first day more. Had noisy neighbors the last night that partied the whole time. Upon check out a man that I believe worked there tried to grab my roller bag out of my hand when I did not ask for help nor make it seem like I needed help. I was just trying to check out. After asking the man to stop touching my bag the women at the front desk had a little attitude and made a comment that I must be in a hurry. She then butchered my very french last name on my email which was funny for it being New Orleans. Awkward end but the room was really nice. ,8,Erin,2025-06-02

"Good location, nice & relaxing lobby and court yard. 
Upon check in great customer service— we proceeded to our room (on the 6 floor) as we heard loud noise from car speakers & looked out the window only to notice we “DID NOT” receive the River view as stated on the reservation. Husband later went to the front desk was issued another room on the 14th floor  still NOT the view we were expecting or had paid for —- did not have the time to go back down stairs so we prayed hopefully it will be a quite nite. When we return from our outing for the night & a few drinks at the bar, a quiet night was had —- no slamming doors; loud voices or noise & no night traffic we still did not have the morning view but a good nights rest was needed. Our entire stay, we only had to request the car once as everything was pretty much in walking distance without feeling overwhelmed or exhausted. Was a bit surprised of all the extra fees and taxes on our bill but I guess that’s the new norm so people should really be aware of these fees before checking in & out, I felt like we paid for another night stay with all the additional fees —-Overall a good stay —but the fees should be explained up front. we would use this location again if we had too.",8,Tena,2025-05-26
"I arrived at the hotel at 7pm and it took me nearly 40 minutes for checking as a front desk manager named Bree to check if the room was available. 
The breakfast was bad. The waiter wasn’t attentive when taking order. Endup I waited for half of hour without food. When I complained it to the front desk whether I got bad treatment because of using complementary vouchers which her staff gave me when checkin, the front desk manager challenged me that I was not supposed to have the vouchers without excuse on the matter of breakfast service.

"This place is a complete disaster from top to bottom. My boyfriend and I booked through Expedia and paid in advance for breakfast, but the moment we arrived, the staff had no idea what they were doing. The person at the front desk didn’t even give us our breakfast vouchers. Seriously?

Even though we already PAID for breakfast, every single time we tried to eat, we were handed a check and expected to tip—are you kidding me? The food was awful, the service was worse, and absolutely nothing was worth the extra charge. Do not waste your money on breakfast here.

And if you think the pool is any better—think again. We tried to relax at night and were greeted by dead flies and swarms of mosquitoes floating in and around the pool. Disgusting.

This entire experience was an absolute rip-off. Total waste of time and money.",4,Bersu,2025-05-25

There was a leak in our room. Actually a leak on the 23rd floor. The noise on the outside was very bothersome- one of the maintenance men left a machine running all throughout the night to dry up the floor. The room I chose didn’t look like Expedia photos. It was a different room/ look like it was for handicap persons. The stay was okay just for one birthday night! I did like that it was close to the Casino! And walking distance to the French Quarter but other than that. I don’t think will stay there again. Thanks ,6,Sharice,2025-05-15

"There are many great things about this property and an equally amount of bad. Valet did not provide directions upon arrival and then addressed us in a condescending tone once we headed inside the property to ask the front desk. Check in went well and was one of the highlights of the trip. The staff member that helped us get our luggage to the room was one of the nicest and most helpful employees we interacted with. We asked several staff members about the location of an ice machine and we either were told they don’t know or we were sent to floors that had the ice machine removed. The tv and phone in our room were outdated and didn’t work well. Other than the issues mentioned above, the room was comfortable and clean. There were issues at check out concerning our bill and these could not be resolved before we had to leave. Overall the stay was not what we expected for a highly rated property.

"Overall stay was decent but lots of disappointing factors. Got in late and had standoff-ish staff at check in, told we were given 1 free drink a day at the bar but charged for it, and extra fees not disclosed that you are charged for end of visit. Based on plenty of reviews on google it’s not worth your time to get a refund post visit. We did not touch the actual fridge or snacks in the room and the actual “fridge” states it’s a cooler and barely kept things cool. Our floor did not have an ice machine, had to go to 2 other floors to find one that worked. Had issues with the wifi and had to call multiple times. Tried calling for towels and toilet paper- front desk never answered, went to desk just to have them say they’ll have some sent up. Check out was pleasant and the bell hop staff are very personable when they kept our luggage after check out. The location is super convenient but so are the 20 other hotels around this one, would likely stay at another place if visiting again. ",6,Emily,2025-04-23

"First impression - never again! Just walking through the door there was a strong musty smell. As I got to the front desk, I asked what the smell was and the person said it's a number of things - clearly not a good first impression. 

Proceeded to my room, started to try to unpack, the room was pretty basic, no frills. It looked clean until I looked at the floor and realized that it appeared as if it had not been vacuumed in a year. I immediately called the front desk and asked that someone come up with a vacuum or that they move me to another room.  They eventually came up with the vacuum and did what they should've done earlier that day before I checked in. 

The next day, I inadvertently dropped some lotion on the table, so it was just there. I had been out all day, when I came back in, my room did not look like it was serviced because everything just looked the same, but then I notice my bed was fixed, so I knew that they had been there.  I took a look at the table, however, and that lotion drop was still there, which again tells me they do not clean their rooms! 

I must like being punished because then I decided later that evening to order room service. They have like a 24% service charge, gratuity charges, all this stuff and then I bought my food up in brown bags and plastic containers as if I went  to Chili's and got takeout. I was totally confused as to how my food came up - no straw, no napkins, everything in plastic containers, as if I was at a fast food restaurant ",2,Kelly,2025-04-20

"Nothing , after booking a room for my 18 yr through Expedia, the hotel informed me they would not allow him to check in. I asked the hotel representative if I could cancel, because of this reason, he said sure,have Expedia call the hotel and they would get it done. I had to reach out to Expedia numerous times and each time they dragged their feet calling. When they finally reached the hotel, the person they talked to said the reservation will not be canceled, it would be a now show reservation and my card would be charged. In the future, I probably won’t go through Expedia, book direct through the hotel

"The hotel, the staff and the cleanliness was above expectation. The only thing we were unhappy about was the ""destination fees"". We were charged for basically having things available to us. Things we did NOT use. We used nothing in the minibar, did not use the gym facilities or pool, did not use the soaps provided in the bathroom, and we never even used any of the glasses provided for drinking. We didn't even use the room coffee machine, eat at the restaurant or drink at the bar! We just slept there and never even turned on the tv, but were charged  for having those things provided in case we wanted them? We never used room service, didn't use their valet services, and never even called the front desk.
Then we find out that Marriott will not reverse those charges, but other hotels, such as the Hilton, will. 
We probably will not stay at another Marriott again.",8,Mark,2025-03-03
Centralt hotell med behagligt gångavstånd till Canalstreet och French quarters. Fräscht rum. Vi åt frukost på hotellet en morgon och tyckte att portionerna av äggröra och bacon var små samt att kaffet serverades i pappmuggar. Trevlig och hjälpsam personal i receptionen.,8,Eva,2025-03-02
"Loved the property! Staff was very friendly and hospitable. When we arrived, our room wasn’t quite ready and we had to wait quite some time for check-in due to a large group coming in, but they applied a $100 credit to use at the bar and restaurant, which went a long way. Bar had a great staff and excellent drinks. Room was VERY nice and clean. Fitness Center was great and had the top-of-the line machines and a good variety of machines. Hotel is in a perfect location—walkable to Canal, Bourbon Street, and the Riverwalk and other restaurants and bars, yet away from the chaos those areas can bring. It was a pleasant surprise to see Mardi Gras parades happening right outside the hotel as well! Overall, I’ll definitely be staying again on my next trip to New Orleans!",10,Kwalee,2025-03-02

We were able to easily walk everywhere. There were many restaurants around the area and we felt safe. The property is pet friendly, we brought our small dog, only issue is there was no area for bathroom breaks - or else I didn’t find it? It was actually very hard to find any grass anywhere. Hotel was nice, room was quiet, bed was good, we had the corner room with city view and it was nice. We didn’t interact with the staff much. We were told that we each got $25/day to spend on food and drink, our last day we did the buffet breakfast and were charged for it minus -$25. So we didn’t each get our credit.

"The location was convenient and has a lot of potential to be luxury however there are maintenance problems. The hotel management was very polite and accommodating.

"I would never stay at this hotel again. Upon check-in, they authorized over $450 on my card, even though I specifically asked how much they would charge, and they told me only $100. The beds were so uncomfortable that I had to check out early due to severe back pain, which I'm still dealing with. On top of that, the air conditioning wasn’t working properly. The rooms are small, dark, and cramped, with a tiny air conditioner and a mini-fridge that's even smaller than usual. The staff was nice and professional. I appreciated that. Overall, a very disappointing experience.",2,Nichollette,2024-09-08

I was a bit disappointed in the cleanliness and lack of preparation that went into my room esp since I called from the hey … the bathroom wasn’t wiped down … we lacked small toiletries like lotion… soap… etc… I love this hotel and is always my first choice… I believe in yall to keep the standard that has kept me coming back. Thank you for honoring the valet set by Expedia without sending me on a wild goose chase for redeeming it ,6,Joy,2024-09-02

"LMNO is local to all the hot tourist spots(Frenchman, Bourbon st, canal st). We were able to walk mostly everywhere. The lobby is kept clean and cool. Front desk is professional and friendly. Cookies given each night which were delicious. Bedding in the room was comfy and housekeeping was fine. Unfortunately the walls are paper thin. No exaggeration. We stayed on the 18th floor and could hear cars from street level as well as our neighboring room conversations. The pool on the 4th floor is very small, doesn’t get much sunlight and had an infestation of bugs/flies which harmed the experience. It’s impossible to tan or drink cocktails peacefully under those conditions. Overall my stay was pleasant. ",8,Janay,2024-09-02

I was attending a Convention so I didn't spend a lot of time at the hotel. The reception desk was really great. I had a bit of trouble with breakfast at the bar and they accommodated me. It took awhile to figure out the $25 meal voucher and the dessert but both were worth it when I did. I didn't get a chance to use some of the other extras like the tours. The elevators were fast which was good when I was in a hurry. The only drawback is the amount of pot being used around the city; the smell really detracted from the experience of New Orleans. The bed was really comfortable and the room clean. I was glad for the free water bottle as it was hot and I walked to the Convention at a different hotel.,10,Verified traveler,2024-08-22

"I booked this hotel because it had many good reviews but it was definitely a waste of money. I specifically booked this hotel for the available parking, in room refrigerator, and paid extra for a riverview room and none of those listed amenities were provided. The lady that checked is in also seemed to be extremely out of it as she was pacing back and forth and slurring while checking us in. The parking was vallet only for $55 a night which was not specified and when we went to park the car they told us the vallet parking was full so we had to park at another hotel and walk back. So much money wasted paying for parking nowhere so keep our food, and scammed out of the riverview. Also charged us to use the wi-fi per day. Very money hungry hotel with providing nothing in return.

"This is definitely not a business hotel despite being on the edge of the CBD. When I arrived there were unsupervised children running around the bar area and patchy WiFi made it very difficult to work. And at least two guests wearing electronic ankle tags doesn’t make for an entirely relaxing stay.

“Breakfast” is a rip off. $30 for a buffet consisting of a handful of items and one morning they even forgot to put the bread out for toast (how?! It wasn’t that there were so many other things they wouldn’t have noticed). 

On the plus side the bar and the evening bar staff were very pleasant even if a bit pricey compared to other hotel bars in NOLA. The reception staff on the other hand were variable. I had to explain the concept of a late checkout when I tried to arrange one. But both check in and check out were excellent.

"Reviews are meant to be helpful for potential future clientele to make informed decisions.
The only thing great about this place is its location.
I truly should have listened to my gut the moment we arrived to the awkwardly looking entrance, and left.
Upon arrival there was a bit of a wait to check in which I’m patient and don’t mind, however getting to the desk we weren’t even greeted with a hello, just a mere “ your ID” . Handed my ID no acknowledgment of Marriot status, I don’t mind , but that’s the norm of every Marriot we have stayed. Next “your card” no client service skills what so ever .
- the room looked like that of a highway motel, it was the task of a root canal to have the room changed
- room changed finally, not much better but we were tired and decided to just make do.
- alas one towel two wash cloths and hand towels. I requested to have towels, soap and toothpaste. An hour later toothpaste a mere single packet of toothpaste arrived, no towels. Ok we decided to share the one towel since for sure housekeeping would replenish upon cleaning. We left for 10 hours , came back the bed made and we were left with the same single dirty towel no fresh ones. Smh
- I’ll jump to the end, because there were too many more kinks during stay , lukewarm warm shower, hard bed etc
- morning of check out housekeeper knocked door at 8:41 am, waking us up after a long night. I then called the front desk to ask for a noon check out after this occurrence and was told I was “pushing it”",4,Kadianne,2024-05-25

Booked a river view.  Paid extra.  When I arrived they put me into a city view with a tremendously loud air con system.  Called down.  “We have no river views available”.  No apology.  Eventually spoke to duty manager Maia.  Suddenly one opens up.  She said I had a preference in my profile for city view.  Never made such a request.  House cleaning does not vacuum.  Check-in staff are dishonest.  Be extra vigilant.  They sent me three different bills.  One with premium internet tacked on.  Another with additional charges I never agreed to.  And finally they have charged me more than what was agreed at reservation.  Still ducking it out with Marriott/Le Méridien.,4,Verified traveler,2024-05-22
"The pros - staff, food, location
The cons - thin walls. I could hear entire conversations next door, if someone ran water, etc.

Staff was attentive and quick though. It’s a walkable distance to Bourbon & Canal. Expect some noise through the night/morning just due to the location. If you’re staying over here, that should be a given. Nothing like staying on Bourbon though. It wasn’t unbearable, but I’m a pretty heavy sleeper.

The A/C was good. The curtains made the room black, which was great for sleeping.

They allowed for a late check out at 12 without extra charge.",8,Anthony,2024-05-21

"The checkin and checkout was very easy. The room was immaculate as well as the main reception and halls.
All the staff were friendly and approachable.
The one disappointment, and to me it was huge. There was a cable outside our window that repeatedly hit our window all night. I reported this to the front desk. The next night it was significantly worse. The front desk did offer to change rooms however it was already late.

"Upon checking in, I was told that my room wasn't ready. Check in was at 4pm, we walked in at 4:05. Strike one. We said ok, we'll wait for the room to be ready. When coming back, the manager tried to tell me I hadn't booked the room I that I paid for. I showed her my receipt showing that I did, in fact, book this particular room. Strike two.
We get into the room and I immediately go to check the sheets. The sheets were stained and there was a LIVE INSECT CRAWLING IN THE BED. I took video of it and we go back down to the front desk to inform them of this disgusting turn of events. As we tell them, the manager gives me the option of either taking the same type of room or upgrading to a suite. 
After all of that, the upgrade should have been immediate. We take the upgrade as well as vouchers for breakfast the next morning. The suite sheets also had hair in them and we never received the allergen free bedding we requested until the night before we were due to check out.
The curtains had dust bunnies on them. Literally.

Strikes 3 through infinity.

It's really a shame because I've stayed at that property before and it was really great. It's so sad to see a once incredible hotel get so bad.

Nice hotel. For New Orleans.   Felt safe.  Parking is valet.  Or across street at the casino.  You can walk to the water and mall a few blocks.  French quarter is walkable. But Uber was $8 French quarter and French market. Are fun.  Lots of music. Restaurants. Local art vendors. Parking sucks everywhere. But hotel you pay.  And don’t worry.  Only issue was marijuana smell coming into room vents from smokers in the hotel.  It was mostly the weekend when the party goers checked in.  ,8,salim,2024-04-11

Spoke to about 5 different people about my pending case. Their protocol for this situation to protect other guests is disgusting and ridiculous. I was told they would get a 3rd party exterminator to give me results “mid-day” for peace of mind since I’m traveling… it’s past that time! Still no phone call from the general manager or operating manager. When checking out they tried to make me pay an additional $400 dollars after already paying upon arrival and gaslit me into thinking I was crazy. Turns out they were in the wrong!

When we first pulled up my impression was that it was hard to pull into the property due to all of the cars the valet had parked there. We got in extremely late (like 1am) and as we walked in the door I felt like the inside was extremely nice but had a Las Vegas casino type smell. Like a musk they were heavily misting to cover the smell of something else. Once we made it to the room it was humid and hot and smell awful!! There was a giant stain on the comforter of one of the beds and the shower looked like it hadn’t actually been scrubbed in a while. The night staff took forever to check us in and weren’t friendly at all. The morning staff were quick and over the top nice. I won’t be staying here again.,4,Samantha,2024-03-11

I am an avid traveler and have stayed at many locations but this particular location is so so in my opinion. Check in process was okay but there were many agents at the front desk with a not so nice attitude expect for one person. Upon arrival in our room we were greeted with an awful smell of mold or wet carpet. Another issue was our tv was not working properly. It would glitch on and off and could not watch something without being interrupted by a huge static noise every 5 seconds or so. On our floor there was old room service left out from the day we checked in to the following day we checked out. The Méridien properties are usually top tier but this location did disappoint a bit. I’m a local and did a staycation for a night and I don’t think I would stay here again. ,4,Elena,2024-03-04

"I had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday at Le Méridien in New Orleans, and it was an absolutely fantastic experience. Our room was on the 14th floor, offering breathtaking views. The hospitality at this hotel was truly impeccable—every staff member greeted us with a warm smile and exhibited positive attitudes throughout our stay.

I felt safe and secure, thanks to the excellent service and attention to detail. The drinks at the bar were nothing short of awesome, adding an extra layer of enjoyment to our time there. Being a first-time visitor to New Orleans, I fell in love with the city, and Le Méridien played a significant role in making my stay memorable.

Our corner room exceeded expectations in every aspect. The layout was well thought out, and the room itself was not only spacious but also impeccably clean. The birdseye view of the Zulu parade from our room was a delightful surprise and added a unique touch to the celebration.

The hotel's location is ideal, with walking distance to both Canal Street and Bourbon Street, making it convenient to explore the vibrant surroundings. Overall, Le Méridien in New Orleans went above and beyond my expectations, and I am definitely looking forward to staying here again in the future. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a memorable and comfortable stay in the heart of the city!

"While the main part of the room was great, the bathroom was terrible. Very small and barely any room to stand. You had to squish yourself in to even close the door, and not to mention the sink is behind the door so the door has to be closed for you to use the sink. The shower had quite the amount of mold in it and the room was a little musty. Bed not so comfortable, but doable to sleep one night in. The roo service was delightful to have but also crazy to have a $5.00 charge for delivery (my bad for failing to read the fine print). The TV was a good size with an awesome picture. The neighboring rooms were loud and people were loud in the hallways. The hallway on the 14th floor where we stayed smelled like cigarette smoke. The staff were friendly, so that was a plus. I know I named more bad then good, but I gave this a 5/10 because it was like 50/50 of the good and bad things. ",6,Aj,2024-03-01

Location is perfect! However we had issues with the heat for some reason. The room was cold at night. There were also issues with the elevators most days either one or 2 of them out of 4 were out of order. It took longer to get to your room or to leave the hotel because the elevators were down.

The room was also exceptionally small for the price. When we spoke to someone about getting our room upgraded to a suite we were told that they all had just been sold out. We continued to smell an awful smell that resembled the sewer throughout our stay. There was a huge brown stain on one of the pillow cases that we did not notice until the second day. 

This was our first time visiting New Orleans and this hotel was one that was recommended by someone else but needless to say, we were underwhelmed.

I was also suppose to have a city view and my view was a wall. ",4,Marsha,2024-02-18

"Nothing was unique about the hotel but being close to everything, staff and security was very rude, trying to ask questions they act like they don’t want to be bothered, went to bar waited on server and he said he ain’t ready to serve us give us a minute, valets was $55 a night and you couldn’t even get acces to vehicle because of Mardi Gras traffic and they still charged you valet fees, room was stinch smelled very damped, no microwave in room just only first floor, had to come from the 23rd floor just to heat food.

Every road to get to this hotel was blocked off because mardi gras was going on. The hotel did not even let you know of this!!!! spent 4 hours in bumper to bumper traffic trying to get to them and it wasn't possible and to top that off they wouldn't waive the fees for nights reserved knowing you couldn't get to them. Horrible!,2,Sandy,2024-02-13
"We stayed for a conference that was being held just a block away. The front desk staff was polite and courteous as this was our first time to NOLA. They suggested a couple places to get some local food. The lobby was clean and festive for Mardi Gras. We didn’t know what to expect for our room but we ended up on the top floor facing the city! It was a great panoramic view, clean and spacious room. Since we were there during Mardi Gras, we learned that a few parades ended their route on Tchoupitoulas St. just outside the hotel! As exciting as this was, it meant going to bed late because the parades ended close to midnight. And even on the top floor, we definitely heard all the music. But we knew what we were getting into so there will not be any demerits here. We walked everywhere we needed to get to: Jackson Square/Cafe Du Monde and other French Quarter eateries and sights. We even were only about 20 minutes walking distance to our ghost tour pick-up/drop-off location. On our checkout day, they even called a cab for us to get back to the airport. Definitely recommend this hotel. ",10,Duane,2024-02-13

The only minor issues i had was the location of the restaurant, in the hotel.  It is  more of a bar/seating area than a restaurant. Due to its location on the ground floor. The cold air from outside travelled into the restaurant, making it very cold.

 No concierge at the hotel, as advertised, but the front desk staff helped with are queries.  The staff were generally nice and welcoming, which was good.Loved the aesthetic of the hotel and room. ",10,Mahalia,2024-01-26

The hotel does not have a lounge for its members which I felt cheated for how much points it costs to stay.  The layout of the room was a little awkward with the doors.

"A/C was out when we checked in but it was being worked on. We went to get something to eat and returned around 7p and the A/C was still out and would not be fixed until Mon (this was Sat night). No problem, things malfunction, not the hotel’s fault but we couldn’t stay because the room was HOT. So we booked a room elsewhere and the manager agreed she would refund the cost of the room. The next morning, when expedia called to confirm the refund, the manager that day said he didn’t see any note in the system about it and that a broken A/C was not a valid reason to refund a room that was occupied. It was only occupied for 2 hours and that was because we were told the A/C would be fixed. Anyway, we only got half of our booking refunded and had to change hotels at 8p.  ",2,DAMIAN,2024-01-15
"Do not stay here. I recently visited new orleans and stayed at le meridien for four nights which were all disappointing. Our first night we realized that after showering there was a puddle of water in the bathroom. This was because the door to the shower was broken beyond a quick fix as the maintenance guy told us. Everytime we showered during our stay there was a puddle of water in our bathroom and nothing could be done about it.The next day we were out and about for most of the day and when we returned our room smelled extremely disgusting. To each their own and what other people do in their rooms is not my concern but when the smell of marijuana easily flows through the air vents and enters others rooms it is unpleasant. To add to do this, the walls are extremely thin, i could hear every conversation my neighbors had, word for word. Now the very disappointing part of my experience was at the end of our stay. I booked this hotel to include valet parking which was the worst part of it all. It neared the check out time so my boyfriend called for his car to which he received no immediate response compare to the previous times we had called for our car. After a long wait, he heads downstairs and personally speaks to the valet employees. Their response was that there were not enough staff to go get his car from the parking garage, but they were just buying time to come up with a solution to his missing car keys. After more of a wait, one of the employees told my boyfriend they d",2,Cristofer,2024-01-15

Unfortunately it was one of those trips that we had several things go wrong! We got there and they took our luggage from the car and it never made it to the room! Had to track it down and bring it up myself. The TV did not work and the hair dryer had no buttons on it. They did get the tv working but never replaced the hair dryer. The 2nd room I reserved had no air and no tv. They could not get the air fixed and never brought a fan as promised.

Additionally, despite the booking indicating breakfast was included, the front desk only provided a $30 voucher, which covered the cost for just one person due to the higher menu prices.

Staff was shouting at me and criticizing with their colleagues and other customers. Internet was 15 USD per each connection, so ended up paying 45 one day. Nobody told us was payable or that rate was chargeable every time we were connecting to internet.
Toilet had huge black stains, I was told is rust, not dirt.
Staff very unfriendly, nobody cared if we were happy or not. Left one day before as we felt very unsafe and uncomfortable. Is unbelievable this can happen in a Le Meridien Hotel.

It was totally empty upon my arrival and not working.  When reported, the person i spoke with said it would be fixed. In my two day stay, it was never fixed.

"It’s look like the site has had a face lift but when your looking out room window at the nice view, if you got a room on a high enough floor, you would see that the window edges are crumbling across the top. You also hear people talking and their adult sessions. I had one valet person just give me my key and say it’s on the street, which was not in sight, I had to ask him to go get my car. Mins you I’ve been tip valet service even if it’s costing 30-50 a day. I like there sitting areas and there pool area and the work out session was nice, great equipment and selection too.

"It was terrible, the toilet was dirty with someone else’s poop. The carpet smelled weird, and I took my socks off for one minute to change before we left and I got home from this trip with athletes foot. They don’t clean anything.  The valet people killed my car battery and had to jump the car. The whole experience in this hotel was absolutely HORRIBLE! AVOID AT ALL COST! Spend the extra money and stay somewhere nicer.

"The property is pretty nice, but there was a mouse at the bar the second night we were there. We had asked for a 1 hour extension for our check out and the receptionist didn’t even wait until I finished my request before shutting me down. I think for the price of this hotel the staff should be a but friendlier and our rooms should be cleaned daily and not only done upon request. There was no trash bin in the bathroom which was a bit bothersome being that you can accumulate alot of garbage in the bathroom. ",6,Laurenis,2023-10-13

"We stayed at Le Meridien for 4 nights and had a great time. We really enjoyed the pool during the day when it was scorching outside. Check-in was SUPER easy, took less than 5 minutes. Check out was also a breeze. The location is a short walking distance to Bourbon St (10 mins) but still far enough away from the noise of the rowdy crowds. The bed was comfy and we had a great view of the pool. It’s also a short walk to the mall which was a nice reprieve from the heat. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and we will definitely book again if we ever find our way back to NOLA.",10,Jacqueline,2023-08-27

Housekeeping lost n found was impossible to get a hold of. Never returned any messages. Never picked up the phone. Took no responsibility for anything. Acted like nothing happened. Either they didn’t check the closet, which is impossible because they had to put the ironing board back inside, or they stole our items. The latter is what happened. Other than expensive items ($300+) stolen by housekeeping department, the hotel was great. Stay here. It’s great. ",2,Verified traveler,2023-08-16

We did have to have them fix our bill after we left and got our invoice as we had booked with valet parking included but there was something wrong as they couldn’t see that on their end. They fixed it but it was an extra hassle.  We’d stay again.  ",10,Verified traveler,2023-08-10

Otherwise the staff the bartenders and the hotel is amazing. 
Everyone is very friendly and carry a good conversation.
