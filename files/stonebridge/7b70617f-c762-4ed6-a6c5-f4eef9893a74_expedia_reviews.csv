Clean room although a bit runs down. They were doing renovations but it would’ve been better to have just closed it down. The breakfast could be better or change the menu everyday. It was the same and not too great. ,6,Angelica,2025-09-23
"Hotel had some renovations going on and made the hotel look a little dated and dirty. Close to the freeway and highways and you could really hear everything going on outside . Woke me up several times throughout the nights I was there. No ice machine. Have to go to the downstairs bar to get ice for your room. Low water pressure for the shower. Speaking of the shower, we have a few roach’s visit our bathroom during my 3-day stay. The AC in the room is loud and I had to turn it off. Not good considering you have to turn the AC off in Phoenix, AZ. I do not recommend this hotel. Not as nice as other Hyatt Place hotels I have stayed at throughout the country.

"Would be nice to get my deposit back font know why it takes so long to return it I was there when i checked in and the lady told me it could take up to a month.  If it takes that long, I don’t wanna stay there no more than because what are they doing with your money? It’s not right you should put a deposit down and get it back the next day or the same day not keep it for 30 days. They still haven’t gotten to me. It’s been over a week. I’m a little bit irritated. They’re hurting for money that bad then I’ll go somewhere else to stay bad business.",6,shawnn,2025-05-30

"This was our second time at this property. This last visit there was nothing stating that it was under renovation until we arrived. There was dust in the hallways and the elevator. The first morning, we do not have any hot water. The response from the front desk was nonchalant. Unfortunately we were not able to take a shower. This was a disappointing visit. ",4,Connie,2025-05-09
"Construction on the property! We were disappointed in the lack of transparency on this property. This was our second time staying at this property. Enjoyed it very much because of the location and it was a close proximity to where we needed to be. After a long drive, we did not have hot water. We were not notified of the hot water being turned off. The response from the front desk was very nonchalant. Unfortunately we were not able to shower that morning.",2,Connie,2025-05-09
"I booked 2 rooms, and family booked 4 other rooms for 2 nights. We were there for my daughters graduation. We were never told the wayer would be shut off from 10am to 2pm. No men got to shower and all the women had to shower at a gym off ptoperty. The front desk had no sympathy or solutions for us. Another properly perhaps. Maybe a simple sign that would grab your attention. Sad, because that is the only properly we stay at when we visit our daughter. ",2,Donald,2025-05-08

Renovation caused a bit of discomfort but they were apologetic. ,10,Nalani,2025-05-06
"The first night we got a room on the 4th floor facing the highway. It was so noisy we could barely stay asleep. We actually thought the windows were open. 
But the staff was really kind and efficient and moved us to a quiet room on the other side of the building. View was not nice but at least we could sleep. ",8,Juan Antonio,2025-05-06
"















My recent stay at the Hyatt began with an unfortunate inconvenience. I was initially given the wrong room key, and when I notified the front desk, the attendant insisted I was in the correct room. I had reserved a one-bedroom with two beds, but the room had only one. After some back-and-forth, he finally rechecked and confirmed that I had indeed been checked into the wrong room.

Additionally, I was not informed in advance that the water would be shut off for several hours the next day. This was particularly disruptive, as I was in town for a very important event—my college graduation.

To make matters worse, my travel companion, who has experience in fire safety, noticed that the smoke detector in our room was detached from the wall and not functioning, as indicated by the missing signal light. This raised serious safety concerns.

Overall, while the location was convenient, the experience was disappointing due to the initial confusion, lack of communication about utility maintenance, and safety oversight in the room.

"Friendly, homely ",10,Xhutmali,2025-05-05
It was a great experience staying here!! They were so pleasant and accommodating! The manager went out of his way to make sure I got to the bank to deposit my money for my room. He even took me to dollar tree to get things for my stay!! My family and I were very fortunate to find such a nice place. They serve breakfast and have a refreshing pool. Well worth it!! ,10,Vanessa,2025-05-04

"This property is dirty, filthy and has roaches big enough to carry your furniture. Once we saw the roaches ( in the room) we wanted our money back. We left and went to the Hilton. Don’t stay at this property unless you work for a pest control company.🙁
",2,Archie,2025-04-28
"That property was filthy. Needs to be upgraded. The sink in the bathroom did not drain, it took forever for the shower to get hot water, that carpets were stained and dirty. The cabinet in the hall way was so dusty that we wrote “ please wash me” in the top of it.",2,Pam A,2025-04-27
"We had no hot water, our towels were not washed and were covered in hair. We were moved to a different room and water in that room was barely warm. No compensation and no contaxt with management has happened at thjs time. ",2,Brittany,2025-04-27
"The staff was absolutely amazing. I interacted with at least 5 staff memmbers and they were all very friendly and professional. 

The room itself was another story. The carpet was stained and ripped, the sink was very slow to drain. The main light switch was busted. The light above the wet bar did not work. Some of the outlets did not work either. The couch looked raggy and old. Thr pullout couch matress might as well not have been there. Probably one of the worst rooms I have ever stayed in. And it is sad, because like I said at the beginning, the staff were so nice and friendly. ",6,David,2025-04-27
No water each day from 10-2.  Room had a smell right when you entered the room.  No hot water for 3 people.   Breakfast in the morning was under cooked and poor quality!  Not a fan!,2,Mark,2025-04-26

"We did not know that the Hyatt Place was under renovations and were in town for a wedding.  This place is in really bad shape.  Stains on all carpets, maid service only 1 out of 4 days, and likely should not be open until renovations are complete.  Staff was nice enough though and it’s of no fault of theirs.

"Many issues whith this place. The bathtub mixer was broken and shower water was boiling. The room was facing the highway and windows have no soundproof system in any form, so it’s like you’re sleeping right at the side of it. The carpet has huge stains all over, among some other inconveniences . A good place if you’re on a budget, but you should avoid it if you want a good sleep and stay in general. ",6,Armando,2025-04-21

Other notes- incredible filthy rooms with stains on the floor and furniture, broken wood shelves, tears, dirty walls, breakfast but they were out of plates, no light on in the breakfast area.

Would not stay here again.  The room smelled like pee.  The carpet was dirty. No soap in the room to ash your hands. The shower barely drained.  Only had two towels in a room with two double beds.  The beds were awful too. I expected so much more with the Hyatt name.  It was like staying in a Days Inn. ,4,Kelly,2025-01-14

The carpet in the room was dirty, the whole room layout was odd, including a sink in front of the bed. The bathroom tiles were dirty and areas of the room were stained with weird substances. The bed was probably full of bedbugs cause we started itching not even 10 minutes after laying in it. We left immediately and decided to stay at the Marriot. I would not stay in a Hyatt hotel ever again. I took pictures of the room, but I cannot post them on Expedia. I would not recommend staying at this place.

We checked into our room only to find the carpet stained in several different places, the window was dirty, and the tub looked filthy. When we asked to change room the African American man who is also the bartender had an attitude and stated he only had a handicap room available and we need to make that room work for us because there is no other. That room was a little better the tub was not dirty but it have several cigarette burns on the carpet, the carpet was old and just seemed dirty and In need of a carpet cleaner, the walls were dirty as well as the bead board. My husband is 6’1” so he was not too thrilled about being in a handicap room but it was a little cleaner than the first room. This hotel really needs to be renovated.

"This hotel should be condemned. The carpets are so filthy we made sure to never have our shoes off. No housekeeping- just pick up towels downstairs.
Includes Breakfast- it’s a joke. Out of everything early and no one is replenishing any items. They are squeezing every cent out of this place and you can feel it. We will NEVER stay here again and don’t recommend anyone (unless you are homeless) to stay here either. ",2,melaney,2025-01-02
"If it wasn't for the enthusiastic and helpful check in staff, I would say not to bother with this one. The rooms are tired! Broken outlets, poor repairs in the shower, stained carpets, empty shampoo dispensers, etc. On top of that, Hyatt Places overall, have the smallest queen beds ever. Don't count on having more than one person in the bed comfortably.  The breakfast was pretty plain and lackluster. I remember when Hyatt Places were pretty incredible but it appears as though that season has passed. With so many other options in Phoenix, definitely worth your time to look around and find something less tired. ",6,Sara,2025-01-02

"Room 1:
Backed up plumbing; toilet would not flush during our Christmas stay. 
When my wife called the front desk for a service request, she was told there was nothing that would be done. When she persisted, she was told she could come downstairs and they might loan her a plunger to take care of it herself! She hung up. 
I called directly and got us assigned another room outright. 
Room 2:
As our daughter would tell us the following morning, before taking a shower, she noticed the bathroom had a black discoloration at the edges and that the shower had small holes in the bottom. 
When she stepped into the shower, rancid water came up through the holes!
Is this really a Hyatt or some dive motel in the projects of South Phoenix?

We had a 2 night stay (Saturday & Sunday) The pictures are not accurate at all. When I showed the front desk person he said the third party just puts whatever pictures they want. But I went to the Hyatt website where the same misconceiving pictures were. The front desk person just said there was nothing he can do about the false advertisement. The bathroom looks nothing like the advertised pictures. The room we received was with two beds instead of a king and they were the worst beds I have ever slept in in my life. We were told since we booked with hotels.com we didn’t have a choice in bed type (although I selected king & our reservation was for a king) Our sink was broke and dirty and we were told to deal with it. We had to use the sink in the bar area to brush our teeth.  The bathroom light was broken and wouldn’t stay on. The a/c was loud . The carpet was covered in stains. We were given keys to another room that was out of service with fans in it and taken apart. Sunday after we went came back we were told someone else was given our room. After a few minutes a front desk person walked us up and told us we were moving rooms. So we had to move rooms the 2nd night with no one asking or speaking to us first. No one in management called me as I requested for night one. Just completely disgusted with the service and condition of the hotel. ,2,Jennifer,2024-12-12

"This was a very disappointing stay. First, I didn't get a handicap accessible room as requested. Next, do not believe anything on their website. This place does not have a bar/restaurant, no baked goods, or deli. At least the breakfast was fairly good. Lastly, the pool area was extremely disappointing. It's very small and located in a dingy area. Also all you can hear is the I17 traffic. I thought the Hyatt name came with higher standards but apparently I was wrong. The only good thing about this place is the staff.",4,Kristine,2024-10-20
"We stayed 4 nights, and after making our reservation and then seeing so many 1-star reviews, I was not looking forward to it – but thankfully our experience was not as bad as those. It was a decent hotel, and while many of their concerns were observed during our stay, it was a very mediocre hotel. Basically, the property just looks run down and in need of a refresh, and it was obviously under-staffed. The breakfast food options were good, but every morning they ran out of coffee and other food items often within 20 minutes of breakfast beginning, and never seemed to catch up. Our room also wasn't cleaned until the last day of our stay.

The entrance is easy to drive past, and if you miss it you'll have to circle around a 5-6 min loop to get back to the front of the building. Quite irritating for our first night.

On the positive side – there are a number of dining options and a park with paved walking trails and a playground nearby as well. And anytime I asked the staff about missing something in our room (since our coffee/towels was never replenished, and we were missing any bedding for the pull-out sofa), they were quick to rectify it.

Overall it was a mediocre to subpar stay. If they offered a great deal I may stay here again – but plan to look for a different option next time we're in town.",6,Isaac,2024-10-20

I told the clerk about it and he said he would have the food preparer bring some out. I ate my whole breakfast and no hot water ever came out.

"The hotel was not as it seemed in the pictures. The room had stained spots on the carpet, ottoman, and couch. The name Hyatt Place carries a lot of weight in the hotel industry. I expected a more up to date property. The hotel looked like it use to be an old extended stay. We had our two month old baby with us and found a cockroach in the bathroom. We showed it to the front desk and spoke with Tammy, she was helpful to offer a different room but I wanted to be moved to a different hotel because when there is one roach, there is two but moving hotels was not an option. The next evening it was a termite crawling in the bed, 18 inches above our son head. The only good part of the property is that they are located in the area of our favorite restaurants. Almost all rental car companies at the airport only offered electrical vehicles. This hotel did not have a plug in port or any ports nearby to charge the car. So another suggestion besides exterminating the bugs is to have a plug port for EV cars since AZ is changing to only EV rentals. ",2,Lakendra,2024-08-25

Boy, was I wrong!

The minute we walked into our room we were met with stained (severely) carpets, old retainers left in the closet, stained bathroom walls, cold breakfast food, disgusting microwave and just all around dirty hotel.

Then, add that the entire weekend we needed to escorted by staff to get into the pool and into the building because the keycards didn’t work!

The only thing going for this hotel was the staff who were kind, accommodating, and worked so hard running constantly!

We were also disappointed to see no hand soap in the room, and after a call to the front desk, their shipment of hand soap didn’t arrive on time either. We had to make our own accommodation for that. We did get our needed rest on the beds and pullout bed. The staff were friendly and did their best to help us out with towels and bedding, but it was after a second call to the desk that we received the towels with the needed bed linens for the pullout sofa bed.

I needed an accessible room and even though the staff was able to change the room, her attitude was as if it was an inconvenience to her. No customer service at all. 
The following morning I had an early graduation ceremony to attend and planned to eat breakfast early but only to find out that there wasn’t going to be breakfast because “they didn’t show up”.  That was one of the reasons why I chose to book for the breakfast that was supposedly included. No comp was offered.

"The hotel rooms are in need of major refreshment.  The Carpet and furniture were stained. The bed was worn out.  Basically, I don't think the hotel has been updated since built.  On the plus side, the bathroom was clean, no problem there.  And the Breakfast was pretty good, the cut fruit being the best part.
  I felt the room price was way over valued, but that might have been because the WM Golf tournament was in town.",6,Thomas,2024-02-17

"Do not waste your time or money at this hotel.  We stayed 5 nights and did not get housekeeping to come even once despite continuing to ask and request the service.  We had to ask the front desk for clean towels and linens several times.  The carpets in the room were disgusting and stained all over and when I told them about it they said most of the rooms are like that and the hotel needs a remodel.  We came back to the hotel one of the nights after being out all day to find no housekeeping was done and the front desk lady said she wasn't surprised housekeeping did not clean our room and it wasn't her problem.  The service is by far the worst I have ever received at a hotel and the room and cleanliness was even worse.  I have stayed at Hyatt Place hotels in many other places with no issues at all, not here!  DO NOT book this hotel, you will be wasting your time and money! ",2,Verified traveler,2024-02-13

"The staff was kind and fantastic. 
 Our room was filthy. Huge stains in the carpet and couch. Most of our outlets didn't work. It was noisy being right by the highway.  
Hyatt needs to put a little money into this hotel. When I stay at a Hyatt I have expectations, this did not meet those expectations. I would not recommend. ",4,Amy,2024-02-11
"Another consistently enjoyable stay at this hotel.  I'm a repeat customer and appreciate the friendly staff and comfortable rooms and the delicious hot breakfasts buffet style.  The food was just as good as I remembered last year, although I did miss those fresh made biscuits and muffins- hopefully those can come back!  

I'm not bothered by the highway and I love the location of this hotel for that reason as it is so convenient, but if being near a major highway bothers you, then be aware you can hear traffic.  After living in many cities, I find it restful and it's white noise to me but others may not find it the same.  

Overall, a great stay and I wish I could have enjoyed the area for longer.",10,Verified traveler,2024-02-11

Also, small gripe…but food allergy sufferers beware, no ingredients whatsoever are listed on any of the breakfast foods offered, not even the cereal. I have a soy allergy and that stuff sneaks in the oddest places so if I can’t see ingredients, I don’t eat. Some foods I know are safe but it’s on an individual brand level and if you don’t tell me whether that’s name brand or off brand Raisin Bran, I can’t trust it. (I did not partake of free breakfast.)

The room… the shower didn’t drain well and was not cleanly at all. The sofa had so much collected dust and stains. The floor stains were awful as well. I’m think im just more so upset at the fact it was a staycation for a ONE NIGHT get away with hubby and I wanted to leave so bad because of how unkept and gross this place was.

"I have traveled extensively and I like to stay a nice places with good reviews. When I initially saw the reviews I was convinced it was worth the price (300 dls for one night). We arrived at 3:10. 10 minutes past the check in. They told us the room wasn't ready and made us wait 30 minutes. The front desk people were not friendly at all. They also didn't look professional. They were very casual except for the name tag they wore. It was hard to tell who worked there or not. Anyway, we got our room it was very outdated and the couches were dirty with stains. The kid wanted to rest so we opened the sofa bed and there were no sheets at all, the old mattress was naked. I tried calling the front desk and the phone didn't work. It was plugged but completely dead. Hubby went and got some blankets from them. We finally decided to get ready for a wedding and when I tried plugging my curly iron the plugs didn't work. Only one worked near the TV. I decided not to make a fuss and just go enjoy the wedding. When we got back we were so tired but finally able to rest and to our surprised the pillows were very uncomfortable. It seemed like they threw them to the washer and all the cotton was in chunks. The mattress was a spring mattress! You could feel them and hear them. I was honestly expecting way more from a Hyatt place. The 300 dls we paid were not worth it at all.

Our friends room the shower knob was falling off the shower they could not even use it. The breakfast was very small and they had dirty plates lined up behind the food. They did not have clean plates or cups, the guy could not find filters to make coffee, the bananas were mooshy and the only thing edible was the cereal.

And oh by the way, only beer for the advertised football special  was the Bud Lite. As my stay was Sunday night, i did watch the game.
I have traveled all over the country, stayed at Hyatt properties, and others and this is without a doubt the worst Hyatt i have ever experienced as a customer

The property was dirty. The room door was open upon arrival. The couch in the room had cigarette burns. The carpet had stains. The the sink was located next to the bed and not in the bathroom. The bathroom towels were on the floor. ,2,Matthew,2023-10-14
"Cannot believe this hotel has the Hyatt name. It’s completely run down, dirty carpet in the room, lingering cigarette smell, poorly lit rooms. When we checked in the person at the front desk was in her cell phone, and continued to be in it during her shift. We regretted booking this hotel, if we knew it was this bad would have splurged on a better stay elsewhere.",2,John,2023-10-14

"The location was ideal, but the condition of that particular facility was less than par. Our room #413, had stained carpets, so much so, that my wife kept socks on while walking around the room. ( the bottom of her socks were were filthy). Which brought to my attention that I did not see or hear a singe carpet vacuum during our weekend stay. Which showed in all the common spaces, such as hallways, elevators and lobby. Because of these details, I did not feel comfortable with taking advantage of the complimentary breakfast, I felt that the lack of attention throughout the hotel could be a red flag and a potential  health issue. Other observations included, dried spills on lobby floor outside the elevator floor that was never addressed during our three day stay, and parking lot trash can over spilled with trash  on Sunday and not addressed even as we left on Monday the following day.
THIS particular location needs some lovin.",4,Christopher,2023-10-13

The carpet in our room and my sister in laws rooms were horrendous. Large black spots throughout the carpet. My coffee maker didn’t work and the sink was very slow to drain. Staff was friendly and the girl doing the breakfast worked her ass off trying to keep up with all the people coming in. Trash cans outside and near the kitchen area were overfilled w trash. Need more staff to pay attention to what’s going on. Carpets need to be replaced. ,4,DANIEL,2023-10-11

"First and last time staying at this location. The worst place to stay for the amount of money I spent. Let start with checkin- I booked for a double- bed room, didn’t get it, got king size bed with a pullout bed. Told me they could accommodate a refreshment or whatever I’d like because of that mess up on their end. Tried to stay positive. With that booking, I requested extra towels and extra coffee. Didn’t receive those. Did a room check, figured things would be ok, it wasn’t. I go to take a shower there is blood on the shower curtain, someone’s hair on the shower wall, the shower is slippery, accident waiting to happen. Very low water pressure and water wasn’t hot, luke warm. Check the bedding, there is a blood stain on the comforter, the mattress has two big sagging areas on each side of the beds where you lay, the couch was shot, wasn’t comfortable at all and squeaks when you sit on it or move to get comfortable. Tried the breakfast, they didn’t have enough plates, food was still cold and half frozen. Nowhere to really sit to eat your breakfast. You could clearly hear people talking and walking down the halls and dogs barking, doors slamming, tv going in other peoples rooms, while in your own room. I wouldn’t recommend staying there.",2,Rosanna,2023-10-02

"Upon check-in were notified that the double room we had booked was unavailable.  Even though we had paid extra for this room type it was not honored. The hotel had overbooked.  This put the front desk gal in quite a bind as she had to explain this to multiple customers.  
30 minutes after check-out I realized that I had left my necklace in the room.  I called the hotel immediately and was told that the head of housekeeping would enter it into a web-based system where I would be notified that they had found it and that is where I could pay for shipping to get the item back.  I called again about 8 hours later as I had  not heard anything, but was told housekeeping would enter it.  Now it is almost 36 hours later and I still have no response.  Very disappointing.",6,Tammy,2023-10-01

I had prepaid for my room when I booked it but when I showed up at the hotel to check in and get some rest these guys had already given my room to someone else. What is the point of a reservation and prepaying if you are not going to honor our original contract? This is ridiculous! And to think that they believed by having me over pay at a cheaper hotel that it was all ok. Will never book a Hyatt room again. ,2,Justin,2023-09-17

The rating for this property needs to be updated at most a 4 or 5 of 10. A handful of staff were nice and helpful but most of the front desk staff were impolite. The property was run down and it seemed like there had recently been some type of flood or similar as everything seemed wet and humid and smelled of mold. I asked to switch rooms because mine had wet carpet and bedspreads and the next room smelled like mold. Definitely one of my worst stays ever do not recommend. ,4,Kathryn,2023-08-22

Note:
The receptionist was trying hard to find me the “least bad room”; the AC in the lobby was not working and they had fans whirling around hot air kinda like an human air fryer. The indented beds were lumpy and very worn, The AC was very noisy; I thought a Boeing 737 was about to land every time it cycled off and on and off and on etc.

I can't believe any hotel would let guests stay in a room with a carpet as nasty as the one in our room.  The fold out couch/bed was old and dirty. There was 6 of us and we ended up 3 in a bed due to the condition of the hide a bed. The frig didn't get cold and the AC was barely cool.

Close by are Papadeaux and Korean BBQ (both restaurants have excellent ratings so that's a win)!

"First, let's start by saying that you get what you payed for, but I have been in many places with fair fees way, way better than this hotel, that being a Hyatt is embarrassing. The furniture is outdated, torn and used. The first room we were given smelled bad and there was food in the fridge from previous guests. There were stains in the carpet every wherr, sofa fabric, and leather pieces. Furniture was used and abused. The second room didn't smell bad but the conditions were the same as the other one. Now if you want to rest, this is not the place if you have light sleep, the hotel is right at the edge of a big highway, even at night was bussy. The staff at the hotel was nice and the breakfast just ok. There was a extended stay further north for about the same price, that looked like a apartment complex with exellent ratings for about the same price.

"The staff were friendly and helpful. Towels were clean and bedding was clean and fresh, parking was easy so I was glad for that.

 The room was clean per se.

But paying over $400.00 one night was disappointing  for a Hyatt and at that price I did not expect the room to be so out dated and run down. Hyatt needs to visit their locations and do update. Especially for charging so much money. Very small shampoo and soap there was 3 of us definitely barely enough for once person. Carpet stained and worn and really needs to be replaced.
Doors and walls not so hot.

Hyatt used to be a nice hotel.",8,KIm,2023-03-20
"Staff is friendly but the hotel is beat.  Dirty, worn carpets, stains everywhere, dirty, old furniture and everything is dated.  The photos are not even close to accurate.  We did not feel comfortable even stepping on the carpets barefoot or with socks.

POWERFUL smell of perfume to try and mask odors.  It's right next to the freeway, luckily we had a room facing the opposite direction.

Graffitti scratched into the elevators and giant stained worn down carpets in them.

The staff were friendly and courteous but this is not what you would expect with the Hyatt name.  
This is a Motel 6 level hotel.

Love Hyatt place ,8,Tom,2023-03-17
"Our tub was not attached to the wall and allowed water to collect under the tub while showering. Tub floor was unsteady and could feel water moving under feet (beneath the tub) and water leaking out on floor from underneath tub. Also, there was a very musty smell in bathroom (possibly mold from water issue). We checked in after midnight (front desk service was pleasant) and we’re unaware of issue until showering in the morning. This should have been easily noticed by housekeeping when cleaning shower/tub. There was security overnight and felt like we may not have been staying in a safe area. Pool was very dirty. Breakfast was sufficient. Not worth over $200 per night until they remodel. Glad we only booked 1 night. We stayed at an Embassy Suites and Hyatt House for the remainder of our trip and both were wonderful thankfully. ",4,Eva,2023-03-16

"Over all is terrible! The aircon is right next to the bed, it's so noisy that we have to return it off, and the room get so hot without it. Through our stay for 8 nights, twice our room was not made. ",2,Denh,2023-03-15
"Could use a facelift. My room felt like a hotel room in the 90's. The bed had two giant body indents from overuse. Checkin was supposed to be 3, ended up finally getting a room at 5. Staff remained friendly and helpful.",6,Tyler,2023-03-15
"Property was dirty. I was moved to a worse room than the one I had booked. Freeway noise was exceptionally loud and kept me up all night. Tv remote control was broken. Staff was nice, but truly a garbage hotel for $250/night",2,Cole,2023-03-09
"Check in was easy and quick.  Nice modern exterior and interior.  Elevator was odd, lines sticking out of the ceiling as if lights were missing.  And one of my reasons picking was the free breakfast as well for easy in and out for my day.  by 9:15am Sunday the food was gone and what was left little oatmeal and potatoes which was dried out old.  Good attempt to refill asap but that took 30 minutes. Other than that fine hotel. Beds were fine, room was large enough with fridge.",10,judith,2023-03-07

"I enjoyed my experience with this hotel. Friendly staff, good breakfast, very clean, easy parking, great room etc...The only thing i would recommend, request a room that is not facing the freeway at the check in if you don't like the noisy. I will recommend this hotel to anyone and i will stay there again in the future. ",10,Fidel,2023-02-27

"I have a tough time leaving negative reviews but this property needs some serious renovations. I assumed being a Hyatt property and the price range paid that it would be like any other, but the room felt straight out of the 70’s plus stained carpets and furniture and finding hair in the towels. Staff was very kind, so that’s a plus, but was very uncomfortable with the room. ",4,Joshua,2023-02-10
Staff was wonderful. Hotel was very clean and smelled fresh. I would recommend and stay again ,10,Matthew Joseph,2023-02-07
"
Room was pretty well worn. Big stain on carpet on side of bed. Used a towel to cover it up. Curtains have splatter stains. Was this room a murder scene once?
 Bathroom tub has moldy caulk and shower was pretty much stuck to on and one temp. Sink is cracked. 
 You can tell staff works to keep place clean but this room needs an overhaul. ",8,Verified traveler,2023-02-06

"The property was nice but the pool fence was broken so they told us we could jump the fence to get in,  the pool was very dirty once staff member jumped fence so we could get in. 
My room had a leak under the storage cabinet that we didn't realize until leaving.  I told the day clerk that several of my things were ruined and she didn't seem to care at all. 
The night desk clerk Kelty, was very warm and friendly.  They were also very informative about the area.  If they hadn't been as nice as they were I probably would've checked out day 1.",8,Laurel,2023-02-04

"This hotel is very clean, and has a great location with friendly staff- not to mention a fantastic breakfast!  It has the best breakfast for a hotel that includes breakfast in the price of your stay.  The eggs, bacon, sausage and potatoes are super fresh along with a variety of sweets, fruits, juices and coffee.  The breakfast is available for several hours and it makes it easy to grab it before work during the week or activities over the weekends.  This is a super convenient hotel that is right off the freeway.  This is wonderful for ease of access; however, if you are on the freeway side of the hotel, you will hear cars.  As an urban dweller, I'm used to this and it sounded like white noise but it may bother some.  The room was a nice suite with both a desk and table to use and small sink, counterspace and mini fridge if you wanted to store food/drinks.  The furniture and carpet have not been updated and look a bit dated, but everything works and is super clean so it didn't bother me.  The helpfulness of the staff is to be commended; I did have a toilet issue and they resolved it as soon as it was reported.  I highly recommend the hotel and look forward to staying here again on my next trip to the area.",10,Verified traveler,2023-01-16

The hotel was definitely clean and cozy it was very quiet. As far as for an overall cleanliness it did seem a bit run down like the carpet had a lot of spots on it. I noticed the lights kept flickering on and off in the room. Also the air conditioning was not working properly. The one thing I didn't appreciate the most was the fact that the front desk guy just kept asking for a deposit And he had me sign a bunch of paperwork which made me feel uncomfortable because it made me feel that he didn't want me there considering I paid for 3 nights and it was over $500. ,10,Rachel,2023-01-11

Room was old and tattered. Toilet stopped up. Peeling in the bathroom. Carpet was filthy. Couch was stained. Peeling wooden furniture. Calcium deposits on faucets. Customer service was very nice until we had to pay a 50.00 early checking fee for 1.5 hours on a pre booked room that was ready for check-in.,6,INGA,2023-01-02
