"The only improvement this hotel could have would be to have a hot tub! I usually try to pick hotels with hot tubs.

The room was laid out very nice. Super comfortable! And the breakfast lady was so friendly!",10,VALERIE,2025-09-25

"Was convenient for where we had wanted to be late the day before, or early the next day.
The building was showing signs of wear.  Whoever thought squeezing a scond bed into the room (519) was a good idea should be shown what is left after you do so: too much furniture, no room to get around or even relax on the furniture that is there.",8,Matt,2025-08-17

"The room was nice. The pics on site shows a different set-up of the room. Thought the wall would be there between the sofa bed and bed, so my uncle would have ‚Äúsome‚Äù privacy from my mom. It worked out and everything was fine. No biggie! ",8,Sheratta,2025-08-10

Pull out bed for sleeping a 5th person in our family was a great additional benefit.  Rooms were clean, climate controlled, and could be kept very dark for sleeping.

A person was asleep in my assigned room. I was given a room number and keycard. Actually open the door to find someone asleep. Needless to say I had to go back to the front desk and wait to be assigned another room. As the front desk assured me no one was supposed to be in the room. ,4,Kayla,2025-04-06
"The hotel property and rooms were in great condition, very high quality, welcoming and visually appealing. I felt safe in and around the property. The hotel staff were very friendly and pleasant to interact with; they genuinely appeared to like their job and it showed in how they interacted with the guests. The rooms were spacious and comfortable to be in. There was a large, comfortable couch to sit on, a desk area to sit at or relax at, a large spacious bathroom with a small walk in closet, the beds were decently comfortable to sleep on and there was in-room coffee (there were even real glasses to drink out of which elevated the hotel experience to a more luxurious experience). The workout room had plenty of machines, quite new so you knew they would work and not be wobbly to be on. There were 2 treadmills, an elliptical and sit-down bike along with free weights. The breakfast was quite high quality and there was a large healthy assortment including such things as eggs, hot oatmeal, yogurt, milk, fruits and waffles. It was a bit disappointing when a large number of people were in the breakfast bar area because seating was hard to find at times especially when people wouldn‚Äôt leave after eating or a few people were spaced out taking up a large seating area but it would still be comfortable to eat in your room because of the desk area or coffee table at the couch‚Ä¶.the rooms were that big and comfortable definitely making an extended stay comfortable and worth it.

"When arrived, the staff was very generous. However, once we got to our room, we looked around,  and decided to leave. The room felt unclean. The ceiling  had waterstains that was recently patched, and bowing. Near the AC unit were a couple of dead cockroaches. We just didnt feel comfortable sleeping there, so we checked out immediately.

,10,Angela,2025-02-28
"Great place to stay - wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer! Only odd thing was that in the room with two queen size beds and a sleeper sofa there was also a desk the length of the bed that was pushed right up against the side of the bed. It seemed a bit odd. Also, there was no light above the little coffee bar, and the closet was in the bathroom, which was also strange. If we were ever to stay there again, we would get a room with a single king size bed, perhaps that would be a bit more comfortable.",10,Susan,2025-02-25

"Room was nice and comfortable / returned to my room the second day and found bugs inside the shower lighting  and above the light cover. I got out of the shower quickly only to find another large bug on the mirror!!
I was utterly shocked to find bugs in a Marriot Hotel. The staff was very apologetic and moved us to another room. But I still found myself very uncomfortable even when moved to another room. Needles to say, I will NOT be staying at another Marriot hotel!!",4,Lillye,2025-02-02

We were disappointed after thinking we were getting a deal when we learned THE ENTIRE hotel water would be shut down at 10am-12pm essentially forcing us to check out one night get away. Completely dishonest marketing for the variance in pricing. I travel around the world on Expedia bookings as a Platinum level member and the hotel should have notified us prior to arrival and check in so we could shift plans. ,4,Veronica,2024-10-21

Our stay was very nice. Room 611 - ceiling was leaking on us - right over the bed! It was raining really hard that night! We had to move the bed about 2 feet away from wall and slept that way b/c it was late and we were not going to move rooms at that time. Also - the shower faucet and handle are loose and wobble alot. There needs to be more light over the counter with the coffee pot and fridge - it's very dark there. The staff was great.

She told me my room was ready and I could check in right then. The room was fairly on the small side compared to other hotel rooms with king size bed I‚Äôve been in. Still, everything was clean and cozy. Breakfast options were good. The hot food options varied a little each day I was there. This was nice except I had missed the hot croissant sandwiches that were there the first morning of my visit, and hoped they would be there again but they weren‚Äôt. All of the staff passed by or talked with were friendly. The location was absolutely great! So many restaurant options within walking distance and retail stores a short drive away.

"The staff were very welcoming and helpful. There are a few choices of places to eat, and the free breakfast at the hotel is very good. I like the location.  It is right off of Interstate 275, and about 20 minutes to Cincinnati, OH.
This is the second time we have stayed here, and I'm sure we will again.

"This place is old and it shows - 
Driveway leading to the property is in Very poor condition.
Room had - Rusty shower - Lights not working - Clock not set to correct time. HVAC unit looks like it had been repaired and not put back together - Bathroom sink drain was slow to drain - Entrance area outside could use a cleaning dirty - old gum",6,Charlie,2023-09-18

"The breakfast is among the worst examples of free hot breakfast. If you are counting on this, make plans for something else. Scrambled eggs were minced into tiny balls. Sausage sitting in giant puddles of grease. Simply inedible. No traditional dairy or half n half for coffee, only pre sweetened coffee mate.

No housekeeping service for a three night stay. 

Only enough towels and wash cloths in the room for 3 people even though our rooms was booked for 4 people.

Shower head was coming off the wall.

Overall, I‚Äôll find a different place to stay when I‚Äôm back in the area.",8,Scot,2023-09-04

"I checked in with Sandra and she was a 20 out of 10. The room when I checked in was clean, there was water puddling up in the shower room but paid it no mind at the time, and by the end of the first day and a shower there was quite a lot of water and it was nit draining. I woke up the next morning with itchy bites on my arm and ankles. Come to find out these were bed bug bites. That is why I left a day early. No offers to refund my money and I definitely wasnot going to pay a fee to move rooms.This was terrible, terrible. I have pictures of bed bug and my bites. I am 53 years old and travel a lot. Never had this happen. Quite embarrassing to have my MD tell me these are bed bug bites. Something needs to happen here!!! If the staff could not help me then I'm hoping the manager or Area manager can!",2,andrea,2023-09-02

"Staff were nice and friendly.
Breakfast staff were very attentive and continuously restocking the food and supplies, and cleaning. Good selection of hot and cold breakfast items.",8,Robert,2023-08-30
"The staff was amazing. In every interaction they went above and beyond what I expected.

The building however showed obvious signs of poor and rushed craftsmanship. There were obvious repairs to walls and even the elevator interior that were very poorly done. One elevator had exposed drywall screws to hold up an interior decorative panel. There was no drywall in the elevator.

 The plumbing had low pressure. We had a toilet that wouldn‚Äôt turn off and eventually flooded the bathroom. The staff helped immediately with moving us to a different room. 

The  staff was very good to the point that I would hire one of they away if we didn‚Äôt live on the other side of the country. But I will not stay in this hotel ever again and definitely will not recommend it to anyone.",4,Cliff,2023-08-28
The owner of this hotel is a creep. He walked in on my mother and two young daughters at 9pm at night claiming he needed to charge the locks on the door. He also claimed his computer system showed no one was checked into that room but then later claimed ‚Äúhe was supposed to be rooming in the room she was in but couldn‚Äôt because it was booked‚Äù there were many holes in this story and after this happened with no knock on the door and him unlocking and walking in on her and my daughters already in bed they were traumatized. This clown refused to refund us our $150 for the night and the front desk clerk claimed it was just a misunderstanding and it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. He refused to be any sort of apologetic for the incident and when i suggested he try to understand where i was coming from and why i was livid that a grown man was entering a room with a woman and small children he says ‚Äúwell you didn‚Äôt know if i was a man or woman coming in‚Äù which is completely beside the point. You don‚Äôt walk into someone‚Äôs hotel room unannounced at 9pm. The only hospitality in this entire place was the housekeepers running the free breakfast. After letting other families in the hallway what happened they assured us that the owner gave them the creeps and really bad vibes as well. I‚Äôd highly recommend finding another place to stay in the area if you have children or care about your families well being. This place is a joke. We gladly moved over to the Hampton inn down the street with no issues. ,2,Hannah,2023-08-27

"This hotel is convenient located close to highway, so you can commute easily. On the other side if your room is on the same side with the highway, you will hear all the traffic like you are sitting in the middle of highway.
I have to say, it‚Äôs been a long time since I have seen such nice staff in a hotel. Kudos to them to keep so kind in these times when people got so mean.
The hotel needs some upgrades. Overall is a decent hotel with great breakfast choices.",8,GABRIELA,2023-08-14
"We were quite disappointed with this property.  First, the telephone in the room had no dial tone and was inoperable. I reported the problem at the front desk and was told that maintenance would be notified.  Second, the bathtub spout was detached from the wall, and the toilet seat was broken. Again, I was told that maintenance would be notified.  They did not offer another room, and after two days, no one had addressed the problems. Most hotels keep a folder of information about the property and/or surrounding venues, but there was nothing anywhere in the room.  The only ice machine and vending in the building was on the ground floor.  Every part of the building was dirty, from the dining area to the elevator to the windows, with fingerprints and refuse unswept from day 1.  I will not recommend this property to anyone, nor will I ever stay there again.",4,Steven,2023-08-13

"DBL Queen room was a bit outdated.  Ceiling was crumbling in one small spot, but not real big deal.  The two queen beds, while comfortable, had a slight roll to the center of the mattress divot in them.  King size room here our last stay was fantastic however.",8,Brandon,2023-08-10

"Property was clean.  Check in staff was excellent.  Room had a few issues.  There was not mirror other than the bathroom which made getting ready in the morning with three people difficult. The handle on the inside of the bathroom door was off, so shutting the door took effort. The drain to the bathroom sink was missing.  The shower curtain was so long it hung in the tub and you stepped on it. The shampoo and conditioner bottles were so small there was only enough for one person, thank goodness we brought extra with us.  The overall space was clean and neat. I would stay again if ever in the area.",10,Laura,2023-08-07

Our stay was good but the only problem I have is we always request room 104 which is handycap room and easy to park by pool door. They never give me the room even when they say they will.  My mother is 84 years old  and her wheelchair or walker fits that room. She can shower and sit on the bath bench. ,8,Kathy,2023-08-02

"I will give kudos that the staff called me to alert me that a room was available earlier than the check-in time.  When I arrived I was told my room was 417, however, the key would not work.  So I go to the front office and the same attendant tried to make it seem as if I couldn‚Äôt read her handwriting saying her ‚Äú7‚Äù looks like a 9.  So my room supposedly 419 but she clearly told me 417 and wrote on the key slip.  So I finally get to my room go back out to grab a bite to eat, come back and again I can‚Äôt use the key.  This happened at least 5 times during this short stay.  I didn‚Äôt have the key near my phone or debit card so that was not the issue.  It was very annoying having to go to the front desk repeatedly to have the key redone.  There also needs to be some renovating done at the hotel.  The tub in the room had cracks and what look to be a bug plastered under some white adhesive.  I was not impressed with the stay there.  Wouldn‚Äôt recommend",4,Marvin,2023-07-03
