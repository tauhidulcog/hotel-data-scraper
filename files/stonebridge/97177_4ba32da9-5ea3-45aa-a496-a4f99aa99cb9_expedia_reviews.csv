"We had a wonderful stay! Team member David was super nice and welcoming. Our queen balcony room was small & cozy but the wraparound balcony was amazing. The view of Queens is nice, but keep in mind sunrise is on that side of the building and temps may be warm if you are spending time in the room during the day in the summer. We would have given 5 stars, but our friends had some trouble with their Manhattan view room -- David did his best to make it right, and I believe it was a satisfactory visit for all. Overall great stay -- neat/clean/quiet, comfortable beds, good food in the restaurant, close proximity to subways. Best views in floors 10+. Please check shower & sink levers in room 1004. We will definitely consider the Boro Hotel for our next trip to the US Open tennis tournament!",8,Christy,2025-08-31
"Our room was clean, bed comfortable. 
Staff works hard to oblige requests.
Wish they would have more obvious notice that pets are allowed in rooms as I definitely would have requested pet free room. Staying here because daughter has a dog!!",10,Jane,2025-08-30

"I had a decent stay at the Boro hotel, my only concern was the condition of my room. You should not feel like someone was in the room before you and it did. There were dried pieces of rose petals on the floor, long strain of hair in the shower and items missing from the room that should be standard like a tv remote. 

Seems like the checklist wasn’t complete. It would be also great for microwaves to be better accessible for guests. I love the location of the hotel and what it had to offer like the restaurant and cafe and the staff was more than accommodating but the room was left to be desired. ",6,Cesily,2025-08-16

"I live in Queens and was pleasantly surprised to find this hotel so close by. It’s super cute and unique , not looking like a typical chain hotel. Everyone was nice and personable. It’s about a 10 minute walk to multiple subway stops and then a short trip (2-4 stops depending on the line) to get into Manhattan. If you choose a ride share, it’s a 15 - 20 min ride over the 59th St bridge to get to Midtown. It’s in the middle of a popular neighborhood with tons of restaurants nearby.  Also, it’s way cheaper than staying in the City and really close. Attached are photos of the skyline from our balcony. ",10,David,2025-06-13

Was advised we can get extension the evening upon booking and the following day was declined because conveniently the manager I spoke to the previous evening was off and they “needed the room”. Upon leaving the receptionist I spoke to about the extension and told me she can’t… she called another resident up to their room and asked if they wanted to extend I was livid. I left and I will never go back. That was my experience. Place was nice inside only ,4,Fairy,2025-05-09

"Stay was comfortable and the room was big, especially for New York. My only annoyance is that maid service is not standard daily. We were asked upon arrival if we'd like daily service. We said we would, and it was not provided. On day 3 of our 5 day stay we explicitly asked and the room was not serviced until we went downstairs and asked for a THIRD time. It was just an interesting approach. We also had to ask for towels daily. If that was fixed, would have been a flawless stay. ",8,Amanda,2025-03-26

"The best part of the hotel is David at the front desk, he is amazing. Other than that the stay itself was pretty average. The room smelt like cigarettes when we entered, but it’s okay because I brought a candle with me that got rid of the odor. The room was nice, I did expect it to be a bit bigger though. On my last day, 3/23 at 11:39AM someone knocked on the door to remind me of checkout hours, that’s a first. Out of all the hotel rooms I’ve stayed in, no one has ever knocked on the door during my check out process. I paid a good amount of money for this so I expected better. Very nice hotel, but would not stay again. ",6,Louis,2025-03-23

And got there and still had to give them $200 ….. it’s refundable but of course takes 5-7 business days to even get into your acc again. I’m still waiting for mine.

"My partner and I did a staycation at the Boro hotel on a snowy and cold day! We had a breathtaking view of the queens boro bridge and other skyscrapers in the city.

The location was another plus—conveniently situated near top attractions, shopping, and public transportation, making it easy to explore the area.

"This property is way overrated. For the money its not something we expected. Room was dated, bathroom door eaten by the humidity, dust everywhere. Be aware there is no storage in the room. Few hangers one chair and desk, that is all! . If you travel as single person you might be ok. Anything more then that will struggle with storing clothes and belongings. Also, one elevator was broken during our stay. We were lucky to be on the 3rd floor but if you are on any higher floors good luck with being on time anywhere. No one seemed to have also cared from the staff and Hotel of this issue. ",6,Lejla,2025-02-17

"Best thing about the property was the view we had.  The room  a bit depressing, we stayed in the king balcony Manhattan view. Had dinner downstairs at Beebe’s that wasn’t bad not much options because of limited street parking had to park 3 blocks up and walk. The owner walked in while we were dining in Beebe’s but didn’t greet us only greeted who he wanted, well his lost saw him on a YouTube vlog advertising the rooms and that’s why I even considered going, wish I had read all the reviews first like no mini fridge lol. My husband and I felt the room was a bit depressing  2 pillows were flat and flimsy, bed very uncomfortable I tossed all night. Nothing much really in the room to brighten your spirits and small tv so far away, a bit dark in the hallway. ",6,Jerome,2025-01-13

"The property is in a relatively quiet neighborhood of LIC, 3-4 blocks from 2 different metro stations, and the property is clean. Room is clean and decent size considering that it is so close to NYC. Street parking is possible although it takes some time. NP.
Two minor complaints: 1. the queen bed feels narrower than my queen size bed at home for two people. 2. we smell strong smoke/pot one of the two nights, likely through the HVAC from people upstairs/downstairs. Not sure what the hotel could do about enforcing the non-smoking policy. Otherwise, it is convenient and clean.
BTW, they charge a hotel fee when checking in.",8,Nanying,2025-01-02

"I wanted to love this hotel, however that was impossible as the beds were entirely uncomfortable. I woke up the next morning feeling like I need a massage. The room was much smaller than expected. The water in the sink would barely drain. Also, we upgraded to the Manhattan view, only to get a glimpse of the manhattan view. It was supposed to be no smoking however it smelled like weed on my floor. 

On the bright side, parking was easy. I loved the 12pm check out which allowed us more time to sleep. Balcony was cool, would’ve been better if there was a seating area on the balcony. 

Overall- 4/10. Got the job done for a one night, barely in the room kinda night but I won’t be returning. ",4,Andrea,2024-11-11

"We enjoyed our stay at Boro Hotel. Our view of the city was nice. It's a short walk to the #Subway but there are plenty of shops and eateries within walking distance. The hotel lighting inside was dimmer than I like it. I would've liked a refrigerator in the room but didn't realize until leaving that we could've requested one. The rooms are stylish but the bathrooms don't insulate any noise. Most of the staff was pleasant and helpful. The gym is small but it had the basic essentials. The hotel offered 1 free glass of wine in the evenings but we didn't realize this either until our last night. I didn't really like the wine so I guess it worked out. They offer free coffee in the morning with milk and sugar or sweetners, but no creamer. There is a bar and restaurant but ate at other local spots. We enjoyed our overall stay and plan to stay at Boro Hotel when we visit NY, again.",8,Eric,2024-10-07

"This is my 2nd time staying at the Boro. I do love this hotel! It's modern and has great amenities.  The staff are always helpful and kind. My only complaint is the smell of cigarettes and weed that comes through the vents. This happened on both occasions when I stayed at the hotel. There is a strict no smoking policy at the hotel, but I'm unsure where the smell is coming from through the vents. We have told the front desk, and it's not a big issue for us to switch rooms, but it's a bit off-putting especially since my partner and I do not smoke. ",8,Ngoc An,2024-10-02

"The view towards Mannhatten from the higher levels of the building is cool, but that's pretty much it. Guests should not expect any kind of service beyond what is explicitly described on the website. My wife needed nail polish remover, which was one of the amenities described as ""available upon request"" but when we asked for it, the lady at the front desk just disinterestedly stated that she didn't have any. We needed the laundry service which was advertised, but the staff seemed overwhelmed with organizing that or even giving us basic information about it. Thanks to constant contact it worked out just in time, but it wasn't a smooth service experience in any way. The whole place is clearly meant to have a minimalist/modern design, but it is not executed thoughtfully. The rooms are sparsely furnished and there are few outlets, most of which are placed awkwardly and one of them did not work. The balcony did not have proper flooring so you cannot really stand without shoes and no seating. There's also an awkward gap between the mattress and the headboard of the bed. The bathroom door doesn't quite fit, cannot be locked and doesn't provide noise isolation whatsoever. No trash bag in the bathroom bin, which isn't thoughtful towards female guests. Shower is misconstrued so it changes temperature on its own. Finally the hair dryer literally went off in flames during use. On our last day however, the guy at the front desk was more helpful. For the price we would have expected more.",4,Verified traveler,2024-09-26

"Had a great visit to NY.  Stayed at the Boro because it has a restaurant and a lovely rooftop bar. The rooms are comfortable, the beds are very comfortable and city views are very nice. The showers are excellent. They do not have mini fridges in the rooms so if you have leftovers from a restaurant, you most likely have to discard them. The food is very good at the hotel restaurant, but staffing seemed short. Laundry service is available but not terribly timely when awaiting return. Overall this is a very good spot for comfortable rooms and good restaurant bar and morning coffee service. It’s convenient to great local spots offering excellent international dining and above average cocktail bars. Also close to the subway with proximity to Mets Stadium and the US Open complex. It’s clean and safe and comfortable with a cool “industrial chic” vibe.",8,Gwen,2024-09-03

"The staff at the Boro Hotel were amazing. David handled our check-in/out, and he was wonderful, as was every other interaction I had with the staff. I booked through Expedia and had no issues. 

The amenities were very nice. The gym is a small spot, open 24/7 with your room card. It has a treadmill, elliptical, heavy bag, yoga mats, bosu ball, and a large set of dumbbells. I used it 4 mornings during my week there, and only overlapped my time with one other guest (i.e. it wasn't crowded). It was small but plenty. And it was IMPRESSIVELY CLEAN! As was the rest of the hotel. 

Beebe's restaurant (first floor, rooftop, room service, and lobby cafe) had solid food. The lobby cafe makes great lattes, and also offers complimentary hot drip coffee to guests each morning. The pastries appeared to be brought in daily from a local bakery (perhaps?) and the chocolate croissants were downright impeccable. 

We stayed on the 6th floor with a balcony. For me, I enjoyed being able to step out and feel the weather. It also gave me privacy to take phone calls. 

The Boro has what is, in my opinion, an extremely underrated feature - on the basement level (where the gym is located) there are 4 private bathrooms. So easy to hop off the elevator and have some privacy, particularly if your room's bathroom/shower is already in use.

There is also a microwave in the basement.

No gift shop or vending machine, but it's NYC so there is a bodega on the next corner!

We loved it here and will return!",10,Andrea,2024-09-01

"This hotel was a great vibe. My girlfriend and I just wanted a nice chill spot to spend our anniversary and this was perfect. Starting from the guest service at the check in desk, to the room with its high ceilings, balcony, and city view, to the elegant bathroom and shower. And Beebes restaurant was awesome. We ate there 4 times that day. The manager was also very personable and checked in to make sure we were enjoying our experience. 10/10 and definitely will be doing this again. ",10,Elijah,2024-08-28

"I arrived late at night because of a canceled flight. When I checked in the desk clerk said nothing...but, when I got to my room there was a notice that there would be NO WATER from 8-10AM the next day.

I returned to the desk. I asked for a discount, since I would only be in the hotel from midnight until noon. He said NO. And, when I asked for an extended checkout to allow for more time for showering, etc. when the water was restored. He gave me a rate sheet starting at $100.

Unbelievable.

NO offer of food in the restaurant. No discount. No extended time. NOTHING!!!

It's too bad...because the hotel was pretty nifty and I would have returned in the future.",4,Cathryn,2024-08-21

"I stayed at this hotel w/ my boyfriend for two nights, as we were in town for a concert. Upon entering the hotel, we both loved the vibe & the look of the lobby, w/ all of the staff being extremely kind, attentive, & helpful. We got the corner room on the seventh floor. 
The room was cute, but looked like it had not been properly cleaned (wooden floors needed to be mopped, bed frame had loads of dust in corners, pee in the toilet/under seat & base, & outlet next to bed had a cracked wall with the drywall crumbling everywhere). 
Bathroom was spacious but water sprays out of the shower which made floors extremely slippery & dangerous due to it being tile & a glass wall w/ no handle bar. 
The Balcony (Manhattan View) was cool, but it’s made of metal slats w/ NO bottom to catch anything so it was freaky being out there (if you dropped something it would be gone; not safe for children).
The Rooftop bar was the best part of the hotel in my opinion! The view is beyond amazing, the couches, music & set up is great. The bartenders were terrific; making it a great first night, just wish they had longer summer hours. 
 Lastly we encountered some great staff during our stay which made up for the room not being up to par at almost $700 for 2 nights. I would like to commend Renee for her amazing hospitality, kindness & making us feel welcome & at home in NY being from Boston! ",8,Jannah,2024-08-14

This hotel is great! It was quiet and peaceful. The staff was amazing. They helped me find a corner store and then lent me an umbrella when it was raining.

"Such a great hotel. Situated in a quiet residential area with convenience stores ( liquor too) & restaurants nearby. Friendly helpful staff , amazing restaurant on the main floor , rooftop lounge & bar with amazing views , free coffee /tea in the mornings & free glass of wine in the restaurant at night. The room are spacious, ours had a balcony & view of manhattan. Toiletries provided & you can request a mini fridge. The walls are thin so if you have a noisy neighbor, expect to hear them. Take ear plugs Incase. You can order food to your room from the restaurant & they’ll deliver it to the rooftop patio also. I do wish they would lock up our luggage on checkout day instead of having to leave it in the foyer where anyone could steal it though. And the rooftop only opens after 5pm, wish it had been open for lunch. Other than that, I absolutely loved my stay there & will definitely go back. ",10,Julia,2024-08-02

We only spent one night. We were on the go. Its proximity to main attractions and center city on foot made things really convenient and enjoyable. Style, location, service, convenience and quiet were key.

"Staff was nice and the place was clean. But for the price, the room was not all that good. 

My main concerns were:
- balcony was connected to other room balconies and the door did not seal well. You could hear cars honking at ground level from the 12th floor. 
- mattress on the bed was not very comfortable. 
- the walls were THIN, and not just the ones connected by doors. I could almost hear my neighbor fart in the room next to me with no connecting door. At first I thought someone was standing right outside my room carrying on a conversation but realized it was my neighbor just talking on the phone. Had to use ear plugs to get to sleep that night. 
- TV was tiny and no fridge in the room",6,Verified traveler,2024-03-24
Check in was easy and fast. The front desk when checking my husband and I in heard it was our 19th anniversary and he upgraded our room from a queen to king size bed which was very sweet. The food was delicious. Will definitely book another stay. It was a nice staycation type of stay. Home a way from home feeling being we are queens residents. Just as parents we needed alone time and this stay was perfect for that! ,10,Lissette,2024-03-23

Wonderful staff and cleanly. However pictures farrrrr sell this place. Everything feels super cheap and comparable to sleeping in an abandoned auto shop. I couldn’t catch a night of sleep on what felt like cardboard! And paid 30$ for a “rose petal” setup that made my boyfriend and I burst out in laughter due to the one pack of faux roses from dollar general that were thrown on the bed. Could change the channel on the tv because the cable box was place improperly; which management was aware of. I was instructed to get up and point the remote in a certain angle. Basically we made the best of it. ,6,Mellisa,2024-01-24

"The industrial aesthetic and environmental no frills considerations of the Boro Hotel make it efficient. The room was clean and comfortable. However, the furniture, environment, and amenities are not what I would expect for a 4-star hotel. I felt that the nearby Hyatt and Hilton Home2Suites (where I have also stay in the past 3 months) were more comfortable. This was a little disappointing for my 4-star splurge. ",6,Emily,2024-01-15

"The good: A modern hotel with spacious rooms and an industrial, uniquely minimalist look and feel. Close to the subway and convenient access to Manhattan. Very safe neighborhood; anyone claiming otherwise just isn’t used to being in an urban environment. 

The bad: Unfortunately I felt that there is much left to be desired.  For the price I paid and the listing description, I had higher expectations. In my opinion this isn’t a luxury hotel but rather a 3 star claiming to be a 4 star. I noticed the rooms needed a lot of maintenance; for example the chair and tv had scratch marks. The bathroom door was also rotting at the bottom due to its close proximity to the shower. The listing claims the rooms are soundproof, but if that’s the case why did I hear my neighbors crystal clear - everything from high heels, their voices, toilet flushing and more. The fact you have to ask for a refrigerator is also ridiculous. Finally, the practice of charging resort fees needs to end. I made it clear to the receptionist that I wasn’t going to use any of the resort fee associated amenities, yet they still said it was required. Just a way to increase revenue and in the end wasn’t a lot, but is one of those junk fees that makes comparison shopping more difficult for the consumer and hopefully gets banned in the future.

I’m not one to usually write bad reviews but I felt it was important to share my experience with others. I won’t be back.",4,Sean,2023-12-24

"This was our second time staying.  Picking a room with the New York skyline is a must.  Floor to ceiling glass with a balcony that you can step out onto.  The hotel rooms are in great condition and very clean.  We haven't tried the restaurant yet, but in the morning you'll find magnificent pastries from a nearby bakery.   If I had to complain about something it would be the lack of furniture given that the rooms are big enough.  An arms chair and a bench for your baggage would be a great perk.
Otherwise a great place to stay.",10,sabrina,2023-12-21

"It’s a nice find. Close to the subway, many rideshare vehicles nearby in minutes. Very clean. I like the hotel design of the Hotel, I travel A LOT! I call it Euro-Urban-Industrial-Chic LOL. Parking is a challenge if you have a car. Their lot is 5 blocks away and they have no valet. Rooms could use better lighting, but during the daytime it’s ok as windows are HUGE and many rooms have some type of balcony. The battery that operates the room safe was dead, but I didn’t need it so I didn’t report it. Would I stay here again? Yes.
That said, there are many boutique hotels in the area and next time I might try another. I prefer properties like this to Hampton Suites for example.",8,John,2023-12-02

"For a boutique hotel nothing felt special about it. It has gorgeous architecture and views, but the room truly is a blank canvas. For the basic room which is still 300-400 per night there is not even a fridge. The bed was uncomfortable both a hard and almost creaky mastress and plushness of the sheets and bedding was absent. You could hear the pipe work making it a loud stay. (IE every time the room next to you used the water you hear almost  rattle sound in the pipes) My room was also next to laundry which for cleaning towels and sheets was excessively noisey.

The roof for more Manhattan views is also only open in the summer- something that is not advertised. ",6,Verified traveler,2023-11-13
"Felt like a crappy deal, for a less than mediocre place, in an OK-at-best area.

LIC is very convenient & still up & coming (this & the surrounding blocks are still in progress).

The hotel itself feels cheaply done. Like you think you’re getting a nice place but everything looks and feels…. Meh. They use the “industrial” look to mask for using inexpensive materials and apparently, poor craftsmanship.
For example, the sliding pocket door kept getting stuck in place or coming off the rails. I literally was trapped in the bathroom for a few minutes!

The staff are kind - I has to ask to make sure there weren’t pets in the room recently (since we had someone with severe allergies) and they made sure to check the system for bookings within the month that were pet-free. That was nice.

The bed (mattress) was luxe feeling, but the bedding felt like hospital quality thread counts and softness.

"This hotel appears to have been a repurposed parking garage, bare cement ceilings with exposed pipes and plumbing. Definitely a minimalist modern design and furnishings, but almost too much so. Large rooms with two very comfortable beds. A simple desk and chair next to the TV. Spare bathrooms with simply a toilet, bathroom sink, and a walk-in shower with no door, just a glass partition separated from the sink area. But no other furnishings such as a dresser, a closet, no mini-fridge and no microwave. So the rooms are not worth the high price. But the restaurant, BeeBees on the first floor was excellent, food was delicious, and reasonably priced. And the staff was excellent attentive and helpful.

"Zofia (at the front desk) was the highlight of our stay. She was so kind and hospitable.
Overall, the hotel is really nice. Great roof deck. It's in a bit of an odd area. Not a lot  of dining/shopping directly in walking distance, but the hotel itself is very modern and clean. Prepare to take the train (4 blocks away) or ubers if you need to get to the city (15 minute ride )We really struggled with the bed. It was so uncomfortable. Kind of like sleeping on a futon. Asked to move rooms, but were told that all the beds are the same. If you have a sensitive back, this may not be the best fit for you. No vegan/gf options on the restaurant menu so we ordered out a lot. Appreciated water in the room each day and for the most part, very quiet. Unfortunately, on the last evening of our stay a very loud party was happening until 2am in the room next door. It was the only day we struggled with noise. ",8,Heidi,2023-08-01

"Highly recommend the Boro Hotel for a budget-friendly, convenient, and easy stay. I wish I were able to give more stars than this platform displays. I will return, and this hotel has become my favorite experience in Queens. 

This hotel is located near several metro stops and highways to reach Manhattan or Brooklyn, making it convenient to travel locally. If you prefer to cycle around town, there are several Citi bike stations around this area. There is also a rooftop that is accessible and has stunning views of Manhattan's cityscape. The rooftop bar is outdoors and is perfect for a drink or hanging out with friends. A cafe near the front desk is also great for on-the-go coffee needs. From 6 to 7 pm, the bar offers a complimentary glass of wine every day.

The hotel staff have gone above and beyond and are exceptionally friendly. Upon arrival, a front desk receptionist named David upgraded my room, displaying the fantastic cityscape. David has made my stay extremely easy and welcoming. Though my rooms had no fridge, they provided basic needs and were very clean.

I stayed at this hotel for my first night in New York, but had to return after discovering a hidden camera in my Airbnb. After explaining my situation, the front desk gave me another warm welcome and assured me I was in a safe space.

I could compliment for hours about this hotel. If you need that one review that persuades you to stay, this is it. Stay here.",10,Ashley,2023-07-26

Der Safe war nicht verankert und somit leider nicht brauchbar. Ein von zwei Aufzügen war an mehreren Tagen defekt. Von der Rooftopbar hat man zwar einen schönen Ausblick, aber auch die Rooftopbar braucht ein Refresh. Im Übrigen würde ich keine Cocktails im Einmal-Plastikbecher erwarten.

"The Boro Hotel is a beautiful, modern space. The rooms are sparse but have a industrial chic feel. The common spaces are very well kept and appealing. ",10,Kevin,2023-04-07

"Staff wasn't clear for reasons for charges, certain basic amenities weren't in the room such as toothpaste, tooth brush, etc. There wasn't a fridge for our beverages.",6,C,2023-03-20

The room did not have heat. I had to call twice and they only brought me a heater which did not help warm the room. This property needs to improve its hospitality and take their guests seriously. ,4,Shafira,2023-02-28
Had another incredible stay at the property and decided to get myself an upgrade for the Manhattan view and balcony. It was well worth it — seeing some of the best views of the city I've ever seen (both during the day and night). ,10,Mennlay,2023-02-27
"I enjoyed my stay at The Boro Hotel. The property felt modern and the rooms were spacious. The trip into Manhattan is relatively quick on public transport, and it is helpful that there are multiple subway options. I did not explore the surrounding area much, but it did not seem like there was as lot going on. The restaurant in the hotel was quiet for dinner and the food was decent if a guest is not looking to venture out far. ",8,Marvin,2023-02-22

"Awesome views, friendly staff, nice restaurant.  Rooms are a little industrial, but that’s the vibe.  Really like this place.",10,Rich,2023-02-06
"The room, 1106, was basically perfect for me. The bed was outrageously comfortable. The views and small balcont were awesome.  The bathroom was pristine and very chic.  The towels were great. The in room safe was also nice to have, though it was nit permanently affixed to anything. 

The bar and dining room were incredible!! Bebee's serves amazing food and drink.

A few notes, however. The room was so compact that there was no place to sit comfortably - it was either the desk chair or the bed, that's it. Also, it would have been great to have a small fridge in the room, though i dont know where it could have fit. Lastly, i could have used more hangers.",10,Richard,2023-02-04

"Before booking I read somewhere this was a new hotel and it's 4 stars. Upon arriving there is barely any signs of entrance with raised stone paving which makes it very difficult to roll luggages on and an old heavy door with a deppressing baby blue color. There is no one to welcome you or help you with your luggages. The staff are rude and the hotel itself is an old building which they remideled the outside to look modern and for inside all they did was they removed ceiling and wall sheeting along with flooring to expose the concrete and they just polished the concrete to make it look cool. The paint and finishes are cheap looking and the entire hotel smells like mold. The first room we checked in on the 9th floor smelled like cigarettes because someone on the balcony and next door was smoking and we could smell it. They then gave us a other room on the 4th floor and it smelled like burnt oil and onions. We figured out the kitchen ventilation units were under our room. When we complained they told us they can't control that and we asked for air freshners and they never delivered it to us. There isn't even anyone to help with luggages to your room, the hallways are very tiny and looks like a prison. I also asked for a water boiler and they never brought it to our room do we had to go down and borrow one. Wanted to boil some hot water for my tea and as soon as I opened their water boiler I wanted to throw up. It was rusty and smelly inside. The sheets also had stains on them.",2,Ashkan,2023-01-02
