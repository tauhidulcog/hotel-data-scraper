Customer service was great! The breakfast was also great but felt rushed. The workers literally closed the area at 10am. I understand there is a time schedule but there werenâ€™t many guests eating and they could have closed the area more subtle not so abruptly.,10,Celia,2025-01-11

This is a great property. My only complaint was that they turned the water off for several hours an the TV were not working due to the hurricane. I feel as though some type of compensation should have been offered. Which we paid through a third party so the hotel was not able to offer us any compensation.,8,dj,2024-07-26
"Terrible Experience - Do Not Stay Here!
I had a horrible experience at this hotel. During my stay, my car was vandalized in the hotel parking lot. Two windows were broken, and several tools I had inside were stolen. When I reported the incident to the hotel management, they were completely unhelpful and refused to offer any refund or compensation for the damage and theft.
The lack of security and the hotel's indifference to such a serious issue forced me to change hotels. This entire ordeal was incredibly stressful and costly. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Stay away for your own safety and peace of mind.",2,Brian,2024-07-22
Poor communication I flew in from out of state didnâ€™t tell me they didnâ€™t have any power so I had to find somewhere to stay that charged me three times the amount that the place was worth,4,Chanthony,2024-07-18
"In addition to price gouging, the hotel's TV service was not working and I was not notified until I arrived for checkin. On top of that, I was given a form to sign saying that if I canceled my stay due to no TV service, i would be charged for the night anyway. I was charged almost double the usual price. I will be filling a complaint with the attorney General as well as leave a review on the hotel's website.  ",2,Kameshia,2024-07-17

"The front desk staff were very friendly. The room was very comfortable and clean. The breakfast was amazing. Our only issue was with the pool which was one of the main reasons we wanted to stay. It was very green so we didnâ€™t bother getting in. The hot tub was decent, but there was some white flakes of some sort floating around that a bit annoying. ",8,Dianna,2024-07-02

"The Staff is very friendly and helpful, Sam at the front desk helped me out when expedia locked up my reservation, and she gave me some waters to take up to my room. 

My room 328 - the shower drain is clogged up so you have to stand in water. The commode is not secure to the floor and the toilet seat is only being held on by 1 fastener and is very loose. 

for the higher price Hampton charges there are better options in the area.",6,BO,2023-10-18

"The breakfast time frame was until 10:00 am. Most places I have stayed ended at 9:00 am. Proximity to Minute Maid Stadium. Staff while they were very friendly, while checking in the person rattled off aspects of my stay in a perfunctory rapid fashion, where I had to stop and ask her to repeat or clarify what she was telling me. Overall very quiet and enjoyable stay.",8,kenneth,2023-07-14
