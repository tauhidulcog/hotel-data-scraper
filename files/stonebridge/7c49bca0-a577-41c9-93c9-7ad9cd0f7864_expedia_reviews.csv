We had a room with ocean view. Stayed here before and it was as wonderful as the last time.,10,Harold,2025-09-30
"The property is in poor condition. This may have been the worst hotel I’ve stayed at in terms of room quality and cleanliness. Upon arrival, I had to request a new room because both the sliding door and room door wouldn’t close properly. The bed sheets were dirty, and the shower had not been cleaned. While the front desk staff was very helpful in arranging a room change, the replacement room was not much better.",2,Toni,2025-09-29
Beach view was great.  Super location. It was very windy and wished would have been dividers between balconies to block the wind.  ,10,Terry,2025-09-29
"I loved having a peekaboo view to the water from my large balcony. Wonderful ocean sounds. The room was comfortable and quiet. Style/decor is a little bit dated, but it did not bother me at all. There was a refrigerator, a sink, a microwave and a coffee maker, which I would have utilized more if I had stayed longer. It was a very short walk to Oceans Calling and is in the middle of everything. Plus, I appreciate that they have a bar/restaurant within the inn that’s open late. I would return if given the opportunity.",10,VICTORIA,2025-09-27

"The location is perfect, right on the boardwalk and close to many attractions.  Love that they allow pets for a small fee.  Did not like that I had to pay for parking because I booked my reservation through Expedia and not the hotel itself.  ",6,Christina,2025-09-22
"Staff was great. Very helpful.
Great place to bring your dog.
Close to everything. The hotel was clean and beds comfy.
 It was a little dated, but who cares when you are ocean front.",8,Philip Lloyd,2025-09-18

This place was 1st class. Hopefully we can stay there for years to come. And the price was amazing. Only issue was paid parking. ,10,William,2025-09-16
Even though it was pet friendly there was hardly any area for the pets to do their business. Because we had a dog we were given a balcony that the dog could not look out to see the ocean. Very disappointing because we wanted an ocean front.,6,Brenda,2025-09-16
We had an oceanfront room and it was great. Nice view and spacious. My only complaint is all the balcony lights come on at dark and stay on all night making it awkward to sit out there after dark. I would definitely stay there again!,10,Kandi,2025-09-14

"Our 1st time at Paradise Plaza & we were pleasantly surprised. The oceanfront room was very spacious as was the bathroom. The view was amazing. The location was great.
There is a 10% discount at Sunsations if you present your room key.
Will definitely return. ",10,David,2025-09-09
"The staff was great. The room was clean and the view from the room was amazing. 
The drawbacks were trying to find parking in the main lot and our lock on the sliding glass door was broken. Overall great stay. ",8,Cynthia,2025-09-08
Ac very loud. Noisy. Barking pets. Uncomfortable bed and pillows,6,James,2025-09-07
A good location,8,brian,2025-09-07
I love this property. It is in a prime location on the boardwalk with oceanfront rooms. Pet friendly too. It’s not a dive like most spots on the boardwalk. My only complaints are there is no grass nearby for pets to relieve themselves. And my AC went out in my room and after multiple maintenance visits they finally switched my room which was super inconvenient but things happen. I asked a manager to contact me for maybe a refund for one night but never heard anything back (shocker). ,8,Amanda,2025-09-07

"Great place, clean & friendly and if you are looking for a pet friendly place this is it! Definitely will stay again. Super convenient to the boardwalk and beach as well as close to food places and shops. Only bad thing they charge you to park there which was unusual for me.",10,CARISA,2025-09-05
"Had third floor ocean view balcony.  Loved the view, and hotel location to the boardwalk.  The room door handle had issues, but would work after a few attempts.  We discovered that room service does not clean the room unless asked to.  No biggie as we were only there three days.  Overall we had a nice time there, and it seemed better maintained since our last stay there a couple of years ago.",8,John,2025-09-04
"I did not like area around the pool, very messy.  Also, the bathroom in the pool area had a trip hazard (extension cord), very unsafe.
The sliding door in our room was rough...it was a workout to close it, and when you did close it from the outside you had to be careful because your finger would get smashed in it.
Could not use the couch in the room, because when you sat on it you sank down so far it became uncomfortable.
Did like that the floor was tile and not carpet.",6,Wanda,2025-09-02
We enjoyed our stay at Paradise Hotel it was really convenient for myself and my family! We’ll rent it again :),10,Luis,2025-09-01
Staff was accommodating and we really enjoyed the room and view ,10,Derrick,2025-09-01
Will definitely stay here again. Rooms were spacious and nice. Everything was in walking distance. Parking was a bit tight at times so tried not to leave so that we didn’t lose our spot. Highly recommend this hotel. ,10,Tammy,2025-08-31
"We love this place for our OC Trips. Last year, we stayed somewhere else and immediately regretted not booking here. 

The staff is very friendly, and they create a great environment around the property. The balconies are a nice size to sit and hang out on. 

Parking is first come first serve, but it's a very walkable.",10,Morgan,2025-08-31

"My wife and I did a one night visit with our dog. Hotel was good, the staff was great. They got put us in a fine room with nice roof deck, and we were able to purchase a late check out. Worked out very well. We will be back for one of our many beach visits.",10,David Scott,2025-08-26

Very pet friendly property. ",10,Christopher,2025-08-25
"Very convenient location in OC, especially with a dog. With thrasher fries right below, 2 cheesesteak/fried anything boardwalk spots and a good live band bar that is pet friendly made it a good time. It was nice overlooking beach & boardwalk.

"Very nice room. Great view. My only complaint is that the sliding door to the deck would not open and close correctly. I spoke to the front deck. They said maintenance would take care of it, but it was never addressed.. Other than that our stay was very nice. ",8,Neil,2025-08-18

"We loved the location right on the boardwalk. Room was clean and plenty of space. The beds were not the most comfortable; a bit firm for our taste. The biggest issue that we had was with the shower. The shower was part of a hot tub setup and was very awkward to take a shower due to the placement of the showerhead. The design of the hot tub made it impossible to stand directly underneath the showerhead and the water pressure was not strong enough to angle it further out. Other than that,  we enjoyed our stay.

"Great experience, clean room, get the deluxe oceanview...you get 2 outdoor spaces with that. Daughter loved it! ..walking distance to beach. Right in the heart of the boardwalk and Ocean City attractions. There are eat places and candy kitchen right under hotel and a restaurant inside with live music. We Will be back! The staff was wonderful the young man that checked us in and always greeted us as we came in and down to lobby has excellent customer service skills. Great Beach Trip✅",10,Leighann,2025-08-10

I did not have a pleasurable experience here. Everything was disappointing and lackluster to say the least. I will not be staying at Paradise Plaza Inn again and neither should you.,4,Zach,2025-08-07
"Staff was super friendly. Very convenient stay on the boardwalk. Room was very generous both with space and the views; and quiet. However, it was still dirty, the soak tub had jets but none of the controls worked, and the pullout bed had no linens.",8,Shannon,2025-08-07

Great staff, great location, great view from ocean front balcony. 
The hotel is pet-friendly so be prepared to hear some barking during the night.
Could use some updates but was super clean!
Overall we had a great stay.",8,Brigitte,2025-08-04

"This was one of the better stays at Ocean City.  The hotel was convenient to areas that interested me.  Additionally, the room was clean, comfortable, and quiet.  There are so many hotels in Ocean City that do not seem to reflect any pride whatsoever.  This hotel was an exception.  This will now be my hotel of choice whenever I visit Ocean City.  I can't say enough good things about it: from the cleanliness, to the friendly employees, to the ease of parking, etc.  
",10,Steven,2025-08-01
Nice view of ocean.,8,Elizabeth,2025-08-01
"The room was somewhat clean. Two lights were broken.
They had an electrical switch plate in the mirror with no cover. The water when taking a shower didn't empty properly and you were standing in dirty water. We had to take the coffee maker into where our beds were and plug in in there because there was no outlet in the kitchen area. We told them what was happening nothing was done about it. For what me and my friend spent this should have never happened. I will not stay there again.

"I liked how spacious my hotel room was, i didn’t know it was 3 beds + two bathrooms. I didn’t like that the place was kinda old. We had trouble with opening the door and the TV disconnected. The place was fine but not worth the money. Hotel didn’t have breakfast, but you can easily bring ur own to make. We also had a dog, which was fine—no noise. Overall, it was alright but wouldn’t come again (considering the beach area).",6,Rosselin,2025-07-28

Thought it was great until my car got towed! An employee directed me to a secondary parking lot and when we went to leave yesterday our car wasn’t there. Cost me almost $400 to get it out! Completely ruined my vacation. ,2,Marisol,2025-07-14
"The property’s location is convenient, with easy access to the boardwalk. The bedroom was noticeably cleaner than it had been four or five years ago, and the area around the rooms was generally quiet aside from the hum of the air conditioning unit.

However, the AC ventilation was covered in dust, and the shower curtain and bathroom ceiling appeared to have gone untouched for years. Housekeeping didn’t service the room during our stay, and no bathroom essentials were replenished after check-in. Some staff interactions were disappointing — notably, two different employees knocked within five minutes between 11:05 and 11:10 a.m. to remind us to check out. After checking out at 11:15 a.m., I was informed I had only 30 minutes to move my car from the parking lot.The couching is dirty and has never been checked. ",6,Alemayehu,2025-07-13
Room was big and spacious with a balcony and roof deck.  Did not have a safety bar on sliding door and bathroom light and fan would not turn off.  Had a portable AC unit.  No chair or table in room and no pictures.  But still was pretty nice with great ocean views and was pet friendly but not a lot of places to take your dog to do its business.  The hotel and our room/floor was under some construction and renovations…and they did ask us for their patience and understanding while they complete it.  Staff was nice and friendly and helpful. ,8,Clarissa,2025-07-12

-parking on premises 
-bed was comfortable 
CONS:
-pool dirty af and small
-bathroom smells like mildew
-couch was dirty
-oceanfront was a view of the boardwalk bathrooms

I love the balcony, but I wish we could turn the light on and off on the balcony, it was bright all night long The maid service came way too early in the morning. They need to come later on that was a problem. Our door would not close or open without barging through it. They said they fixed it, but they didn't but these are the corks you're gonna have with a cheaper motel and you can't beat the price when you're on the boardwalk on the beach so you suck it up and you deal with it",8,Verified traveler,2025-06-26

Convenient to the board walk. Bus station in front of hotel. Paying to park and not being able to find a spot on site was a struggle ,8,Nicole,2025-06-17
We really liked the location. Right on the boardwalk is a major plus and the ocean front view was amazing. We stayed on the 7th floor and when you entered the room it had a musky odor to it at the entrance.The shower water was only lukewarm. The sink stopper didn't work. I will say that the staff was very courteous and friendly. Great people who work there. ,6,Ronald,2025-06-17
It was a good stay; I was a little disappointed in the kitchen ,8,James,2025-06-16
"Location is great and the room was spacious. Rooms and hotel need updating. Door to room was difficult to open, it took a few tries before we could get it open. The jacuzzi tub/ shower combo was odd. Not ideal for taking a shower. The water just ran down the ledge and onto the floor. Water pressure was low and hot water ran out during the weekend when it was busy. Beds were hard and not very comfortable. The cleaning staff did a great job each day cleaning the rooms and they smelled clean. Elevators worked on and off during our stay. There were times we had to take the steps and the stairwell smelled like urine. The main parking lot was always full, people were just waiting to get a space closer to the hotel. There is a small overflow parking lot across the street, but not ideal when unloading or loading. Staff was friendly. ",6,Melissa,2025-06-16
No hot water for bathing ceilings in the bath room was rusty.For this money it is definetly not worth it. The beds also had cheap hard mattresses. Manager was rude. ,4,Lisa,2025-06-16
"The hotel was great. Great location, room was amazing, maids actually did an amazing job of cleaning, but the beds were HORRIBLE. The beds were so bad that even my little children had a bad time sleeping and they can sleep anywhere. I’m so sad about these bed because besides that everything else was great but we can’t returned because we barely got any sleep and after being at the beach all day with children all you want is a good night of sleep.

"Pros: Good location, handicap, accessible, elevators, clean room with microwave and mini fridge. Off street parking.
 Cons: $16 daily parking fee, no private balcony, thin walls and ceilings, limited parking in lot.",6,Byron,2025-06-16

"No hot water. One of the elevators wasn’t working which led to 10-15 minute wait times for the one working elevator. Room was outdated and had bugs. When talking with hotel staff about a refund, the woman at the front desk was extremely rude and refused to answer basic questions and raised her voice at me in the crowded lobby. Terrible experience, do not recommend at all. ",2,Lauralee,2025-06-15
"The only positive to this review was the location being right on the boardwalk, otherwise I will NEVER stay here again. My husband and I have been coming to OCMD for over 10+ years, each year we try out a new hotel/ location, albeit always right on the boardwalk. I booked MONTHS in advance, only to be told the night I arrived ( after 10pm, mind you) they could not find our reservation in the system. We booked for four nights oceanfront.  Put us in a suite, and told to come back down the next morning around 8am when the manager arrives, fair! I'll take it, except room AC was barely working, ants all over the counter, sliding glass doors were covered in rust and stuck on the track. The hot/cold water on the shower were opposite and the hot water  non existent. Next morning, we arrive to speak to the manager, only to be told to come back three separate times before she arrived at 12pm. Told me it was not the hotels fault and that there was nothing they could do other then give us an extra night free. Absolutely disgusting place",2,Alyssa,2025-06-15

"The main plus is the excellent view of the ocean from this 8th floor oceanfront room.  The room was fairly large, and came equipped with microwave and minifridge.  On the downside, we had no hot water for two days, the staff showed no urgency in that regard, and they offered us no compensation for this large inconvenience.  Moreover, they added a $50 surcharge for parking, even though there was no mention of that when we made the reservation.  An when we tried to check in 3 hours early,   they wanted $50 for that as well, but we declined.  Maid service came only once during our 3 night stay.",6,Paul,2025-06-09

"Housekeeping, doesnt  come clean your room they come in throw some bags on the sink pull up the covers on your bed and some towels they throw on the bathroom sink then they leave. They came once never came again. They never cleaned my daughter and her friends room we had adjoining rooms Told the front desk about it. They said they would tell management  and have the manager talk to me and she never did.  I will say room was clean when I got there, but after that, nobody came and nobody cleaned it. I also had to go to the front desk and asked for toilet paper because housekeeping did not come in and refresh anything. I also had to ask for towels one day because they only came on one day and did what I wrote above almost $1300 for four nights and they couldn’t even clean the room if you have to stay there because you don’t wanna leave your pet home you’ll be fine but your room won’t be cleaned and you will have to go to the front desk and ask for what you need. I have never had this issue at any hotel on the boardwalk that I have stayed in. The housekeepers were right up to par with everything. I only chose this hotel this time because I did not have somebody to watch my Chihuahua this time.",4,Tara,2025-05-30

Could you please send a copy of my final bill today? They declined. Thank you. Marilyn Workinger ",6,Marilyn,2025-05-16
"Overall we had a great stay here. The rooms were nice. The view was great. It was right on the boardwalk so that was super convenient. There aren’t many pet friendly spots right on the boardwalk, so this was great. We did lose power one night in our room but they tried to fix it quickly. All the staff were super friendly except one younger woman at the front desk occasionally who literally never said a word to us or even looked at us for that matter. That was a little strange.

We ended up not staying in this hotel. Our room had a strong odor of marijuana. The door handle was very loose and the security latch was falling off. There were several round black marks on the bathroom mirror.also a lot of unlabeled doors along the hotel floor that were all cracked and not shut or secured. The hotel left me feeling uneasy and not safe. ,2,Benny,2025-04-20

"Place is a dirty nightmare, we were placed into 3 different rooms until we found a room that everything actually worked in. It was a 3hour process just to get our room. The place as a whole is very dirty. I talked to probably 10 other people who were also staying. 9/10 said they would never stay at the Paradise Plaza ever again. Although it is cheap, I’d spend the extra $100-200 next time to get a place you feel comfortable sleeping and showering in. ",2,Brady,2025-03-17
"We stayed for St. Patrick's day weekend and the room was clean but showed signs wear. For example- balcony door lock was busted and did not lock. TV was standing on the table yet the mount was installed on the wall. Sometimes there was no hot water. The door to our room was difficult to open maintenance guy came by and showed us how to open but was a mess. Why should I fight with door lock to get into my room?! We could not get connected to guest Wifi, it was not happening even after front desk lady tried to help us. Not helpful when you have a kid that likes to watch videos. Room was otherwise spacious and great oceanfront view. We brought our dog along and that was nice. Unless all the issues fixed, would NOT stay again.  ",6,Olena,2025-03-16

Do not stay here!! The tv doesn’t work… someone from the front desk came and still couldn’t fix it so she recommended we watch a podcast on our phones instead.  Then at 3 am went to use the bathroom and the toilet started overflowing so I called the front desk and was told maintenance isn’t in until 8 am and they had no plunger because it was locked in the maintenance closet ….. someone brought up a bunch of towels to lay on the bathroom floor… I am disgusted and will not be back here. ,2,Taylor,2025-03-16

"I hurt my foot due to the staff negligence. A large piece of iron was sticking from under the bed which they covered with the spead. The staff did not even offer for me to file an incident report. I had to ask and was told I had to wait for the manager, whom i waited for 30 minutes. My foot had a large gash and I was offered a bandaid, really!. I had to ask for my monies back. 

Anyway beside my injury caused by thier negligence, I very dissapointed with the cleanliness of the place. The roof in the passageway was leaking and a bucket was place in the middle of the hallway to catch the dripping water with no signs or guest apologies. Seems the dirt was swept to the corners. The pool was across the driveway and dirty things were stacked on one side. Disgusting for what could have been such a nice place. Dissapointed. ",2,kerryann,2025-01-16

"This hotel was such a nice place to stay years ago. Now it's just run down Ave in desperate need of an upgrade. It's dirty for starters, there was hair all over the bathroom door which also needed to be replaced because the bottom of it was peeling off. We were on the third floor which is apparently the laundry floor and all the laundry doors were opened to allow the staff to have air. It was not professional looking at all, give them AC or do something to accommodate your start, we were walking around laundry bins the whole time. To get into our room you had to use the key, turn the handle up then down then push and hope it opened...which we would not have figured out if one of the laundry staff hadn't been right outside our room when getting there. There is no phone in the room so you can't call directly to the front desk. I couldn't find the wifi password anywhere so I called down from my cell and no one answered so I had to go down in person and the guy at the reception was sitting there on his phone... Just not a great place to stay anymore, it's sad. I will say it was quiet and the bed was comfy. That's about it.

"Staff were very friendly, professional, and accommodating. Room was clean, however there was pooled water in the mini refrigerator and the balcony door lock was broken. Notified the desk attendant about the broken lock and they did immediately offer to send someone from maintenance to look at it. The location is ideal for easy beach access and the attached stores, restaurant, and nearby outdoor pool are so convenient. ",8,Susan,2024-07-18
"Overall my family & I had a good experience with our stay here. They gave the place a much needed facelift (paint job, new furniture). The staff was friendly & accommodating. The placement of this hotel is extremely convenient being that it’s right in the middle of the boardwalk. Some negatives, however, include the scarce parking options. Also, throughout our entire 4 day stay, there was absolutely no room service for us. We had to make our own beds, take out our own trash, and had to ask for a change of towels multiple times. ",6,Breanne,2024-07-18
"Wifi didnt reach third floor oceanfront rooms. Beds were clean but rooms were not clean, sand all over the bathroom, swept into corners. Pullout bed/couch had mismatching dirty cushions, and was very uncomfortable. Kitchen cabinets falling out, fridge wouldnt stay cold. Balcony door was barely hanging on..only thing good was the location. Bring your own towels-theyres are dirty and askibg for new ones, they were out..and pillows, theyres are old and heavily used. Likely wont return. ",6,Jennifer,2024-07-16

"This property is DISGUSTING!
DO NOT GO HERE!
First when we arrived for check in and the front desk clerk was rude. We went up to our room to find holes in the walls, the drop ceiling falling down, the balcony door broken without locks, which were rusted. A true health and safety hazard. The  doors on all the cabinets could not close. Everything was covered in dust, the toilet, tub and floors in the bathroom was disgusting, not cleaned. Looked like it was never cleaned after the last guests left. The sofa had stains. The phone was disgusting you couldn't use it to call the front desk. I went down to front desk, they switched us to another roon. A little better, but the sofa bed in the room was covered in pet hair and and the mattress had mould. We couldn’t use it. 
This place is not worth 1200.00 for a 2 night stay. They have no health and cleanliness standard.  I will be calling the BBU and the health department for a proper inspection.  
When I checked out, I was told ""that's what's expected in a pet friendly hotel"".

"First impression was good then everything went downhill. Air conditioning was out for 2 days. We let the front desk know about it and it took them 2 days to gives us another room but it didn’t matter because we were leaving the next day. The staff were dismissive and not attentive to people’s needs. The mini fridge was not cooling properly. The ice machine were all out of service except for one floor. The sliding doors were so hard to open and they didn’t have a lock on it. The fencing in the balcony was definitely not safe. Some of the poles were missing, some broken and dangling. Not safe for kids or even your pets. This is why we booked this hotel because it is pet friendly but that’s the only good thing about it. The whole hotel needs a good upgrade on everything!  Would we stay here again? That’s a very hard NO! ",4,Verified traveler,2024-06-27

"You will see people say they had a broken elevator, and you can’t shut the lights on the balcony off at night, and    It is noisy outside. WELL, let me put you to ease people, the employees are all super nice, the elevator is fixed now, and there are 2, you have curtains to black out light, and of course you’re gonna hear noise outside at any time no matter what, it’s not just a vacation hotspot, it’s a boardwalk and it’s summer! That being said, if you want more silence, I suggest a higher up floor. And if heaven forbid they lose an elevator again, it’s quite common in many hotels. The room was great, very clean and roomy; had some things that you could tell were old, Maybe even on their way out, but nothing that affected us, and those kinds of things needing upgrading probably make the hotel more affordable, so a plus in my column. Would definitely return!!! Thanks guys (shout out to George) 
 Off subject, there is a guy on the beach in front who rents chairs, umbrellas and tents. If you are 2 or 3 people and have a beach blanket, a tent for 30$ for the day is worth every penny! It is so peaceful, he will put it anywheres and you can get in and out of the elements at will. I almost fell asleep, and it holds up! ",10,Shannen,2024-06-20
"First, the staff, from the front desk to maintenance, were pleasant and accommodating. The staff responded to my needs promptly and engaged with me. My hotel room is the nicest I’ve seen since booking with Hotels.com.

"Where do I even begin..
This was supposed to be a nice relaxing friends weekend away for our best friends first heavenly birthday… this hotel experience was anything but relaxing. 

Night 1. We were locked out of our room for hours.  maintenance, front desk help.. even a random friend of the front desk worker tried multiple times/ways and was unable to get the door to open. We had to sit outside the room for hours until our neighbor got back to her room around 1am and we were able to climb the balcony and get into our room. 

Once back at the room, I sat down on the pull out couch only for the springs to rip out and I fell through resulting in me having to go to the doctors 2 days later for a sprained ankle (120lbs for reference)

The next morning when I was outside the room checking to see if our keys were working yet so we could actually leave the hotel to get breakfast I was chased down by a pit bill that was off leashed.  

And the general cleanliness was just lacking, I wore white socks the first night that I had to actually throw away because they were black from walking on the “clean” hotel floors. ",2,Kristina,2024-03-29
We had a great stay! We had to bring our very large dog which is usually denied at other places but this hotel welcomed him with no issues!  The staff was excellent.. very friendly!

If you can see past the rest, enjoy the views and keep it moving!",8,Heidi,2024-03-26
"Got what I wanted, a place to sleep where I could bring my dog. Was not looking for the bells and whistles. Room was clean and the shower worked just fine. I enjoyed the small living room area with the couch. Staff was very nice. Only issue was that one of the elevators was down, but I think that was more cause that one lead to the hotel bar that was closed for being off-season. Very cheap place and would return.

"I booked here for an overnight birthday bash at the ocean knowing that the boardwalk below would be calm and quiet. I had my winter coat with me, so I was able to sit on the balcony in the windy cold to gaze upon the choppy ocean waves until darkness descended. Although there were a couple signs of aging, the room was nice, and clean. More amenities than you normally find, such as an in-room safe, ironing board and hairdryer; and, as well, had a mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker in a little kitchenette area with sink, Standard bathroom, tub/shower. A long room. Along with 2 queen-sized beds, there was a couch (might have been a sofa-bed, I don't know), coffee table, desk/table with lamp and 2 chairs, TV/TV cabinet with drawers, a dresser, and nightstand between beds, with 2 lamps, a phone and alarm clock. Well-equipped with pretty-much all you need. It also has a very nice balcony with 2 chairs. But, in-season, if you're on a lower floor, the crowd noise will be very apparent; but you can hear the ocean very well, and in-season you'll be able to sleep with your door open to get that sensation, which is absolutely awesome; unless somebody on an upper balcony hops down onto yours and robs you while you're sleeping, then it won't be awesome. But, overall, I was impressed with the hotel, their front-desk personnel, and how well it's maintained. My only negative, is that there is no Bible from the Gideons. Boo, hiss.",10,David,2024-03-10

I have stayed at the Paradise Plaza several times because of its location and pet friendly policy. Some paint and updates would be great and make the hotel more modern.

"We stayed at Paradise Plaza Inn years ago, and were sorry to see how it has gone downhill.  We arrived early and while hopeful, didn't expect to get a room.  We were told that no rooms were available, but they would contact us when our room was available.  After an hour or so (with no word on the room) we stopped back in, and were given keys to our room.  Obviously it had been ready, but we were not contacted.  One of the two elevators were broken.  A leaking pipe was located in the hallway on our floor(5th) and had buckets under it to catch the water.  The elevator and leaky pipe were never addressed during our stay.  At one point someone reported a fire in the hotel.  The fire emergency lights did blink on and off, but there was no alarm to let people know of a possible fire.  Thankfully it turned out to be something of a minor consequence, and even though the fire company was on hand, we were allowed back into the hotel after about half an hour or so.  I love dogs, but know some people do not.  Apparently the hotel is very dog friendly, and there were dogs all over the place.  So, if you are allergic or afraid of dogs, I would recommend a different hotel.  There was trash located near the pool area and remained there for at least three days, and was falling out of the container onto the ground before being emptied.  The hotel is conveniently located to the boardwalk and many restaurants.  We did see some nicer hotels that we may stay at if we visit Ocean City again.",6,John,2023-09-08

Pool area very lacking and small. Great location and staff members obviously do everything they can to overcome the basically rundown, aging property. Room was at the higher price level so I expected at least normal amentities.",6,Cindy,2023-08-11

All in all wasn’t a bad hotel.  Very close to everything.  You could literally park your car and not need it again until checkout time.  Hotel could definitely use an update.  Elevator’s definitely a little sketch but I’m not a fan of elevator’s either.  As far as cleanliness it was cleaned upon arrival but then wasn’t cleaned the rest of the trip when we needed fresh towels would just call to front desk and they brought them right to us.  Staff was very friendly.  The pool was very small only went to 4ft and was on the parking lot side not oceanfront.  The lobby was very very small as well.,8,Jaunie,2023-08-09

Sand all over the floor. Sliding door didn’t close properly. Bathroom was gross. Shampoo and body wash were empty. 2 dogs and a parrot next door that didn’t stop barking/squawking. Limited parking. Had to park a block away most of the time. Balcony furniture cheap and filthy. Air conditioner obnoxiously loud. Only good thing was the view. Place is a rip off over the weekend. Put some damn money back into your hotel!,4,Scott,2023-07-31

Great location and beautiful view of ocean and bay. Good size room and wonderful staff. The building definitely in need of repairs and updates. Would be willing to pay more if updated to stay here again. ,6,Holly,2023-07-29
My husband and our four kids enjoyed staying here. The staff was very nice and welcoming. The room was clean and had lots of space. Plus it was right on the board walk and near everything. Our only issue was some of the rails on the balcony were a little loose which was worrisome since we have small children. Other than that we enjoyed our stay.,10,Chandria,2023-07-29

"The location was convenient! 

The staff was AMAZING. I did not encounter a single staff member who was not pleasant.

The building may need some work, but for the price paid I would not be expecting The Ritz.

Our room was a great size. There were 3 of us and we did not feel as we were on top of each other. It was quiet, I did not hear my neighbors on either side.

Our city view balcony had a view of the ocean, though there was no privacy.

The parking lot was full but there is an over flow parking lot a block down on the left. ",10,Jessica,2023-07-27

The images portrayed online are inaccurate. No privacy on balcony. A bright light on balcony at night that you cannot turn off. No toilet paper or towles. Sink was broken. Asked for help and didnt get any.,2,nina,2023-07-25
"The drop off and loading is a nightmare regarding parking. You leave and you may not have a space when you get back as the employees take up the parking lot as well instead of parking in the overflow letting the regular lot for paying customers.

The Wi-Fi is not that reliable. It shows connected but your device at times has no internet.

Two out of three showers , the hot water ran out.

Maid service occurred when we specifically asked them not to come in the room until we checked out.

There was sand in the foyer when we arrived, in our room.

The balcony door and frame were all but rusted out.

The staff however was friendly.",6,Verified traveler,2023-07-24
"Pros: 
1. Amazing location. This is the reason we selected to stay here. Right on the boardwalk and easy access to everything 
2. Room size is amazing. We stayed in a double with bay view. Room had two queens and a pull out sofa. In addition to that it also had a mini fridge, microwave and sink 

Cons:
1. Hotel is in a MAJOR need of an update.  Bathroom is small. Hairdryer was missing the back piece to it so when I went to dry my hair, it got sucked into the fan and got tangled. Took ages for me to get my hair out of it. Remember to bring your charging cord with plug as there is nowhere to plug in with only a USB cord. Outlets are hard to find as well. Beds had dust ruffle around the bottom that were not on correct and were halfway off laying on the floor. Our toilet paper holder was broken and the toilet paper kept falling off. We had to leave it on the sink, which then got wet from the sink water. When we got there our door would not lock. You could push it open from the outside. The maintenance man was very nice and promptly fixed the door so it would lock. The table and chairs (2) did not match and the couch was very old. 
2. Small parking lot for hotel. They did have a remote lot not too far with spaces but it was still would’ve been nice to be able to park in hotel lot


When we booked this hotel we were expecting what we got. Can’t beat the location or room size. It would be nice if the owner would renovate the hotel as the potential for this place is huge.

Two balconies

Cons- Tub never drained properly

Balcony door was dingy looking 

Parking was difficult at first when we arrived. We went around twice before my husband finally went into check in to ask about additional parking. Afterwards, it was a breeze since the lot was across the street.

"When making the reservations it showed that there was a Restaurant, when we checked in the restaurant closed in the fall. So right there that is false advertisement. The three days that we stayed there when waking up in the morning there was so much condensation on the floor that I slept a couple times, let the front desk know And they actually had the house key first clean it up which was nice but the following day more condensation, probably because of them turning the air down between 50 and 60°. And then, when we went to shower, you had to turn the lever to cold water to actually get hot water to come out of the showerhead. Next year we will be staying somewhere else.",4,Todd,2023-07-08

There was always someone at the desk and it made us feel safe. We could walk to everything It was beautiful. We will go again hopefully this year and I know it will be wonderful. 5 stars.,10,betty,2023-07-02
"The staff were all friendly and the rooms were clean. The pull out mattress on the sofa was paper thin and my son had to sleep on the couch instead of pulling it out.

"For starters maybe one employee spoke English,The Main parking lot was packed to capacity with vehicles blocking others in , the overflow lot was in a parking lot up the st with no lighting 
The facility itself was disgusting to say the least from the looks to the smell , the decor is as old as the property as well as the furnishings!
There was a leak in the ceiling on our floor they had a bucket on the floor  to catch the water and a sign apologizing.the beds were old and lumpy and pillows that looked like they belonged on a  toddler bed.The hot water worked a few minutes at a time if at all . There were 3 alarms to evacuate the property within two days for “faulty alarms “
The outside pool was more like a public restroom than a pool !
And to top the week off we found a cockroach on the hallway wall our last night there !! 
Truly horrific experience all the way around !!",2,Will,2023-07-01

Carlos was very understanding and assured me I would not be overcharged. The beds were clean and comfortable. The front desk and maintenance staff were very friendly. We had issues with the key cards right away, but it was fixed as soon as it was reported. The only real downside was that the lock on the balcony door was broken. If my children were younger, it would have been a major safety issue. Loved the location! We would definitely stay here again.",8,Jessica,2023-06-24

"After I booked a room that showed clearly room with outdoor deck when I arrived I saw room with no deck and my view was of a small pool & garbage dumpster the front desk apologized and said that that was the only room available for the night that the next morning they promised me a better room better view I said fine and after paying an additional $40 for my upgrade which I already have paid for so after arriving in my first room looks normal bedsheets look clean The nightstands are totally outdated and look horrible and you could see stains. The curtains to your room should be burned. rust everywhere. you basically have to unplug the lamps in order to get some sort of electricity to charge cell phones and stuff like that. shortage of outlets. The shower curtains outdated need to be changed don’t look good. but besides that, bring your own bedsheets so that you could feel comfortable and you good for the night.2nd room same as 1 room but with 1 bed less so a group of 6 we had to share 2 beds but the view made up for anything our room had a outdated Jacuzzi/shower with broken buttons at least i had cable ..the staff was wonderful front desk very sweet and all housekeeping 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ rooms need an upgrade rooms get 3 ⭐️⭐️⭐️ and that’s because the boardwalk view& ocean, sun, light view would I stay again?

If I looked closer at everything it looked dingy. They did not have extra bath towels when I asked so be aware they may not have extra ones. The water pressure on the shower head was also way too hard for my comfort. The balconies are also not partitioned off from one another so that’s something to keep in mind when booking.
