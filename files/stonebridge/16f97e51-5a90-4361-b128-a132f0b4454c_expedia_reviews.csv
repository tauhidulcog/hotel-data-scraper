"The rooms were exceptional. Clean, comfortable, and very nice. The buffet breakfast was perfect. No issues. My initial complaint was that the manager tried to charge me $12 to park my car, but when I booked with Hotels.com back in June, it was listed as FREE PARKING. Hyatt Place changed their policy in July. I had to phone Hotels.com to get the charge removed. My second complaint was the the top third of the TV screen was dark (burned out back light) and the hotel manager said it couldn't be repaired. Other than these two items, the hotel was perfect.",8,Donald,2025-09-28

"This a great hotel with one flaw:  the bathroom lights definitely need dimmer switches.  If you walk into the bathroom in the middle of the night and need some light, you will be lit up like a football stadium. ",10,Francisco,2025-09-22
"The room was clean and had a modern design. Continental breakfast had a lot of options. I was annoyed that they charged us 12$/night to park and didn’t tell us that they were going to charge us. The front desk attendant that checked us in just asked if we were going to be parking in “our lot” and gave us a tag with our check out date on it, but never said there was an additional charge for it, it just showed up on our bill",8,Andrew,2025-09-21

"We had a great stay overall. Our family trip was short, but the overall convience, the location, and great shopping and restraunts nearby. The convience to the city was nice being that we were in town for a concert! Overall, a great, clean, safe place to stay.

"Frist of all i'd like to say the lady over seeing the breakfast did an Excellent job. 
The hotel was very clean,  spacious rooms and comfortable beds.
My only complaint is the Bar/restaurant was closed sunday. When booking a hotel we look for one the offers dining & drinks. 
The guy working the desk (9/7@9) was leaning against the wall ""bars closed"".

Breakfast is served only until 9:00 during weekdays and 10 during weekends I believe. Which for us at times didn’t work (during weekdays) this was a con

"The room was ok. Hairs in the bedding and the restroom when we checked in. The worst part was the power outage, the fire alarm going off at around 2:45 amd waiting outside for almost an hr for the fire dept to clear before we could go back in. No acknowledgement of anything when I checked out. ",2,Darlistra,2025-07-30

The rooms were nice and clean, very spacious, and the floor we were at was quiet as well.  Would definitely book again if we ever visit Denver, CO again!",10,amy,2025-07-20

"Our room was not very clean. It looked clean when you walked in and that was fine, but when you looked at the walls in the bathroom, they were kind of a mess with splatters and gunk on them. There was tile busted off when we first entered, and the drywall around the tub had a lot of water damage. The fridge had the last guests food in it. There were chips on the floor under the TV area. And there was a dark hair in my bed. I got a room at the Hyatt because I thought it was a bit nicer of a place than a Sonesta or equivalent but I was surprised that it wasn't and I probably would have saved the money and stayed elsewhere for less and had the same experience. I was just expecting a better experience. The staff was wonderful though. ",6,Amber,2025-03-19

"I liked this hotel. There were a few things that prevented me from giving a 5-star review, but I will be back, and I will update my review if my experience changes. 

First, for the good: check-in was easy, staff was friendly/responsive, the room was quiet, there was plenty of free parking, breakfast and workout facilities were good for this level of hotel. 

For the not so good (none of these issues would keep me from coming back): only one of two elevators were working (for at least two days of my three-day stay), although I could control my TV with the remote, I could not turn it off or or with the remote, and the shades would not raise all the way up. 

Overall, a very positive experience. ",8,Francis,2025-03-05

Despite being close to bustling areas, Hyatt hotels manage to maintain a calm and quiet atmosphere, providing the perfect balance of accessibility and tranquility.

Unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked that night, so the staff couldn’t offer a different room. Despite this inconvenience, the staff remained very friendly and hospitable, which I appreciated.

Thankfully, the rest of my stay went smoothly. It would be a nice touch if the hotel could provide a locker in the room and offer at least a couple of complimentary water bottles.

"We stayed here on a trip to Denver because it was less expensive than being in the city. It took about 15-20 minutes to get downtown/to any attractions and 30-45 to get to the airport. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. The pool was very nice- perfect temperature and very clean. The breakfast was very mediocre- the hot dishes were not cooked well and they ran out frequently. There were lots of dining and shopping options near by, plus some tourist attractions.

"This is the second time I’ve booked a room with Hyatt Place Westminster. The service they provide is S-tier! Although there are other hotels in the area to choose from that I’m sure provide equal service, I’ve found everything and more I need in a hotel at this location. There are so many things this hotel does right and nothing that they need to improve on. I was greeted by staff or wished a swell day every time I arrived or left respectively. 

Room service wasn’t obtrusive in the slightest bit, yet still did a wonderful job tidying up my room when I would run my errands during the day. The same level of cleanliness and organization showed throughout the rest of the hotel. I was welcome to help myself to a top notch complimentary breakfast in the bar area every morning during my stay. 

The hotel is located in a very convenient part of town, with the interstate being located less than a mile away. When I visit Denver, this is the first hotel I look for and only hotel I stay at. Why look elsewhere when you have a good thing going? As far as I’m concerned, Hyatt Place Westminster is the best hotel in Denver and the surrounding area. ",10,La-Ron,2024-05-01

"All the staff was absolutely amazing and very friendly. They go over and beyond to make sure you have everything you need. They give great recommendations for things to do, see and places to eat. 

Particularly, Nova, the bartender - she is your A-Team and a valuable asset to keeping the bar and restaurant area running smoothly. During our visit, the storms that came through kept everyone from traveling elsewhere for food/drinks. The place was packed but she handled it with the utmost care, respect, and confidence. Nova was running around, making sure all guests were taken care of, and kept us all up to date regarding the kitchens abilities to keep up with a larger demand. She kept her cool and it really made it worth the wait. 

Ben, the night time front desk attendant was very pleasant to speak with and was quick to get anything we needed. Always greeted with a professional demeanor, welcoming smile and an eagerness to help with anything guests needed. He is quick to listen, understand and resolve all obstacles thrown his way. Ben is another great asset and managed his time very well. ",10,Greg,2024-04-28

"The hotel was clean and the rooms were fine.

I picked this location on our vacation because it was 30 minutes from Denver and an hour to the North and a hour to the South of the sites. Easy on and off the interstate with plenty of food locations near by.

Breakfast was an issue every day of our 5 day stay. The food came out warm not hot, coffee was never hot, and even the hot water for tea was warm.  I spoke with the manager on the first day but nothing changed, except for the staff. I never saw the same people in 5 days. ",8,Larry,2024-01-01

"Very clean and the staff was very professional and friendly. The continental breakfast was excellent, the coffee was very good. We stayed her because of recommendations from others and we were not disappointed. We will definitely be staying there again. The only two issues I had was the bathroom didn't have enough places to hang your cloths and towels. The other is the bathroom sink area didn't have a door to separate the bathroom from the main room. Addressing these two issues would greatly improve the functionality and privacy of the bathroom area. Overall a very nice and quiet stay was enjoy by myself and wife.",10,Alton,2023-12-22

This property is everything you hope for as a traveler, and more. However, the complimentary breakfast is mediocre at best, but about as good as any at other hotel properties.  The only disappointment, and was so surprising to me since the property takes care of all the other details,  is that there is no complimentary coffee offered in the lobby, VERY disappointing to a hotel otherwise such a wonderful property.  The in-room coffee is not good either. Otherwise, this is a top notch property,  and i will definitely stay here again if given the opportunity. ",10,Tim,2023-09-06

Also the chlorine was very strong in the pool, the kids did not swim for long as their eyes started to burn because of it.",8,Verified traveler,2023-08-14
I liked staying at Hyatt. I gave them 4 stars because their breakfast is the same every day. We stayed with them 4 days and we got tired to eating the same thing daily.  Not many options for vegetarians. Also breakfast is not kid friendly. Their cereal is plain or their yogurt is plain. So this is not a good option if you have younger kids. They don’t even keep yogurt  in prepackaged containers. They pour out the yogurt in a big bowel which is open to everyone. I will not be staying with Hyatt moving forward just because the breakfast is not kid friendly. ,8,Kamalpreet,2023-08-14

All of the gym equipment we used was in good working order. The pool was as advertised. We used the coin operated laundry (which was expensive), but served it’s purpose. The dining area was always lively. We didn’t try the food because the menu was limited, but there are so many places to eat around the hotel it wasn’t necessary. The bed was a little soft and the AC clicked on and off a lot. But we like a cold room and a stiffer bed. Overall, I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.

The room and location are absolutely perfect but the staff don’t seem to know what the “Do not disturb” sign at the door means. Four out of my five days stay I was woken up either by a knock on the door by the cleaning staff or a phone call to the room; I understand the policy about entering the room every 24 hours and we have absolutely no issues but why this can’t be done while the room is not occupied or even at a time that might indicate guests are no longer sleeping is beyond me. ,6,Ana Maria Ariza,2023-07-17

We reserved a room with two queen beds and a sofa pullout and paid for it. We got a King suite with a pullout which did not meet our needs for the extra bed to accommodate the 5 people we had. We were told at the front desk that the 2 queen bed suite should not even have been available on Expedia. So between Expedia and the hotel there was a mistake made. Love the property but very unhappy with lack of beds we didn’t receive after reserving.,2,shawn,2023-07-02
"The rooms were nice andclean; service was good, the only issue was when we checked in on day one. They told us they did not have a room for us after we have been driving all day due to maintenence issues. So they put us up at the Marriott  one.

Staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. Continental breakfast was included, but lacking. It would be nice to have real eggs Instead of powdered eggs, but again, it was free and included with stay. Waffles, fresh fruit, cereal, unseasoned potatoes, toast/bagels, yogurt and some sort of breakfast meat were the options. It was a lot of choices, just none of them that spectacular. The beds were comfortable, cable and tv included, though it was just the very basic channels. I would definitely stay here again, it was a lot more than I would expect for the price.

"We were very excited about staying at Hyatt Place. First impression was great. The cleaning service were very accomodating to our needs in our room. The reason for our rating is due to pets not on a leash, urine in the elavators, dogs barking in the hall and dogs being allowed in the eating area. We don't blame the dogs. The owners and hotel management need to take responsibilty and ownership. I have allergies pets cause them to flare up especially when they are everywhere! I also feel when I go to the Hyatt my needs should be met.

"My experience at this location Hyatt was extraordinary! I booked this hotel from 1700 miles away and based my choice off of other customer reviews. This hotel is located in a very nice part of the city and the interstate is directly up the street, which is extremely convenient if you plan on travelling from one side of town to the next. Hotel staff was friendly and greeted me each time I walked through the front doors throughout the day. My room was clean and room service touched up my room every day when I left to go explore the city. The next time I come to the Denver/Wesminster area and am in need of a hotel, I need look no further than this location.

Last but certainly not least.....the 6am-9am complimentary breakfast buffet is the cherry on top for this place. I am beyond satisfied as a patron.",10,La-Ron,2023-06-08

"Rooms were so nice and the staff was very nice and helpful! It’s in a good neighborhood close to shopping centers which is nice too. We stayed with 5 little ones all 6 and under, and had no issues. They loved the pool! No spa, but pool was clean and just warm enough! Our ONLY complaint, which is kind of a silly one, is that housekeeping came and replaced our towels but didn’t bother to do ANYTHING else in our rooms. Beds were a mess nothing had been wiped down… it was just odd they obviously came into our room and gave us fresh towels but did NOTHING else. But that wouldn’t stop me from staying there again. Everything else was great!",8,Nikki,2023-04-18

Was a great stay. Room was great! Breakfast was delicious! Front desk service was so friendly and helpful!,10,Verified traveler,2023-03-16
"They made me pay 25 to check in an hour early. The room was ready. I didn't pay any other time.  The showers are slick and I always find hair in the bathroom. 
The Staff is friendly and great area. ",8,Lynelle,2023-03-12
"This place is great! Updated, clean, friendly and safe. Nice to be close by downtown but not have to pay to park. 
The staff has happy to light the fire pit for us and the kids enjoyed the pool. Morning workouts were perfect in their larger than usual gym room.
One thing I would change…a night light for late night bathroom users. The glass frosted door lets tons of light out on sleepers.",10,joyann,2023-03-11

"Everything about our stay was excellent-- room, price, service, and ESPECIALLY the breakfast buffet.  This site affords ample space, many choices, especially of protein, and the ladies servicing the area were friendly and efficient in keeping everything stocked up and the seating area cleared.  And best of all, we didn't have to listen to FOX news!",10,Kenneth,2023-02-21
"Upon arrival, I was told our room had been given away since we were unable to arrive the night of our reservation. I did call the hotel to let them know we would be arriving the following morning and they said they made a note of it, but since our room (that we paid extra for) was given to someone else, I'm assuming they didn't make the note.
Once we got to our room, we were awoken by 3 loud banging knocks on our door. We opened it and nobody was there. This happened again a few hours later. We figured out it was a bunch of middle school/high school boys playing ""ding dong ditch"" along with RUNNING LOUDLY up and down the hallways. It was absolutely ridiculous how loud and rude they were being. The next morning, the team was in the lobby for breakfast and same thing...rude. If I were this team's coach or the parents of one of these boys, I would be extremely embarrassed. 
We did tell the front office staff, but not sure anything was actually done. Because of these 2 negative experiences, I doubt we ever stay at a Hyatt again.   ",4,Verified traveler,2023-02-21

"The hotel properties were really nice, clean and well taken care of. Great gym and swimming pool. Breakfast was warm and fresh. The lady/attender there was friendly and welcoming. However the rest of the staff I encountered were kinda cold. There was a couple staff I said hi to, they didn’t even answer/want to have any eye contact - weird. It was kinda a turn off but other than that, a good hotel to stay with your family/kids friendly.",8,Lia,2023-01-04
"Hoy pedí en la recepción 2 veces si me podían llevar toallas limpias, toilet paper y Kleenex y nada hasta la 1:00 am que volví a pedir, la basura y el reciclado la dejé en la puerta del cuarto y todo el día nadie la recogió. El huésped de al lado también dejó sus toallas sucias afuera de su cuarto y también todo el nadie las recogió y todo eso se mira muy mal ",6,Ma,2023-01-02
"A very, very nice facility for travelers suddenly snowed in during the fierce storm that disrupted, among other things, air travel. Nice gym and pool. Room  is very thoughtfully laid out and equipped. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND/",10,michael,2023-01-02
