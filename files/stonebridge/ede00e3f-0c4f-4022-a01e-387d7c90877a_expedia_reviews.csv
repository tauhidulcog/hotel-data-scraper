"Our stay at the Renaissance New York Harlem Hotel was  wonderful. The hotel is beautiful, comfortable and an inspiring reflection of the genius Harlem, New York through the ages. The staff was attentive, responsive, professional, well-informed and courteous throughout our stay. The restaurant staff was great, the menu was rich and diverse in it's culture and the food was delicious! we look forward to staying at the Renaissance New York Harlem Hotel next time we travel through the ""Big-Apple"".

I stayed two nights. One night and had an amazing time. The shower didn't drain that well but it was fine. The hot water was amazing. I stayed the second night and still had a great experience but I left with some bites that I still can't identify if were mosquitoes or bed bugs. I didn't see anything but I'm still a little weirded out from it.. ,8,Breon,2025-09-11

"Due to a glitch in the expedia system, I never saw my reservation. When I called hotels.com it wasn't reflected that I had a reservation. I thought I canceled it.  Thursday, August 28th, my credit card was charged. I called the hotel and they explained that since it was booked through a 3rd party, I needed to call the booking agent. After three separate calls of none sense, it was no help. To this day, I'm not able to see the reservation, but they didn't offer any help or assistance to find it! Will no longer use expedia!! I will use hotels.com only because they were so friendly, helpful and provided wonderful customer service!",6,DeBorah Crosby,2025-09-04

"The Rooms were NOT well cleaned at all 

They don‚Äôt sweep 

They make the beds (leave tissues and all behind) and mop the floor with strong bleach only ",6,KEHINDE T,2025-09-04
"This hotel was the worse! I definitely will not stay here again. My room was upgraded and I don‚Äôt know what the upgrade was. I guess it was the higher floor but that‚Äôs not an upgrade to me. Then, when I got to the room, the room smelled so bad! I called and they sent someone up to refresh the room. The hotel was sold out so I was stuck in this smelly room my entire stay. The refresh only worked for a few hours. 

Most of the staff definitely need a few classes in customer service. 

I will not return!",4,Cheryl,2025-09-03

"I complained about the stained floors. The manager told me ""we do not provide floors. We provide good bedding, hot showers. We organize events"" I told her that the room I was given did not match what they advertised. I would have never booked a room with stains all over the floor. Luckily, I made two separate reservations by mistake. The following day, I checked out. I was asked if I wanted to stay in the same room I said ""no"".  I told the staff about the situation that occurred the day before. They were very understanding and gave me a great room.
I do understand that the manager has no control over the flooring. However, she could have been more polite and understanding. Instead, she decided to lecture me and be rude as if I was an ignorant person. I paid to have a nice room without stained flooring that makes you want to rush out of the room as soon as you walked in.",4,Marie,2025-07-18

Next door to the iconic Apollo Theatre. Walking distance to two subway stations and Columbia.  No doorman service and limited taxi service (without calming). Lobby is on 5th floor. The hotel is newly refreshed and iconic/historic  feeling.  Neighborhood is mixed - some parts felt  dirty and at times a bit unsafe. ,8,Caroline,2025-07-13
"Dirty, dangerous, and a surly manager. Stay somewhere else, unless you like the smell of urine in the lobby, brown stains on your towels, and playing ""I wonder who's body hair this is?"" in your bed.",2,Daniel,2025-07-12
"From the very start, the customer service was on point. Check in was simple and the front desk receptionist was extremely welcoming and knowledgeable. Apart from the breakfast crew who seemed to get overwhelmed easily and ignored me for 10-15 minutes even though only two other people were at the bar, everyone was wonderful! The food and drinks were delightful. The rooms are adorable and they do a great job with the space they have. We would certainly stay here again!",10,Bryanna,2025-07-11
"We stayed 3 nights and reported on day 1 that the AC was not working and that there was no bottled water in the room. After 24 hrs, someone came to investigate but could not fix the AC. He said he needed a tool but did not have it. It was never fixed. To add insult to injury, we were billed for the missing water bottle.
The staff at the reception was uncomfortable when we reported our issues. They never followed up on our complaints and never resolved them.
The staff at the restaurant was rude and took 45 minutes to take our order, deliver and bill us for 2 cappuccinos.",2,Verified traveler,2025-07-11

"Harlem is a vibe! I lived in Harlem several years ago, so I was excited to see a new hotel right on 125th St. The building is beautifully designed and appointed. Staff amazing. The design honors artists of the Harlem Renaissance through artwork, music and interior choices. The poetry of Langston Hughes was etched on my mirror and stenciled on my ceiling. Additionally, guests received vouchers, to be used toward food or the bar. I stayed 2 nights and received 2 vouchers. I could see the Hudson river and Jersey from my 24th fl windows...and fireworks! I plan to book for Christmas.",10,Vicki L,2025-07-09

This hotel and its staff are exceptional and handle hustle and bustle very well. The restaurant staff could have been more helpful and inviting. The restaurant controls a majority of the common areas making it difficult to us when they close for sanitation and the evening. The rooms were roomy for NY standards.

"Booked 3 nights Renaissance hotel harlem checking in June 20 and out 23. The hotel bed sheets were so disgusting with blood like stains on both two beds. Requested for room change but the hotel refused. Have to check out after 1 night. Requested refund for the rest two nights we didn't stay but was rejected, saying it's hotel's policy. The refund policy should only stand if the hotel offer what paid for. Does that make sense?  Please be causious. See the pictures.

The property was so noisy. Even at check-in you couldn't hear. Why put guest check-in near the bar and the restaurant? We had a couple arguing from 11:30pm until 2:42am. Called down to front desk and nothing was done. ,2,antoinette,2025-06-23

"The room was well set up, given the smaller size.  It was very clean. We were given an upgrade to a city view once we registered as Bonvoy members. Be aware that some of the rooms don't actually have a separate, closed off toilet/shower. You can see that if you look closely at the photos on their site. We inquired about that and they gave us a room that did have a way to close off the toilet/shower. The staff were very polite and accommodating. The area around the hotel isn't all that great, but we didn't feel unsafe. We had to use our key in the elevator to get to our floor.  Our floor was very quiet.

Great stay at Renaissance New York Harlem Hotel.

Well i arrived around 12:30 and i was told that my room would be ready and it wasn't until after 2 pm. When we get inside the room there wasn't enough wash clothes or towels so i had to call the front desk for that. I paid for a city view and got a side view my room was in the corner.  I didn't like the design of the room it was to small and the bed is to low and the tub was too high to step in. ,6,Shana,2025-06-12

"I have to come up here for comedy and while I can say. I will definitely be staying back at this. Do need to change as far as on the amenities website. They said there was an outside. They said there was an outside area for like a patio. And there really wasn't one, but I think other than that. It's a beautiful hotel. The guy who checked me in was amazing! And the girl that night was ridiculously sweet heart and sleep and funny.  And the bar manager for the restaurant manager.He was amazing like it was nothing short of amazing.I just did not like the fact that when you wanted to go on the patio to have some new time to yourself.There was no patio to go till you have to go stand in front of the hotel otherwise at night.I'm staying here again for sure

We were on the 24th floor, and we could still hear everything as though it was in the hallway. Walking off of anything besides 1 25th St. was dangerous. Only way we would travel at night would be the other Uber or getting off at 125th st subway. Absolute worse location and staff not the friendliest. Though hotel was clean.

WHEN THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN I SEEN THE HARLEM RENASISSANCE IN MODERN DAY; WELL DRESSED, HIGH CLASS AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVIND A HIGH CLASS BRUNCH, DRESS SO VERY WELL, WITH THE MUSIC ON POINT. THE VIBE HITS ME LIKE A TON OF BRICK, BECAUSE THIS WAS ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND IVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. IT HAD A VERY OLD TIME BUT NEW TIME HARLEM RENASISSANCE MOMENT I HAD WISHED FOR. THE FRONT DESK WAS PLACED PREFECTLY NEXT TO THIS ENGAGMENT. THE ELEVATORS EACH HAVE A PROMINENT BLACK ENTERTAINER WITH A BIG PHOTO, I MADE SURE I TOOK EACH ELEVATOR TO SEE THE PICTURES. THE ROOM WAS AMAZINGLY MODERN AND GAVE OFF THE ROMANTIC VIBE WHICH MY LADY AND I REALLY ENJOYED. MY VIEW LOOKED DIRECT OVER THE STREET OF HARLEM AND I COULD JUST WATCH THE FEEL OF HARLEM AND IMAGINE HOW THE HARLEM RENASISSANCE WAS. I'M A TAILOR/ FASHION DESIGNER MOVING TO HARLEM SOON AND CANNOT WAIT TO MAKE MY MAKE IN THE NEW HARLEM RENASISSANCE, JUST LIKE THE GREATEST DID WHEN THEY ARRIVED TO THIS BEAUTIFUL HISTORIC BLACK AREA.

This location is centrally located, with convenient access to multiple subway lines. I will definitely put this hotel on my list of places to stay in the future. 

I have two friendly suggestions...
1) This hotel has three elevators. There is one elevator where the directory screen is out of order. The printed instructions are great as a temporary alternative to give patrons guidance on how to navigate between the different floors. You may want to prioritze this repair to avoid confusion. I experienced several fellow patrons who accidentally went up and down between various floors, especially those who were trying to get to the restaurant on the 5th floor. Many forget to give the card reader a 2nd tap after entering the desired floor, which leads to the merry-go-roundüòÇ. 
2) Please consider placing trash cans on each floor. ",10,Kito,2025-02-06

"While the check-in process was pleasant, there were several service challenges during our stay. We were not informed of the hotel‚Äôs cleaning policy at check-in, and only upon our third request for simple items like coffee and coffee cups were we told that standard cleaning is provided every third day unless requested otherwise. Despite this, the bed was made, and towels were replaced daily without our request, while other basic services‚Äîsuch as trash removal and coffee replenishment‚Äîwere inconsistent and required follow-up.

Additionally, during our second request for coffee cups, we were provided with clear plastic cups that melted when coffee was dispensed, making them unusable. Experiences like this, combined with the inconsistent communication around services, left us feeling frustrated and underserved.

We also noticed that interactions with staff were less attentive compared to what we observed with other guests. As two white gay men, this left us wondering whether implicit or explicit bias may have played a role in the level of service we received.

We understand the complexities of managing hotel operations, and we appreciate the efforts made to accommodate all guests.",6,Clinton,2025-01-17

"The stay was great.Me and my boyfriend wanted to come back before one incident happened, the red haired girl in the night was super rude. The minute when I reached to the Front desk she starts speaking unstopped and I told her that I have questions about billing and asked her to wait for me to show my bank account. She was interrupting my questions constantly. Like she want us to go on that second before asking anything. I explained to her that I‚Äôm clearly seeing two charges from the hotel one of them was $600 and the other one is $1080 in my reservation. Total balance should be only the $1080 even though I explained to her 5 times. She still told me that it was my first night on New Year‚Äôs Eve and she won‚Äôt even take a look. And rejected my request about getting a final receipt she has no idea showing me a statement or any kind of prove from my reservation. After all this she was like ohh give me one second you have two reservation. Yes if she stopped one second and listen to me she should‚Äôve understands it earlier. And she started to tell the $600 was incidentals. When I asked her that is the hotel holding $600 for incidentals she said yes to me. And than corrected herself that it was $150. Finally when her colleague came up and ask her if she needs help, she told me that $600 will drop off finally. She shouldn‚Äôt be working there. Her attitude and lack of knowledge is not a good fit to that hotel.",8,Ayb√ºke,2025-01-04

"Nice hotel and the wait staff both at the front desk and restaurant were great, however the customer service we received when trying to make sense of of surprise $200 charge was extremely rude. 
We travelled here with a budget and this after stay charge of destination fees compromised my wife's care needs and we were not made aware of this at check in. I have NEVER been to a hotel that says they are collecting full payment only to separate fees into before and after stay transactions.

Stay was good for a quick overnight family event.  Location was the best for what we needed.  Lobby and check-in area was a bit noisy with the live DJ.  Suggestion is to separate the two things.   The check-in area needs to be quiet. The live DJ and vibe was good but should not be so close to the business of checking in.  Restaurant staff were excellent and accommodating.

I walked to 141st. Seems to be the south west quarter of the building they show. They gave me 3 $25 coupons for their restaurant. Didnt use them. Totally modern. Way better than the other junk in NYC at this price. Great views. Big tv. Ignore the Target and Trader Joes and Whole Foods. Two blocks south is Lincoln Market. No lines and better selection and prices. Also find BTL two blocks north and west for wine. ",8,Nikolas,2024-11-29

"During my recent stay at the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised by the property's appealing ambiance and the warm demeanor of the staff. From the moment I arrived, the team displayed a genuine eagerness to assist, making me feel welcomed and valued as a guest. This positive experience, however, stood in stark contrast to the disappointments faced at the hotel‚Äôs restaurant.

On my first night, I opted to relax at the bar, only to find myself served a half-sized drink but charged the full price. This was a concerning start. The following day, I tried to enjoy dinner through room service, utilizing a $25 voucher provided by the hotel. Unfortunately, I was informed that I had to physically go down to the restaurant to redeem it. This stipulation was never disclosed to me when the vouchers were handed out, leading to significant frustration as it undermined the convenience that room service is meant to offer.

The situation escalated on Saturday night when I decided to dine in the restaurant and ordered additional chicken to take back to my room. After a relaxing shower, I was dismayed to discover that the chicken was burned. I promptly contacted the restaurant to express my concerns, only to be met with a curt response from the hostess, who insisted that I return the chicken for an exchange‚Äîa request that felt unreasonable, especially as it was the restaurant's error. I conveyed my dissatisfaction, mentioning that I would be leaving a review about my experience. Twenty minutes lat",6,Margaret,2024-10-31

"I needed a hotel room for about 4 days in New York because my oldest son was going to college, and also wanted my 9 year old son to go. I booked my stay at the Renaissance Harlem hotel and made my drive of about 12 hours. When we got there after 10:00pm, I attempted to check in and was told the room I booked was not available! They said the only thing they could do was offer me 2 separate rooms on different floors to accomodate after an hour of trying to get this fixed! This was HIGHLY inconvenient because I needed a room that could accomodate me and my 2 kids! I wound up having to take two rooms with one of them away from my son! 

The next morning, I stopped by the concierge to inquire about the proper room. She took my information and said she would call me as soon as the room became available. Nobody ever called me throughout the day and, when I came back that evening, I went back to the concierge to inquire. They did give me the room but nobody helped me move all my belongings! It wasnt even offered! At 5:00am, there was loud music and partying in the hallway that made it impossible to sleep! I called the front desk and asked if they could do anything about it. They said they would send someone right up to take care of it and they never did! The partying continued and me and my son were unable to sleep! It was terrible!
In the morning, the TV didn't work, the shower faucet was broken and I had to call the front desk again to fix it! I wound up leaving a day early!!",8,Tatyana,2024-09-13

"The room was immaculate, well designed and well lit. The view on the 22nd floor was spectacular. I had an issue with hotels.com and my KS room was booked as 2 QS beds. I spoke to the front desk supervisor Latasha who was polite, professional and more than helpful. She handled my issue quickly and helped make the night an evening to remember. I was born and raised in Harlem and I was delighted to see this level of comfort, service and ambience inside of Harlem; the hotel is right next to the Apollo in the center of it all on 125th street. 

I came at 4p and left at 6a for an early flight and was able to find street parking one block away.   There were some homeless outside on my walk to my car, but nothing that you would not see in any neighborhood in NYC today. 

We ate at the Victoria restaurant and  the food was excellent and the live jazz vocalist was amazing.   The only issue was that a mocktail I ordered took 30 minutes to get to my table, so the service was less than desirable for that once instance, but the staff from the hostess to the waitress to the busboys were attentive and friendly.",10,Onzelo,2024-09-12

Way better area to stay in, with lots of dining and shopping options.",6,Gergana,2024-07-06
"When I went to enquire about the hotel, the lobby itself blew me away. Then learning about the restaurant and the bar on site draws me in. 
After spending one night, there was live music with a lovely atmosphere. The Renaissance really lives up to it's name, if you know what I mean. 
I cannot complain, the front dest staffs are courteous, the waitresses, the cleansing staff, everybody were polite. 
I mostly like that only hotel guests/visitors with key have permission past the lobby.

I reserved four rooms, and could not check in 3 of them until 7pm after a long day of family travel..One morning, I left at 8am and returned at 5:30pm and  Housekeeping had not cleaned my room and attempted to clean at 6pm.

Staff is friendly  and helpful but hotel is ultimately poorly managed. We never got tea or soap refilled unless. We went downstairs to ask them. They gave us 3 towels for 4 people and 2 glasses only. No fridge available. New hotel but already very beaten. Cleanliness is well below average. Stains on the sheets and towels and on the bathroom curtains. Flooring is scratched and stained from multiple big leaks. ,6,Irina,2024-04-22

"Giving it an overall 4 stars, even a 4.5/5, only because our room didn‚Äôt have a refrigerator. Also, you have to pay for parking and breakfast, so keep that in mind. They did provide a ‚Äúcomplimentary‚Äù $25 voucher, for the entire family to share. However, you can only use it that night and one dish of 8 wings is $25 + $5 tax. Still, we enjoyed our visit.

However, bedside tables looked fine but actually when I wipe it off, the wipe is completely black.  Also I can tell that someone in the past has smoked weed in the room.  The biggest issue for me was the noise from the next room, I could hear the noise so much so that it woke me up several times during the night.

"The hotel was not clearly marked (no sign) and not found on GPS. It was a 20-40 minute Uber ride to the popular locations around Time Square. The service was mediocre, not overly friendly or helpful. No vending machine on our floor. Had difficulty reaching room service and unable to order. The hotel is clean and up to date, our double queen room was small. A curtain between sleep area and sink, then two sliding doors into the toilet/shower area. Not enough privacy in the bathroom. The surrounding location is dirty and filled with beggars. I was charged an additional 25$ plus taxes after my departure. It stated it was a destination fee, this was not explained to me. I felt that should have been reviewed at check in time. I felt Marriott hotels were better than that. ",6,Ashley,2023-12-20
"I, along with a colleague, booked through Hotels.com.  For some reason, I was assigned to the floor right above the bar and right across from the gym. My colleague was on the 19th floor.  Late at night, my partner and I could hear bass thumping from the music and weights dropping in the gym.  Certainly not the best of rooms or experience.

The vibe of the people were great (can't even describe). peaceful for resting day or night. My only BUT was there is no parking which is normal for NYC and no complimentary water in the rooms but, I‚Äôll highly recommend if you are looking for somewhere to stay and feel safe and classic.

"The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Great addition to the neighborhood of Harlem.  It's presence is just grand.  The check in lobby smells so new.  The restaurant is looks show stopping. We didn't get to eat there.  Seemed expensive. 
Our room seemed quite small for a family of 4.  We needed more space.  The room lacked a microwave and refrigerator.  As a result we didn't have anywhere but the desk to store food purchased. 
We had an overflow of garbage because the garbage baskets were way too small.  
We had an issue with the toilet.  It was leaking from the bottom and the toilet seat was out of place.  Engineers came to fix the problem.  
We had an issue with the television.  Wasn't loading .  Had to call to get it fixed.  They fixed some cables. and The television worked. 
The restroom and wash sink is too close to the beds.  There is a curtain to separate the space. You can hear what's going on in the restroom.  If you know what I mean. The wash sink is next to the restroom not in the restroom. 
The space seems all too cluttered.  We required more space for family of 4.
Security is an issue.  First floor should be aware of people walking in.  Anyone can walk in.  They don't ask why you are there.  
When my husband checked in.  He asked for an extra key. They gave it to him with no problem.  They didn't ask for identification. 
It took about a week for the charges of hotel stay to be removed from my checking account. You know how this can really screw up your accounting.

There was blood on the pillow when we got there, the tv audio and video were out of sync and the engineer said there's nothing he could do about it and blamed it on the rain. The service at the restaurant was awful. They took over 30 minutes to serve cold food with no syrup for the hard dry french toast and failed to mention that they had no steak and eggs after waiting 20 minutes for it. They served hot water that looked like it was the residue of a cleaned coffee machine. When asked if we enjoyed our meal, we said no and why we didn't, the waitress just turned and walked away.  After speaking with the manager, our meal was comped. That's the least they could do. Still waiting for an email reply from the AGM regarding our stay. Won't be back. ",4,cynthia,2023-09-26

"I did not have hot water for 2 nights.  When maintenance guy came to fix on the 2nd night, he said there is a bad valve and he doesn‚Äôt have a spare one‚Ä¶and he has to come back later to fix.  I couldn‚Äôt take shower before dinner that night.  When I complained, there was no apology‚Ä¶I was simply told the whole hotel is having hot water issues.  I also faced perceived prejudice.  On the first night, when I came inside after having eaten dinner with my daughter, I went towards the elevator door to take the elevator to the 18th floor.  The security guard loudly asked, from his desk, what I was doing.  I answered that I am going to the 18th floor.  The security guard, then, lifted his hand and used his pointer finger, for me to go to him‚Ä¶.as if I was a little kid or done something wrong.  I did go to him and he asked why I was going to 18th floor, and I said because my room is on that floor.  I did not appreciate the way the security guard used his finger to ask me to go to him.  I am sure he thought, due to my foreign looks, that I had no business being in that expensive hotel.  I was really insulted.  As soon as I got to my room, I called the management and complained.  There was no apology.  The manager simply said we will take care of it.  When I left NY and went home, I called Marriott and complained.  Marriott opened a ‚Äúcase‚Äù for me and gave me a ‚Äúcase‚Äù number and told me she will have the hotel call me.  I have not received a call back.
