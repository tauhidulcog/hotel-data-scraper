everything was wonderful!  One complaint would be the pool is stuffy hot and impossible to sit as a parent to watch kids.  Ventilation needed!  Otherwise wonderful stay. ,10,Lisa,2025-07-20

"Nice hotel, pool and hot tub were great, breakfast was great.  I saw a previous review about it being noisy and ignored it and boy were they correct.  Do NOT stay on the first floor.  Sounded like a trampoline park above us most of the night.  There was a consistent thud noise about every 20 seconds that never ended.  At about 6am the noise in the hallway was impossible to sleep thru.  As a single mom with limited income it was a huge disappointment to pay as much as I did and have such a terrible nights sleep.  Also the crack in the door was quite large and made me feel uneasy.",6,Kali,2025-05-31
"The walls, and doors are very thin.  I could hear everything in the rooms next to me, even the party, and brief argument in the hall one night.

One issue, I was in an accessible room.  I didn't need it but that is where I was put.  I noticed the bathroom door wouldn't stay open.  That would be a BIG problem for someone with a wheelchair. ",8,Paula,2025-05-30

"Everything was fine until we tried to sleep. Must be an older building because you could hear every toilet flush. 
We were on the first floor and from 6:00 AM till 7:30 there was a ridiculous amount of noise from people above us. Sounded like the were running ",10,Sharon,2025-03-02

"We were in Loveland for health care needs. Our home is 2 hours away and to avoid having to be up extremely early we came up the night before. 
We so appreciate the staff the one’s seen and unseen. We felt safe and a clean place is so important. Tell all your staff Thankyou ",10,Deborah,2024-12-31

"Staff were very rude upon checkin seemed as though I was bothering her. Very rude. Room was mildew ridden and bathroom was dirty. Very loud traveling sports team banging on doors late at night, yelling and screaming in the hallways no staff intervention to dispel noise. For $240 bucks a night I would’ve rather stayed in my car would’ve been more comfortable and quiet.",4,Richard,2024-07-09

"Stayed four days was unable to use pool and hot tub it was posted they were cleaning it it does not take four days , Air conditioning would work some times could not even run the fan. ",4,richard,2024-01-21
The carpet had stains and the bath vanity underneath was super dusty. Other than that it was fine. There was a parking fee which I felt is absolutely ridiculous when there’s a parking lot designated for the hotel. Not like it was shared with another business. ,8,Donna,2024-01-02

Great location to the Medical Center of the Rockies.,10,CRAIG,2023-12-13
"Parking lot was being repaired…noisy…could hear snoring  from next room, toilets were very loud. We could hear flushing and doors slamming.
There were little gnats around water sources, very tiny…but could see them on tiles in shower and they came from the sink. Hot tub was awesome, very warm, but getting into it was a bit difficult.",8,Karen,2023-11-19

"Average property showing signs of its age (stains on the carpet, food or something on the walls, etc.). The bathrooms are small - but clean.  Liked that they had full size shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and lotion bottles (mounted to walls).  Included breakfast was decent with options for vegetarians.  ",6,Sarah,2023-08-28
