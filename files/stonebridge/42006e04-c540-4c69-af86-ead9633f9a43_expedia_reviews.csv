"Hotel was nice, very clean.  We stayed 3 nights, and although we followed instructions to not have our towels washed daily for eco-friendly reasons, every day we got new towels.  Since we were following posted instructions to not have towels washed daily to save water,I found this very disappointing.",10,Vanessa,2025-09-25
Airport shuttle was great - we did not have to wait long for it to arrive.  Driver was friendly.  Room was nice - clean.  Front desk staff was friendly and helpful.  The food at both restaurants were good.,8,Elizabeth,2025-09-24
"The hotel overall was great. New, modern and clean. We had an accessible room, which was amazing for my spouse who is in a wheelchair. 

The area around the hotel isn’t the nicest. A lot of the properties are run down. 

The entrance into the hotel isn’t great. There is not a lot of space for a car to pull up for dropping off. Was challenging with getting a cart, loading luggage, and navigating someone in a wheelchair. If another car would have been parked at the entrance I’m not sure what we would have done.  The hotel also only has valet parking and it’s not part of the hotel. ",10,Ruth,2025-09-24

The guest next to me in room 335 were partying all night.   Multiple people going in and out of the room all night.  Music was blasting and they were talking and yelling loudly in the hallway and room.  I had to call the front desk at midnight to do something about it.   I didn’t expect this type of behavior at this type of establishment especially when I’m paying $400+ a night with no free amenities like parking and breakfast.   ,4,Chong,2025-09-14

"Very clean hotel with extremely helpful staff. Was about a 10-15 minute walk to Main Street, Flushing subway station where we got the subway 1 stop to Citi Field for baseball and was also about a 30 minute ride into Central Manhattan.

"An unexpected water outage occurred during first night, which forced us to take a shower in the other place. It was almost 100 degrees and super humid, but the front desk inclined not to show any chance of sympathy. They could suggest us the real condition when checking in us. But they didn’t say anything until we went downstairs and asked.

On the other hand, we didn’t expect the flights caused so much noises. 

However, the staff serves my last day eventually did something for us. Two breakfast coupons made us feel being valued as guests. 

Additionally, Expedia was trying to stand with us which I was super grateful for.",6,Feng,2025-08-02

The area looked a bit sketchy but the hotel was beautiful. We easily walked to the subway station and headed to the Mets game. Rooms were decent size and beds were super comfortable. First hotel I’ve ever been to that you can’t use the pool because there wasn’t a lifeguard. Every other hotel doesn’t have a lifeguard and we are responsible for ourselves so kids were disappointed with that. Valet parking was easy. No breakfast included. ,10,Heather,2025-07-23

"Great Stay Overall, But Shuttle Service Needs Improvement

I had a very pleasant stay at this hotel. The staff was friendly, check-in was quick and easy, and the overall atmosphere was welcoming. There’s a small convenience area in the lobby where you can purchase snacks or essentials, and the hotel also has a restaurant on-site. While we didn’t get a chance to try the food since we were only there for two days and in town for a party, the aroma coming from the restaurant was amazing. I’d definitely want to try it next time.

The hotel is located in a predominantly Asian neighborhood, so American food options are limited — but if you enjoy Asian culture, cuisine, and shopping, this area has a lot to offer. I personally enjoyed exploring the surroundings. Uber service was consistently quick, and the metro station is just a few blocks away, making it easy to get around.

The only real issue we had was with the complimentary airport shuttle. The hotel provides a phone number you’re supposed to call upon arrival. We did just that, but after waiting over 45 minutes, the shuttle never showed up. Meanwhile, shuttles from other nearby hotels were coming and going regularly. We eventually gave up and took an Uber to the hotel. Because of this experience, we didn’t use the shuttle to return to the airport—we were worried we’d miss our flight.

Aside from that hiccup, everything else was great. I’d still consider staying here again, especially to explore more of the local culture—",10,Betty,2025-05-26
"Located at 10 minute walking distance from the MTS Flushing station, the location is good. However, the preventive maintenance needs to be improved. Preventive maintenance was poor. The wash basin/sink in the bathroom was choked and the coffee machine had to be replaced. Texted request for shuttle service for pickup from the airport, but there was no response and the shuttle did not come.  ",6,Atul Kumar,2025-05-26

"Loved the location to the Aurther Ash Tennis Center for a College Graduation event—only 10 minutes at most by Uber.  The subway station was about 12-15 minutes away by walking, neither bad or great hike, but it did allow us to cheaply go to the City, but the ride can be about 45 minutes to Broadway/42nd street or Grand Central—not including walking to the station from the hotel.  I’d stay at this hotel again if the need for being in Flushing was required.  ",10,John,2025-05-20

Un grand merci à Eddy et Nikole, ils sont très professionnels 
et très humains n'hésitant pas à donner de leur temps pour s'occuper de nous en tout point. Ils sont l'image de l'hôtel. De très nombreux commerces et restaurants autour très pratique. Le menage et le linge est changé tous les jours. Le personnel de chambre très serviable, par contre il faut parler espagnol mais c'est très bien. Petit bémol, le petit déjeuner est servi à part par un autre prestataire et c'est pas très propre, et il manque à l'hôtel une terrasse extérieure, clin d'œil aux fumeurs, ils faut sortir dans la rue.

"Comfortable, large rooms.
However, the room I booked was not available so I was downgraded to a double room with smaller beds, I was not happy about this. I was then asked if I would like a late check out, I said I would.

In my room, the box of tissues was empty, I had a bad cold at the time so required tissues, toilet paper is far too rough to constantly blow your nose on. I requested some tissues from the reception desk 3 or 4 times and I did NOT receive any at all. 

Considering the staff seemed incapable of fulfilling a simple request, I asked to confirm whether the late check out was actually applied - it had not been so good job I checked. 

The stay was definitely disappointing, I didn't get the room I booked and staff seemed unable to complete basic requests.",8,Billy,2025-05-04
"Stayed with family for 12 nights and I enjoyed my time there. However, one of the front desk person ( I know his name but not going to write here) was terrible. He behaved as if we were unwanted guests at his house. He was terrible during my check in, and He even didn’t bother to look at me while I was checking out! Just took the room cards without any eye contact!!! Probably he didn’t like me and my family!!! I was allowed to use the pool from 10:00 am one day by taking undertaking that the life guard was not on duty but next day when I request that man to allow me and my children to use the pool at 10:00 am, he simply refused rudely. However, the other person at the reception allowed me taking my signature!!! On a tour you normally don’t stay at the hotel to use the pool from 3:00 pm!!!! However, the hotel was great, the room, gym, pool, laundry, pantry were amazing though the breakfast could have been better. The nearby food shops are a five to eight minute walk. I felt very much secure during my stay. They daily serviced the room nicely. ",8,A,2025-05-04

Only standing shower! When I checked out, I forgot to hang my coat in the closet! An hour later, when I went back to look for it! The front desk went up to the room with me! But my coat was not in the closet! There was a lady cleaning inside at the time! The front desk was not very proactive in helping me look for it! I think this needs to be improved!

Geo greeted us and kept us laughing the whole time as we were making jokes and enjoying our swim. Geo even was knowledgeable of the local area providing insight into some great dining options.

"I recently stayed at this hotel and overall I was happy with the cleanliness, the amenities along with the assistance I received since I was staying here for a little while after I had surgery but there were 2 major concerns that occurred during my stay. 1. My sister was charging her phone and suddenly, her charging cord along with the charging block were completely melted. We called the front desk to let them know what happened but all they did was offer to move us to another room even though our checkout was that day so it didn't make sense to do that. Then, I purchased something from a store around the corner to take back with me to Virginia and I left it in a bag beside my bed but when I came back, it was gone. I informed the front desk about that as well but they reached out to the cleaning service and they do not recall seeing it. So that means either it was stolen or mindlessly thrown away. I did not receive any compensation or even an offer for this inconvenience and since I had my surgery while I was there and bought those pre-procedure, it was impossible for me to go out and buy another one. I wish they would have offered something since both incidences ended up with us losing items.",6,Brya,2025-04-23

"I just stayed here for 6 nights, the hotel itself is nice, staff was friendly however my room was left open 2 times after house cleaning thank god nothing stolen. My reason for not giving a 5 star rating is the parking garage. Night 1 my rental came out with a big bumper dent and hotel was quick to brush me off with the parking garage is separate. I submitted a claim and was told pretty much Im on my own while they investigate which will take weeks. I ended up having to get it fixed so I wouldnt be screwed at rental place. Also parking is not $35 as noted on property details its $42 for suv. ",6,Linda,2025-04-10

"I usually love this place until I went down for breakfast. The guy in the restaurant stuffing his face with breakfast tells me “there’s no breakfast today”. Looks like the food was cooked inside because it was prepared on a glass plate. Not sure, but I went to the lobby and they confirmed no breakfast. Cool, but at least have “to go” sealed breakfast for backup. Each restaurant around there is a 20-minute walk round trip, and it happened to be very cold that day. Nice hotel, but definitely need to accommodate breakfast for guests ",6,victoria,2025-04-09

"The reviews on Expedia for the hotel were not at all my experience here. I was really unimpressed with the four points Sheraton. They didn’t reply to messages on Expedia, the shuttle took half an hour to arrive and when I tried to call the front desk to find out when it was coming it took like 10 minutes of trying for someone to answer the phone. The room was dank and had a very very strong smell of cleaning products on arrival (it seemed clean at least) but very unpleasant to sleep in. The worst was that there were very loud guests in the hallway at 4 am banging doors and talking loudly and there seemed to be no soundproofing in the room. I was just there for one short night so I did not bother to complain in person but I will not be back.",2,Jeremy,2025-04-04

We have dinner there and the staff forgot to give my credit card back. The following day we went shopping and that's when I found out that I dont have my card with. After 20hrs I was able to get my credit card back but I have to apply for a new card coz I saw where they kept my card and it was fully exposed. Worried about my information being stolen so I decided to cancel that card and apply for a new card. 
And we also noticed that the hotel allowed people that are not guests of that hotel to come and do pictorials in the lobby and in the stairs.

During my stay, I was particularly impressed by the exceptional service provided by the staff, especially Raekwon and Daquan. Their warm and welcoming demeanor made a significant difference, as they went above and beyond to ensure that all my needs were met. The hotel itself provides a cozy atmosphere, with well-appointed rooms and amenities that enhance the overall experience. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a pleasant getaway.",10,Billie,2025-02-07

On the last night I was able to enjoy the amenities of the hotel, as far as the gym, and pool. Downstairs in the basement you’ll find a nice comfort area, laundry, fitness, and pool. It’s a nice area to relax outside of the room. When I first arrived I was early, and had no problem checking in early. I also went inside the original room they gave me, although I asked for a different one. I was able to be switched to an even better room with no problem. Such an amazing stay, I would definitely recommend. I would also stay at this location again if near the area. Every staff was super nice and helpful. Thank you! ",10,Juwell,2025-01-21

The great experience in New York stopped right there. I have never seen this kind of rude hotel staff in my whole life. Why Sheraton still keeps him in such an important position? And when we waiting for the elevator, another couple comes in and did the same thing. That staff said exactly same stuff to them with a horrible attitude. If Sheraton doesn’t serve a bottle of a water, please say in a polite way. ",6,Yu,2024-12-28

Had a great experience at the hotel. Rooms were spacious and clean. Room and hotel were also very modern looking. Staff was amazing. Always there to help and always stocked with extra items you dont realize you need till last minute. We had a toddler and needed a microwave in our room and they had one put in our room as well. Location was convenient and around a 10 min walk to the subway. Area was safe too even at nighttime. Great if you want a nice hotel in nyc without shelling out for a hotel in manattan. ,10,Aaisha,2024-12-28
Just need pillows with more inside they were so flat even using two.

First and foremost o was right next to the best food in NYC..namely the real Chinatown was a short walk from the hotel.  Amazing food and atmosphere.  Secondly the hotel was clean and more importantly for me the bed was comfortable.  Thirdly Uber was easy and transport to Manhattan was simple. Even though i dont pay for it i guarantee u that this hotel was a lot more affordable than in Manhattan.  It also had a pool and breakfast at the hotel.  Try finding that in Manhattan for less the $500.  Anyway...staff was great.",10,clement,2024-12-14

"The tv barely worked so we couldn’t use it the entire stay there. Couldn’t even connect hdmi wiring to play my game console, tv remote was slow and stopped working after a while. Large spacious outdoor areas around the entire hotel and it said only employees were allowed which wasn't fair because when I booked the hotel, it showed outdoor terrace area like if we were welcomed there. Only one working elevator, very crowded when entering and leaving, had to come out the pool soaked and wait in cold lobby after being in the cold pool that claimed to be heated. plllows were so flimsy like not stuffed at all, ",4,Leslie,2024-11-03

Funcionários extremamente rudes no check in, sem paciência nem para escutar uma pergunta sem interromper. Não faz jus ao nome e qualidade  da rede Four Seasons by Sheraton. Paredes finas entre os quartos, hóspedes barulhentos (não é culpa do hotel mas eles tampouco se importam com isso), festa no subsolo onde havia convidados bêbados vomitando no saguão (também não é culpa do hotel o convidado mas também não se importaram ao ver o que era a óbvio que ia acontecer)!

It was a sliding door with large gaps between the wall and door. In which you can see EVERYTHING through. On top of that, there were no locks on the “door” too. I really hated the bathroom situation. No privacy whatsoever, there might as well not be a door there. My sisters and I are very close, but we didn’t feel comfortable using the bathroom in our room.

"My son and I traveled to see a concert at Citi Field. The hotel was about a 15 minute walk from the train station. Check in was super quick and easy and we were able to check in a smidge early, which was very appreciated The staff were kind, welcoming, and attentive. While not the biggest, our room was very clean and contained all amenities listed in the description. The two complimentary bottles of water awaiting us was a fantastic welcome after a long day of travel. The beds were very comfortable with enough pillows to keep comfortable throughout the night. 
My one warning…if you’re in town for an event at Citi Field, it is a much longer walk than any of the descriptions/reviews made it seem. It’s a solid 35-40 minutes at a swift pace. Additionally, the neighborhood is almost empty with minimal street lights after like 11pm. We didn’t feel unsafe, but just something to keep in mind. 

If I plan to attend another event at Citi Field I will absolutely stay here again! ",10,Luke,2024-09-09

Hotel was cleaning.  I was charged over 400 as a deposit two days in advance of my stay. They never told me in advance why. When I asked about they said it was a deposit in case the hotel sold out. I got my final bill and the deposit was applied to the bill so they charged me full price plus the 400 deposit.  They also had no clocks near the beds or a safe to store valuables. The prices were really expensive compared to Manhattan but I assume it’s because the U.S. open is currently taking place. It took over an hour to get my food at the hotel restaurant downstairs and I know other customers didn’t even get their food.  The hotel rooms were cleaned which is good. In Vegas at the Venetian you get much larger rooms with full amenities at half the price.  This hotel does not have room service. I wouldn’t stay here again,6,Verified traveler,2024-08-31

"We stayed at this hotel one night as part of a family NY trip thanks to a nearby craft shop my teen wanted to visit. The hotel was modern, clean and easy to find. Valet parking on-site was convenient. 

The area was a pleasant surprise as it was populated with many Asian restaurants, shops and residents. I felt safe as a woman walking a few blocks from the craft shop to a restaurant and back to the hotel at night. There were plenty of people out and many of them were women on their own and families with kids. 

To get to the hotel, you might be routed through an industrial block or two but the other side of the hotel is all shops, restaurants and residential spaces. 

We slept in too late to catch breakfast but treated ourselves to a local French-inspired bakery that was incredible. 

Flushing is a wonderful place and we look forward to staying at the Four Points by Sheraton Flushing again. ",10,Krista,2024-07-31

My stay was amazing!! We came in town for a wedding and my friends were able to stay with me for a night because their hotel was too far. The Sheraton was ten minutes from the venue and had everything we needed to get ready for the wedding and come home conveniently afterwards. Every person I interacted with at the hotel has been so sweet (rare for a NYC hotel) - from the front desk members to the housekeeping staff. I had a few meetings that I had to take after I checked out and was able to find a quiet place to work downstairs. One of the management team members even came down and gave me a water bottle and snacks. I love being able to stay so close to the airport  at an affordable rate and a very clean and comfortable stay. I can unpack my stuff and get into the city without paying insane uber/taxi fares.

Flushing Main street has a large Chinese community and so can find a lot of Chinese restaurants and shops. We stayed here for 2 nights as got early flight at nearby airport (LaGuardia) and hotel has complimentary airport shuttle to this airport every 30 minutes to every hour depending on the time of day. So it is extremely convenient for us. ,8,Stephen,2024-07-22

Hotel is clean and safe and looked like the nicest option within walking distance for us. We weee happy with amenities and the staff was really accommodating. 

I looked at reviews for boutique hotels in the area and read about a lot of security and cleanliness concerns. I had none of that here.
 
Would definitely recommend.",10,Roxanne,2024-07-21

"I will not return to this property due to inadequate communication and customer service. My flight arrived late. I got to the hotel at 8:45pm for check-in, but I was unable to access my room until 10:20 pm because the front desk failed to mention the $150 deposit required for check-in. They proceeded to charge the deposit in $50 increments, causing issues with my bank account and resulting in a 30-minute wait on the phone to resolve a missing $50 transaction. After a long flight and feeling tired being pregnant, a smooth check-in process is all you want. Why couldn't they allow a $100 hold for check-in instead of splitting it into 3 separate transactions?",2,Shernelle,2024-07-10

Also, just a suggestion I wish the restaurant downstairs and their servers would communicate better with gas for instance  letting No, it was last call only to go up to the bar to discover that the bar was closed.

"We were unfortunately in Queens because of a funeral but our stay made a not great situation much easier! Both Dequan on night staff and Jessica on day staff were helpful, friendly, and efficient. Thank you both!
The rooms have high ceilings which made them feel bigger and spacious. Our King room was plenty big for two without feeling like we were on top of each other. It was also quite clean!",10,Robyn,2024-04-21

"It was a great location for La Guardia airport and so many Asian food options too. Staff were helpful and attentive, and free the airport shuttle was a bonus! The pool was clean and warm. The only thing that could have improved our stay was the pool opening hours: it only opens at 3:00pm on weekdays. With two small kids, it would have been great to swim before our flight that morning.",10,Sarah,2024-04-04
"Great hotel, idk what people complain about, what do they expect? Sometimes reading these reviews, it seems it's a bunch of Winsors' relatives... Anyway, loved my 1 night stay here, the room was perfect, the livery is great, super confortable mattress, quiet room. The shuttle to Laguardia is super convenient, on time. Love that there are many open late restaurants nearby (10 min walk) in Flushing, very convenient after a very long flight. Helpful staff, nice lobby where it's actually confortable to spend some time in. ",10,Ky Nam,2024-04-03

"We stayed in Four Point hotel for Friday night. Overall enjoyed our stay.  The full size bed seems bit small, wish the hotel offers queen size bed, so it can be more comfortable when the bed is shared among 2 people.   Also enjoyed the bag storage service which very helpful while we cannot carry our bags to do more shopping the next day.

The only one thing I think it can be improved is the valet parking to have more personnel to help the valet parking process.
Understand the parking is not operated by the hotel, so I put my comments here (in case it helps). 

We arrived around 9:30PM on Friday night, and need to wait for a very long time for the staff to check in our car while the staff (seems only one staff working during that time) was helping other customer to locate his/her vehicle.  ",8,Xiao,2024-04-01
"We had a truly great stay. The staff was superb. Special shout out to Jessica, Daquan, Christine & Brian's. These Guys were so accommodating and ready to assist in any way they could. Definitely a 5 Star service.

The lobby is large with tables, chairs and sofas you can sit in after check out.  You can sit there with friends and eat.  Overall the only thing the restaurant in the basement lunch $17.00 when paid cash.  If you pay when booking the hotel I was told it is cheaper.  Hotel is 15 mins from LaGuardia airport and 10 mins walk to nice restaurants ",10,marion,2024-03-17

Only issue was that the outlets in the bathroom were blocked off so I wasnt able to curl my hair in front of a mirror for the event we attended and since we were late I didnt have time to complain to guest services. I also appreciated the fact that they had valet, definitely a hugeeee plus! ",8,Lulu,2024-03-15

I don't understand why this hotel has such a high rating. The hotel is very small and not enough to accommodate our two large suitcases.

The area surrounding this hotel is questionable at best. Inside the hotel is fine but I wouldn’t be walking around at night. The interactions with staff were transactional and cold. There was definitely no going above and beyond. The front desk person wouldn’t even look up my Bonvoy number to apply nights to my account so now I need to call customer service separately to do this.  Looking to check in an hour or two early?  That will cost you $60 per room (ridiculous!). $150 extra to bring the dog. Know that there’s not a patch of grass super close to the hotel for dogs to relieve themselves. The hotel room itself was clean and what one should expect at a Sheraton. ,6,Lisa,2023-12-03

Got to our room and… Wow! Modern, spacious, clean and lots of sunshine! Linens were fresh and giant TV was a plus. 

On site parking was an extra $30 USD but using Spot Hero, the exact same valet parking was $17 USD.

"We really enjoyed our stay.  Keith held our bags because we arrived super early before check-in. We were starving and really wanted some great food. He made a recommendation and it did not disappoint. It was actually on the list of top dumpling restaurants in Flushing.  After lunch and some walking around, we arrived back (still a little early) and our room was ready.  Very clean.  The only reason I would rate the area around the hotel as average is because the dining options were strictly Asian (Great for US!!) perhaps not so much for individuals who only know crap American fast food. If you do not have the stomach for a cultural experience (which is what you should have when you stay here)...then don't complain. We loved it. ",10,Patricia,2023-11-07

"I’ll say on Expedia it needs to update the specific airport shuttle. It came off misleading to those arriving at JFK. Also Expedia has Times Square as 19 minutes away, and it was 40min. I would notate the beds are small the King only fits two, and your pretty close, had to upgrade room. ",6,Nichelle,2023-11-03
"Normally I do not care to write a review, but this particular hotel I definitely will. The person who was checking us in was completely rude and was judging my family. I was completely disturb that I ended up walking away from the situation. Not only just that our room was cleaned but when I removed the sheets it was completely dirty. I was supposed to get the upper level, but he moved me to lower level for some odd reason. I would highly recommend to ask about fees because they will charge for anything that’s being used in the room, also, it’s pet friendly but it’s a charge as well. They finally listed on the website after I made a complaint, the hotel hasn’t taken any responsibility regarding about the complaint I made. Also, Expedia should be held responsible because it’s a third party booking which didn’t make sense to me at all. Can’t say much on the review because Expedia; choosing not to allow my comment to be posted. ",2,Michelle,2023-11-02

"Leider gab es Probleme mit dem Flughafentransfer, nach über einer Stunde Wartezeit am Airport habe ich in Absprache mit dem Hotel ein Taxi genommen. Bei Ankunft hat man sich mehrfach aufrichtig entschuldigt und mir ein paar „Goodies“ angeboten. Freundlichkeit des Personals insgesamt war prima. Ausstattung und Zustand des Hotels ist neu- und hochwertig. Das man ein Fenster im Zimmer teilweise öffnen kann war klasse. Ein Restaurant im Keller, bietet auch ein Frühstück für ca. 19,-$. Die Auswahl beim Frühstück war allerdings begrenzt und die warmen Speisen kalt. 
Die Lobby des Hotels ist übersichtlich, hatte mir für die Kategorie mehr erwartet. 

Der Ortsteil Flushing besteht zu einem Großteil aus einen asiatischen Viertel. Die nahegelegenen Hauptstraße ist sehr wuselig und bietet keine Besonderheiten. Die Subway erreicht man zu Fuß in ca. 10 Minuten. Die Fahrt bis Manhatten ca. 45 Minuten. An der Nordspitze des Ortsteils (ca. 20 Minuten mit dem Bus, Haltstelle Näge Hotel) gibt es einen kleinen Park, von dem man eine guten Blick auf Manhatten und den nahegelegenen Airport LaGuardian hat.

"Great property,  spacious room, excellent bathroom and shower, openable window and fridge. 

Two things could be improved. 

1. The breakfast offer is poor but i understand that it is provided by an independent contractor. If you are a non meat eater, there is almost nothing for you. They didn't have milk or butter and this was over multiple days. Very poor offer. There places near by to eat and a grocery store call Stop n Shop within walking distance. Best to stock up and avoid the restaurant. Rooms have a mini fridge for storage and Reception has a microwave. 

2. I was irritated by having to hold $150 against my card on check in. This is totally pointless and was not pre notified. ",10,sylvester,2023-10-21

The bed was comfortable. But I had to wear earplugs to sleep. The shuttle to LaGuardia is convenient, which is why we chose this hotel.",6,William,2023-05-05
The staff and overall stay was excellent!,10,michael,2023-05-03
"The property was great, it was clean, quiet and reasonably priced. My only complaint is the shuttle service. Upon arrival it is quite confusing as it says ""scheduled."" It was interpreted by my travelling party that it likely arrived every 1/2 hour or so. It turns out that you must call the hotel to receive the text line to let them know you have arrived. We did that after waiting a bit, and there was some confusion with it's arrival. The shuttle bus is poorly marked, possibly causing us to miss it. The shuttle said ""Hampton Inn"" on the front and only had 2 printed signs to indicate it was actually this hotel (one of which is posted behind highly tinted windows). Expedia was no help in trying to figure out the shuttle scenario. 

The shuttle back to the airport was also a bit confusing. They framed it as it leaves with your booking (they take the name and room number), however, due to my own fault we were a few moments late. The shuttle left, which is completely reasonable. I just wish they would have communicated that it does not wait for the person who booked it, rather it leaves every 1/2 hour (making the booking redundant). 

When booking it, we originally thought that 40-60 minutes on the subway into NYC would not be so bad. For anyone thinking this, I would advise against it and say that you should likely stay closer. Although the hotel is clean, safe and quiet, the trek into NYC was a bit cumbersome and did not allow for mid-day rest. Subway was easy to navigate though.",8,Chelsea,2023-05-03

"This hotel stay was very nice but of course I needed to deduct 1 star mostly for things the staff cannot control. For instance, front desk is very very busy from checking people in and out to organizing events being hosted a the hotel. It was a very lengthy process to check in and out but everyone is really helpful when it's your turn. I thought other comments were just exaggerating about the thin walls but I surprisingly agree. Our single king room had one of those doors that shared with the next room (locked of course) but I wanted to cry when I could hear this neighbors alarm every morning at 630 am as if it was in the same room. Not to mention we could hear them brushing their teeth and essentially getting ready every morning as if it was one of us. Outside of that though there were good points. Room was very very clean, area seemed safe enough to walk which we did to get to the subway, and it was easy to get lyft rides when needed. Bonus was there is a shuttle to the airport which was very nice too. ",8,Kayla,2023-04-16

"I am not normally a person who makes complaints, but I have had a genuinely terrible experience with this hotel in the last couple weeks. I booked a room with Expedia, and everything went well until I arrived back home. Despite my average stay (not drinking the water bottles or ordering any room service or anything) i had been charged an extra amount of over 100 dollars :( I figured it would be an easy fix: call the hotel and explain the situation to get the money refunded to my account. Unfortunately for me, both times i called to try and explain, i was put on hold until the phone automatically hung up. I thought, maybe they're just busy and an email would be better, so i emailed them and hoped for a response. After days, there was no response, so i called again. Finally, someone was willing to talk to me and said they would refund the money. That would have been the end of it, but it's been over a week with no sign of a refund or even a call or email to update me if it is just running late or something. Throughout this whole process, I've tried to remain calm and cordial, but the customer service has been absolutely abismal, especially considering it's a matter of over 100 dollars. This feels like my last resort to get anything done. ",4,GUANLI,2023-01-19

Excellent top tier customer service. It was a surprise birthday stay. The front desk was very professional and even helped with the surprise. Even gave balloons to help celebrate and decorate. Best customer service. Above and beyond. Jessica at the front desk is phenomenal. ,10,Kadashia,2023-01-17

The rooms are nice and clean. Reception was not friendly. I requested housekeeping yet did not come to the room for 2 days. Onsite parking is 30 a day with in and out privileges.  However we found street parking each night. Hotel is about a 25 to 30 min drive to Manhattan. ,6,Miguel,2023-01-03

"really nice place overall, just a 10 minute walk to flushing main st station and literally down the street are like cafes and a chinese family restaurant. walk three blocks and you reach flushings chinatown that has plenty of food around with many stores and grocery stores. as well as a target that’s a 10 min walk away. super nice hotel that’s very accessible. ",10,Emily,2023-01-01
The hotel rooms are very clean and modern. Just as pictured on the website. The staff was helpful and friendly. The only thing I don’t like about it is the area in which the hotel is located. I wouldn’t feel safe walking around here. ,8,Julianne,2023-01-01
