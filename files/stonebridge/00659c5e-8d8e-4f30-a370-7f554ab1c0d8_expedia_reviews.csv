Not happy with Experian I booked a night for Saturday night but found they made it for Friday night so I lost $280.00 and had to find a different place to stay for another $309.00 I think this will be my first  and last experience with Experian ,2,Stanley,2025-09-07

"This property has now allowed pets on every floor. Big pets, small pets, loud pets and kids. I am allergic to animals, and had to self-medicate just to have a nightâ€™s rest. My room smelled like a wet dog!   Unfortunately, we will not be returning to this property, that my family have used for the last 4 years for our summer getaway. Very disappointing! And should have asked for my money back!",4,Andrea,2024-10-22

Great Residence Inn. Clean. Roomy. Comfortable bed. And breakfast included!  Always reliable. ,10,Harold,2024-06-08
"very nice and clean accomodation. Spacious room with Kitchenette however a little small for 4 persons as offered. Sleeping couch sufficient. We very much liked the facilities (fireplace, BBC-place, pool and exercise room). All very clean, inviting and easy to use. Very friendly front desk. Only complaints regarding the breakfast option. Quite monoton food offer through all day of stay. The  service team was hardly capable to run the buffet. Whenever you walked along something was missing (coffee, sausage, waffle dough, etc.). It did not meet our expectiations to repetitively ask for supply. We recommend an internship at Residence Inn New York, which we visited the week before to learn how to satisfy demand by keeping a smile!",8,Bernd,2024-06-03

Courteous front desk staff who offered restaurant suggestions for dinner. ,10,Michi,2024-05-26
"Check in was lengthy since we had to wait about 5 minutes for someone to appear at the front desk. We heard a lady in the back on a personal phone call, while yelling hello, we were ignored. Not sure if she was on break but she could have at least said someone will be with you shortly. Then a gentleman came and got us checked in quickly!

Also, not happy with the dramatic price change that occurred from my Hotels.com price to my actual invoice price. Over $300 difference but didnâ€™t want to ruin our perfect Motherâ€™s Day weekend so I didnâ€™t complain. 

Other than that, my family and I loved the facility. The space, convenience, hospitality of the hotel staff during breakfast were excellent!

It was a beautiful room and we were very happy i just am not happy that due to a computer issue i was charged two different prices for the same room and was told it was my fault.  When i called to make a reservation over the phone i was told over $200 dollars and said no thanks.  So i went on line while driving and it came up at the $175 so i booked it with my card.  When we arrived they said i had two rooms and i said no i didn't take it when i called.  So i am not happy as a royalty member how you could allow this to happen.  My understanding was you had my CC on file.  I as not happy to be changed twice.  Please see what you can do get some on my money back.  Thank you,4,TINA,2024-03-10

"We have stayed at this property before so felt comfortable booking again.  We had very noisy upstairs neighbors but that's beyond the control of the property. However,  the linens and pillows were awful.   The worst part is that the linens and towels smelled like skin oils and not clean.  It was very unpleasant and made us question the overall cleanliness of the hotel.  There was also mold in the shower.  We will go to another property in the area next time. A little bleach would go a long way",4,Alexander,2023-12-31

The staff who ran the breakfast were wonderful, the front desk staff had great recommendations and were knowledgeable of the area, the bartender was friendly and not overly chatty. The king suite we stayed in was AMAZING! Very clean, very spacious, classy with lots of accommodations. Location was perfect for touristy type things. Will definitely recommend to others and would come back if in the area. Thank you for everything!",10,Verified traveler,2023-12-10

"Everything was great! Perfect location on the main highway and everything was new! The rooms were designed amazingly! Everything you needed was there. Their breakfast was better than any other hotel that offered free breakfast. My only minor issue was I wish they offered coconut milk or almond milk for the coffee and some gluten free options for breakfast. Also I wish they didnâ€™t have carpet. Since it is a dog friendly hotel (which I appreciate) the carpets could have been replaced with tile or wood flooring. But these are more my preferences. Other than that, I would stay there again!!",10,Cassandra,2023-01-03
