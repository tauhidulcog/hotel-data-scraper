"I think it's ridiculous that after paying over $150/ night, i still had to pay $17 for parking!! Also, i reserved a room with a balcony and was not given one. The indoor pool was closed. It was for my daughter's birthday. Not getting the balcony and the pool being closed was definitely a disappointment. We went be staying here again. Also no free internet?? ",4,Jennifer,2025-09-21
Checked in late and went to my room in which I immediately left due to black stuff all over the tub and a very musty moldy smell in the room. It felt like I was in a damp basement. The staff was kind when I went back to the desk and asked to be moved to a new room and explained why. I was put in the room across from the first one which was better but still not great. I wouldn't recommend staying here. ,6,Kali,2025-09-21

"Checked in after a whole day flights and looking forward to catch some rest but the whole building suddenly blackout for about half an hour. Returned to the room with very noisy air conditioner with blackout thermostat. Shower was broken too. I booked King room with balcony, non smoking and was downgraded to Double Queen with much smaller square footage room as they were fully booked. Since it was close to midnight I just want to rest right away. Next day called the front desk for management. No return call. Have Expedia assist, DoubleTree do not respond again. Finally, Expedia assist again, the manager responded guest accepted the change, no apologies, no refund of the room difference in price... A non smoking room was booked but it had smoking smell. Note: bottle water is $3/bottle unless you sign up membership. Likewise, Wi-Fi is available to membership too. Doubletree once was our top list hotel to book, with this experienced, it will not even in our list for future bookings.",2,George H,2025-09-19

"The door to our room was extremely difficult to open and required significant force to get unstuck. The bathroom door had a similar issue. In addition, the smell of marijuana drifted into our room, either through the open patio screen or possibly through the air conditioning system.  The bathroom faucet was loose.   

The room was clean, and it was a quiet night.   The location was nice with a gas station very close. ",6,Troy,2025-09-11

"Terrible check in staff
Not friendly didn’t care, gave no info about where the room was or anything . She was more concerns that I pay for parking. In a regular lot on top of paying for room. Never asked if we were Hilton members which we are. I asked if there was drinking water in the room and she said yes. Then I got charged for the water. The old needing updated room was right over the pool. It was stuffy smelly and felt like i walked into 1965. I opened the door to the patio. And we were inside over the pool so no fresh air.",4,susan,2025-06-27

Well. I thought i had booked a king suite but was put in a double queen. The people down the hall were loud and annoying early in the morning. The elevator was hard to find with few to no signs to help. I walked all around the place to find them. It was also not clear which floor to take to get back to the service desk and ended up needing to take the stairs again. I am 7 months pregnant so it was a bit difficult. For the price they didn't have any complentary water.  They wanted another $3. That seems like a bit too much dor what i paid for just one night. ,6,Chandra,2025-05-30

"My only complaint is that I called the hotel on 5-6 occasions in an attempt to have some champagne and strawberries delivered to the room before we arrived.

"I have stayed at this hotel before, a long time ago and was really sad to see the major difference in quality. Let me say first that the service we received at the front desk and in the bar and restaurant were top notch. Checking in was a breeze but everything beyond that fell short. The elevator at the end of the building closest to our room had a sign pasted on it saying it was inoperable due to ""renovations"" which left us trekking halfway across the hotel to catch the elevator and head all the way back. If we'd been able to take that elevator, we wouldn't have had to walk back and forth down a stretch of about 8-12 rooms where the hallway smelled strongly of cat urine. The room was clean, but in need of major repair- mini fridge was broken and wouldn't close, showerhead (only sprayed at power wash strength) wasn't attached to the wall, the walls in the too small bathroom were dinged and gouged everywhere and the TV initially functional but then was blinking in and out while trying to watch ANY channel. After getting to our room any time we left thereafter, morning or night, our stretch of hallway was full of the smell of weed, I can only assume it's because we picked a room with a balcony. The food at Zink was actually surprisingly delicious, but painfully overpriced- nobody is going to pay $30 for an 8oz steak and fries in a mid tier hotel! Heads up-you'll need to pay for parking if you bring more than one vehicle, and the breakfast buffet also is not included. ",6,Amy,2024-10-21

"We stayed here twice, a month or so apart. 2nd floor both times. First time the room smelled a little off. Though, we understand cleaning chemicals and what not for maintenance. The second time, by the time we left, everything in our room was wet. I asked the lady at the front desk what the deal was while handing her the keys in paper wallet they gave them to us in, and even she stated with a wide eye expression and confused look “Even this is damp! Some rooms are just that way and some people prefer it because it is so dry in Colorado.” I lived there for 10 years. And we actually looked forward to no humidity coming from where we live now. Proceeds to tell me it’s random and they don’t know how or why but it’s possible with it getting hot and cold through the month. Next time if we ever have a problem with our stay again, ask to change rooms. Even after a 7 hour drive everything we had, concert posters were wet. Our bed, we thought felt weird initially after getting out of the shower the first night. After the second we started to notice the full extent of the humidity in the room. Secondly we were told to call or text for a shuttle back to the hotel. The shuttle dropped us off at a destination, we later requested pickup from that spot through text, no answer. Called, put on hold 5-10 mins. So we took an Uber back. The shuttle driver John was so sweet and was upset for us. Later, we get a text saying the shuttle only works in 5 miles” it dropped us off where we wanted pickup",6,Aaron,2024-09-13

Hotel is dated and needs refurbishing. Paintwork & woodwork was chipped & stained & there was often a damp smell in the room. Beds were comfortable & clean although housekeeping was skipped a couple of days & we had to request items from reception. A loud party took place in the rooms next to us. Security responded to our initial call at 22.30 but no sign when we rang them again at 3.00am!! Reception staff were conciliatory the next morning but despite offering us a compensatory meal the next day did not materialise!this,6,Roslyn,2024-05-08

Most everything was fine, except that, upon checking in at around 9PM, the desk agent was not able to program the keys--there seemed to be some problem with the online system.  Anyway, she was very good about it, and gave us food from the deli case gratis, etc.  Still, this should not happen.  Keys were slipped under our door by the morning.  These didn't work, so they had to be reprogrammed... That's the only complaint.

The pool is right in the open lobby area where the restaurant is, so even my kids were uncomfortable to swim with everyone right there.  And the outdoor pool never had pool towels, so you had to go into the restaurant area no matter what to get towels. The dresser inside our room was broken, so couldn’t use half of it.

We checked into our room and the carpet was damp and the room smelled of mildew. Thought perhaps they had shampooed the carpet. Next morning the hallway ceiling had collapsed and they were collecting water in a bottle. The carpet in our room was soaked and the coffee table was now a 45 degree angle and things were sliding off. They did put us in another room after several hours when one became available.

I booked this hotel specifically since I saw there was a jacuzzi in the king suite. The advertisement gave me false hope. I would’ve went somewhere else if I had known I was falsely advertised. For the most part the place was nice and clean. Towels and robes were rough and there was some mike and Ike’s found in the hotel room that wasn’t from our stay. I’m overall pretty disappointed since I solely booked this hotel for the in room jacuzzi. The bathroom toilet stopped filling up with water and couldn’t flush unless you filled it up with the sink water. Not sure what happened there either. Despite those things the rest of the pictures looks like the king suite. Has two big screen tv’s and also a built in tv in the bathroom mirror. A fridge but not full size more like a mini. No microwave or anything for cooking/utensils. There were cups and coffee with cream and sugar. ,6,Grace,2023-07-05

Not so good of a stay. Bought 2 rooms checked in early Friday afternoon and was told they were not able to place us in adjoining rooms. This is when it all started.  Air conditioning does not work!!  Very hot and muggy.  Air conditioner in one room was so loud that even if it would have worked you could not of slept. Was told there was not another room to be moved to. Not sure why the bathroom has the noisy annoying fan. It does not help the air flow in the bathroom.  Bathtub didn’t drain well.  No screen on the balcony door to help cool off the room.  On a busy Saturday with multiple events in town… bar was not open until 4 but the website makes you believe it’s going to be open.  Breakfast is $18. For the cost of our rooms I expect much better accommodations!!  Will not stay here again. ,4,Rhonda,2023-06-12

"I seriously think that people using a ""free night"" from Hotels.com are given inferior rooms. The property and lobby were very nice, as the was front desk personnel. My room was clean but a bit shabby. The cabinet holding the fridge was HORRID and made me glad I wasnt putting any real food in there. The bathroom had a sour odor which i could not pinpoint. The bathroom ""vanity"" was pretty beaten up and should havebeen replaced 5 years ago. My room was above the pool so I had to deal with screeching, unattended children my 2nd night and the following morning.",6,Joan,2023-06-04

"I'm pretty convinced that when you use a free night, they give you a room that is furthest away and perhaps not as well-kept as others might be.
The lobby & grounds are quite lovely. I didnt eat in the restaurant. The coffee venue is only open until 10 AM :( 
Between the lobby and the elevators, there is, what was for me, a very steep ""ramp"" which i had to push my luggage cart up. I'm 73 with a very bad knee. It absolutely sucked. I was afraid I, literally, wouldn't make it the last 15 steps. NOT IDEAL in any way. For that reason alone, I would not stay here again. Also, the ad says pet friendly but it doesnt say there's a $75 fee for said ""friendliness"". The bathroom has a sour smell that I cant pnpoint and the cabiet hlding the mini fridge is rotting and rather unpleasant to look at. I tried to adda photo but it won't load. ",6,Joan L,2023-06-03
