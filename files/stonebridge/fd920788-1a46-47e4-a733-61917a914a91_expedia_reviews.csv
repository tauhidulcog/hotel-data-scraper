Poor cleaning and very forgetful ,6,Shaikhah,2025-09-28
"Went to celebrate my mother’s birthday. Initially excited because room was beautiful and spacious. Quickly became a problem with stressed barking dog in the room next door. We checked in at 4:30, dog didn’t stop barking until 11:30 when the owners came home. The front desk offered to  move us, but we needed an accessible room and there were no other available. Front desk said they couldn’t do anything about the dog until midnight and then they could call the police. Absolutely awful. And then, to find out the room charge through hotels.com was double the price of what I would have paid booking through Marriott… ugh… done. ",4,Laura,2025-09-28

Excellent property luxurious spotless with great service.  Bellman and check in with Darlene went smoothly.  One small problem.  We asked to extend our stay one day.  They agreed and said the price would be the same.  The next day the bill was $200 more.  I spoke with the manager and he immediately corrected the bill and to apologize gave us a breakfast coupon.  Beautifully handled and much appreciated.  Great hotel with lots to do in the area.,10,Alan,2025-08-09

"Modern and clean hotel with a good restaurant, coffee cafe, and rooftop bar in the hotel. Very nice outdoor pool and hot tub. Spa available but didn’t book anything. Great shopping area outside the hotel. Only complaint is we stayed for 2 nights and housekeeping didn’t clean our room after the first night. We had to request fresh towels, more bottled water, bed was never made up, etc. For the nightly price, the room should be made up daily. ",8,Jennifer,2025-07-13

"The hotel has a great location.  We had a very comfortable room although the heating was a little loud.  The biggest disappointment was the cafe.  I ordered a very hot latte, well they tried 3 times but just couldn’t do it.  The pastries were not fresh, although they swear they were made fresh daily. All this trouble and everything is overpriced.  A hotel of the calibre should beef up their quality to go along with the high prices.",8,Rosemary,2025-01-10

"Nice property in a fun location.  It was loud downstairs and if your room is on the top floor near rooftop, be prepared for noise.  Heard people running down hallways.  Housekeeping service was sub par.  Did not have any linens for pullout, asked for them, they brought but acted annoyed.  Also didn’t have enough towels, asked for more but they never brought them. They had a wedding party with a late check out that I think impacted everyone checking in.  Some grumpy people in the check-in area waiting. Maybe our experience was abnormal.",8,Kate,2024-12-07

Went for a weekend trip. Spot is absolutely beautiful.  Perfect for before the holiday - lights music and amazing views of the area.  The hotel was beautiful.  Only downfall was how loud the doors slam shut for each individual room. One night it was a lot of slamming doors- not by anyone’s fault just the way the doors are designed.  Just something to be mindful of when staying here.  Otherwise hotel was perfect. ,8,Alyssa,2024-11-18
"We stay at this hotel for the weekend. When we got there on Friday, they allowed us to check in early, which was very nice. The hotel is decorated for Christmas and looks absolutely beautiful.


We’re on the second floor, right above the entrance. The hotel was pretty quiet with an occasional late night, drunk person from the wedding downstairs yelling. The rooms really nice, had perfect lighting and was very clean. The only thing I didn’t like about it was that they had shampoo, conditioner, and lotion that was a men’s musk smell. I did like that. They had bar soap from one of the stores downstairs though.


You can’t beat the location. It’s across the street from the Rockingham mall which is filled with stores and walkable. There are so many options for eating and shopping in the plaza where the hotel is, you don’t have to drive anywhere.


We will definitely be staying here next time we go up north to visit.",10,Stef,2024-11-17
"This hotel was nothing special. The staff was very friendly and it was clean. But we were told we were getting a VIP upgrade and we did not. We didn’t complain or say anything because we were only there for one night. The bed wasn’t very comfortable, neither were the blankets or pillows. And the elevator was broken so for a busy Saturday night it was a long wait getting and from. I wouldn’t stay again.",6,Melissa,2024-11-15

"Very comfortable, clean and great customer service. Cool area in general, hotel is very close to so many attractions. Doors were heavy, comforting in the feeling of security. They were loud when closing, but I never heard anything in the hall or another room. The air handler in our room was loud, but this wasnt a bother, actually helped the baby nap because we forgot to bring a white noise machine. Bed was extremely comfortable and the room had a nice large TV.",10,Kevin,2024-11-11

Hotel was really nice staff was nice room was nice  the things that we didn’t like was the bed was kinda hard our room was next to a stairwell so my husband had a hard time sleeping and the water in the shower took forever to get hot and I know the front desk told us about the parking ( $10) but when my husband checked his acct it should of been $270 and was charged over $300 and we don’t know why if someone can answer that question that would be helpful thank you ,6,Elizabeth,2024-11-10

This was a nice hotel but we had noise problems both days we were there.  Blaring techno music from a gym across the street from 8 AM to noon on Saturday morning and then we were awoken that night at 2:30 am by loud music that sounded like it was coming from the room next to us.,6,Mary,2024-09-12
We recently stayed there for a family wedding.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating.  Rooms were so clean and really nice.  The only thing that friends and family complained about was the spin classes going on outside that woke them up. It was a late night and waking up to loud music was not expected. Aside from that it was a perfect place.  ,10,fatima,2024-09-12

The hotel in general was beautiful. My only complaint was the young man at the bar that served us and in the morning and older woman who served our latte were a bit miserable. The concierge was extremely pleasant. I will return again but for a longer stay. Overall this hotel was wonderful!! Lots of great stores nearby ",10,Jennifer,2024-08-24
"The corner lake view room that I paid extra for, over looked the roof of the lower floor, so not as nice as I expected. But overall it was a beautiful hotel. I think they can only charge as much as they do, because it's the only nice hotel in the area. It's more expensive than it should be, but it was a nice stay. I would stay more often if it weren't so expensive.",8,Mary-Stewart,2024-08-24
"Everything was fine and the hotel is beautiful. The only downside was the change that they made on my reservation. I reserved a corner room with a lake view and they put us in another room, the reason given was “the room is out of service”. ",10,Claudia,2024-08-23

"Check in was excellent (shout out to Yerenia). Rooms were clean, fresh. Pool was very nice. We stayed in even while it rained. Restaurant has some delicious olive oil. Ahi Tuna & Beef Tartare were delicious. Servers were very friendly. Customer service was top tier at all point of contact. Bartender was very cool. Made some nice drinks. My kids absolutely loved their stay. I wish I had more time to explore the neighboring businesses. We were only in town foe the night, but we will definitely return end of August for a longer stay.

"I booked a 2 night stay at the Artisan hotel at Tuscan Village for a staycation and much needed time off. Check in was a breeze but I was told pool wristbands would be needed for the next day and the rooftop was closed. The next day I came down at about 11am for my passes and immediately felt put off and was asked if I was staying there lol I had my room key card in hand and she asked for my picture ID which is appreciated. She then asked if I was going there right now and how long I’d stay. I responded with I’m not sure I’m heading to grab coffee and a bite next door. 
She (Stephanie) then looked over at Vanessa who’s a manager and said “what is she asking for” extremely unprofessional and annoyed to say the least. I was completely confused at this point, Stephanie came back to explain there’s limited capacity at the pool today dude to the Fourth of July week (lol never heard of this at any resort/hotel ever.) she explained it’s best to return when I’m done getting food and return to grab them as they are doing time slots and condo residents have first choice of the pool lol. I was completely stunned at this point and had no other choice but to agree to come back. I walked out to the parking lot where my car was parked and passed by the pool I was even more surprised to see a handful of people laying out and 1 couple in the pool. I truly felt judged and humiliated. The next day on the fourth I was told by Chris a manager pool is only for residents that day lol complete waste",6,Alexis,2024-07-06
Overall a great experience minus the staff which they seem nice but are extremely busy all the time which brings their service quality down. Would recommend getting more people at the front desk. Everything else fantastic experience. ,8,Tiago,2024-07-06

"It took me about 20 mins to confirm my reservation, then I came back for check in and took an extra 30 mins waiting in line while two staff members without sense of urgency tried to manage 15-20 guests trying to check in, any manager would have solved this issue adding staff members during high volume times. It was crazy to see lack of organization.",2,Edgar,2024-07-05

"Would have been 5 stars had the inroom thermostat was able to be set lower then 66 degrees and the tv had the sleep timer work. My over all stay was good and the staff was on point but I have made this complaint to the staff before. Most places allow the ac to be set as low as 62. And being on the top floor with the room at 66 just made sleeping difficult because I kept waking up sweating. It’s pretty bad when the hallway can be set colder then the rooms.
But otherwise the room is VERY clean, the refrigerator is tiny, the beds super comfy along with the pillows. The bathroom is well different but no complaints there other than how freezing cold it gets even when the shower is running. It’s like cold air is pumping in there even when you have the heat on. 
Wish the in room ordering worked, especially for breakfast. ",8,Verified traveler,2024-06-17

"If you're with a group and there to drink and party I bet this place is wonderful, but if you want a quiet night with late evening room service then this probably is not the place. I stayed on a Friday evening and was surprised that there was no food on site after 10pm. The parking fee is a joke. Charged $20 ($10 each ""day"") to self-park in a lot where other retail stores are.",4,Toni,2024-06-03

"Relaxing by the pool is nonexistent due to the millennial parents drinking alcoholic beverages on one end of the pool while their obnoxious children squirt water guns at anybody and everything at the other side of the pool. On top of that the music is so deafeningly loud that you're guaranteed a migraine before an overpriced sub-par room stay (luxury bathroom includes a square toilet- uncomfortable as hell on my tush, drain in shower was clogged to the point of water overflowing, and towels were sparse).  This stay of course includes a hefty incidental fee that doesn't drop off your credit card bill for 2 weeks. But heck who cares cause you're getting the luxury vibe right?-- Haha! Sleep was also sparse due to tons of in-room after-parties allowing your migraine to continue between the yelling drunks and the consistent slamming of the doors that were even heavier than the ones at Macy's. Even the continuous wafts of pot smoke coming from the halls couldn't help relieve the migraine at 2 a.m. 
So, basically we stayed 1 night and were charged the following:  $252.00 (Discounted 2nd party rate from Expedia),  $20.00 parking fee for two cars, and I was charged $135.00 incidental fee that stayed pending on my  card for 2 weeks. Even though the fee will drop-off in two weeks,  I felt like I'd been jilted paying a total of $410.00 for 1 night in Salem, NH and no breakfast was included. Fabulous, I'll just go spend more money. I've had better stays at Best Western's.   Signed, Broke",4,Petter,2024-06-01

Nice hotel. Room was very cozy and comfortable: Only two negatives are 1.) the doors slam hard. So when others left their room it sounded loud in our room. 2.) Parking. The hotel had an event so when we stepped out and came back the guest from the event took all the hotel parking which should only be reserved for paying overnight guest. ,8,Natalie,2024-01-21

Hotel and surrounding properties were beautiful. However we were kept awake most of the night by loud wedding parties.
