Great stay in downtown Denver,10,Katherine,2025-10-06
"Very conveniently located for our events this past weekend.  The bar was closed when we got back from our concert, but the room was very nice, and the breakfast was amazing. ",10,David,2025-10-06
"Staff upon arrival and departure were great. Unfortunately, shortly after getting to our room, we discovered the TV wasn’t working. It would power on, but we couldn’t change the channel or use any functions. We called the front desk, and they said someone would come up right away. After waiting about an hour with no one showing up, we decided to head to dinner before our event.

When we returned around 11 p.m., the TV still wasn’t working. We also noticed the toilet tank had no water and wouldn’t refill after flushing. We called the front desk again and were told there was no maintenance on site, but the staff member could come up and try to look at it himself. By the time he arrived, we had managed to get the toilet working by turning the valve off and back on. We let him know and brought up the TV issue again, but he repeated that maintenance wasn’t available and began backing out into the hallway and then left. I let the desk know when we were leaving about the TV not working and the toilet issues. She was very nice and apologetic. ",8,Justice,2025-10-04
"Staff absolutely amazing!!!! 
Loved how dogs were welcomed!! However had planters blocked off for dogs :( we were able to find some turf but at the other hotel or pet place few blocks down. Yes it’s an “easy” walk however our dogs, they are still in training and bit of anxious of traveling. Having to walk that far was a very stressful experience for us and our dogs. While yes, our dogs or problems but they are also guests and should have at least one or two tree areas close by for convenience and inclusivity ",8,Xochitl,2025-10-02
Super easy and close to 16th St,10,Heather,2025-10-02
"Nice location, easy to get everywhere downtown.  Gabby at the hotel bar was so kind and accommodating.  Grab and go pantry is great.  Comfortable bed in a compact room.  Quiet.  Shower door design is allowing a lot of water out, which may be a maintenance nightmare down the road.  Would absolutely stay again.",10,Amanda,2025-10-01
"clean room, good attitude",10,Sang,2025-09-29
like the breakfast and 24 hour coffe,10,Howard,2025-09-27
Paying additional #60+ for parking is a bit outrageous.. P.S no shoes no service at breakfast!! ,8,Elynna,2025-09-25
"It was great, and very convenient to get to ball arena.",10,Denise,2025-09-25
There is no TRU sign in front of the building where the address is.  The entrance area is the worst that I've ever encountered. TRU shares the property with another Hilton property and all of the people checking in and going in and out of the building have about 8 feet to wiggle through the doors. The other entrance was shut down for our entire stay.,4,Mike,2025-09-24
"Good location, walkable. 
Elevators are slow and people tend to pile up",8,Tasia,2025-09-22
"Zero frills to where it was not functional.  No closet, just a hanging rail and some hooks.  Not even a single drawer for any unpacking.  No safe for valuables.  No place to sit except the bed or the single uncomfortable desk chair with no real way to watch the TV except laying on the bed.  Also, parking was problematic and they charged $64 per night for valet.  ",2,Kathy,2025-09-19
"Clean facilities, walkable location, easy valet parking, yummy breakfast. ",8,Kaitlin,2025-09-11

"Prior to booking the reservation online, there was no indication that they only do cleaning service on the rooms every second day. Was disappointed with that lack of service for the price of the room.",8,Paul,2025-09-09
For the price you pay the rooms are very crammed together. Walkways in the room are very small even for two of us staying it felt very small. There isn’t a pool and dining was very limited. ,4,Natalie,2025-09-08
The impression is in average level because of the timing of room cleaning up and arrangement need to be getting improvement.   ,6,HON SZE RICHARD,2025-09-08

"I had a pleasant stay at this property. I was in town for a convention for three days. Outside of the odd card slot you have to put something into for the lights to work in the rooms, and the mattresses that desperately need to be replaced, it was a great stay. It was quiet and clean. Nothing in the room was damaged or in disrepair. The complementary morning breakfast was decent. All-in-all, I would stay here again if they replace the mattresses.",8,Ryan,2025-08-25

"Personal wechselt zwischen freundlich und unfreundlich - meist nicht sehr hilfreich. Hotel abgenutzt und nicht sehr sauber. Nachbarschaft runtergekommen - viele Obdachlose. 
Achtung Parkplatz - wenn Valet Parking voll nicht in der Tiefgarage gegenüber Parken - überhöhte Raten - App funktioniert nie. ",6,Carolyn,2025-08-23
Close to Coors Field and Union Station.,10,Dena,2025-08-22
This place is super nice and clean and perfectly placed to go anywhere in downtown. It should be advertised better that there is ONLY valet parking. We were on motorcycles and still got charged for valet parking when we had to park our selves.,8,John,2025-08-21
It was short walk to Coors Field and an excellent breakfast available on premises. ,10,Dena,2025-08-21

We did not know it was vallet parking. Would have been good to know before we got there.,8,Kelsie,2025-08-18
"Overall it was great. The advertise having housekeeping every other day for long stays. In my experience, housekeeping solely dropped off towels but never took the dirty ones. Nor was it cleaned, the trash wasn’t emptied or the bed remade once. Was disappointed in that service. 
Breakfast was great and gym equipment was up to date. ",8,Candace,2025-08-18
"Room was not ready when we arrived, note we arrived 2 hrs after check in time. Over booking issues and staffing issues they also claimed the elevators were down for an hour. Pillows were horrible. Shower door was broken. Did not try the breakfast.",2,Verified traveler,2025-08-17
"Good hotel, conveniently located near Colorado Convention Center, 16th Street Mall area, and train station. Breakfast was good. Elevators were slow, but to be fair, the hotel was completely booked for the week I was there. ",8,Kevin,2025-08-17
"This hotel was very convenient to Ball arena. The guys at Valet parking were amazing and very fast. The room was comfortable except for: not completely dark when the sun came up so we were awake about 6:00; the blinking flash on the smoke alarm is way to bright as we thought it was lightening until we realized what it was; and the dispenser bottles in the bathroom were not user friendly. If the bottles are full, you can squeeze them easily, but if they are not full, you have to squeeze way too hard to get soap out. Would be hard if someone had arthritis in their hands. Bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good. We would stay here again but bring our own soap products. ",8,Wadene,2025-08-17
It would have been a much better stay with a microwave in the room. Riding the elevator 15 floors to warm food was terrible. ,8,Oliver,2025-08-17

"Great Hotel, elevators are rather slow, but no complaints about the hotel itself. Be aware that the Valet parking is rather steep at $64, it the only option for parking at the hotel. ",8,Curtis,2025-08-16
"Hilton TRU Denver seems to have hit the sweet spot in terms of location, quality and cost. Rooms are comfortable and have enough space to allow for open suitcases without it feeling cramped. With the shelves and desk space, my wife and me were able to have our own areas for unpacking without tripping over each other. Location in terms of proximity to 16 Street Mall and a short walk to the capitol made it an ideal location. ",10,Steven,2025-08-16
"The Hotel offers no discount parking, so overnight parking is $64.  The room is very small and furniture placement is difficult for two people to navigate around.  The room requires your door key to be placed in a receiver before you can use the bathroom lights- very odd.  The coffee bar in the morning had no cups.  I would not recommend this particular Hilton Property.  ",4,John,2025-08-15
,10,Raymond,2025-08-15
"Front desk staff was not welcoming at all. Both upon check in and leaving neither person even acknowledged me.

Muy rico el desayuno. Facilmente se puede llegar a pie desde union station o tomar el camion gratis que circula por la calle 16.Con seguridad volveria a elegirlo como hotel para hospedarse en el centro de Denver.

"I booked my trip until Friday, and when I showed up at 1am to check in they said it was until thursday. So I had to stand there for 30 extra min so they could figure it out and no resolution was made. they just comped my room for thursday night.

Quite a good gym, breakfast pretty basic and felt more like a prison canteen! 😂. If looking for a no-frills, good value option, this if a decent place to stay. ",8,Jack,2025-07-26

The chairs were up on the surrounding tables. There was a sloppily dressed woman sitting at the bar on her computer. Ee asked if the bar was open. She said yes, but didn't get up from her seat. We decided not to disturb her any further by asking her to do her job. This was not a pleasant stay at all. I used to enjoy it here. I won't be back. ",4,Andrea,2025-07-13

"The property is in a decent location. Their valet team were really personable. The beds are not comfortable and due to their 'under-bed storage area' they stick out farther than the mattress and I kept banging my knee. The pillows are not great, I had to get extras so my head wasn't laying flat on the bed. ",8,Angelina,2025-06-30
"Check in was easy, staff helped us out immediately. We loved the view from our room on the 17th floor. The beds were so amazing and firm, as well as the pillows. We all slept so good. We slept so good, we missed breakfast, but we've heard that was good too. Wished they had a pool, but other than that it was an amazing stay, would stay here again. ",10,Belen,2025-06-30
It was a great stay and room,10,CONNIE,2025-06-29
"I had a confirmed reservation from June 15th to June 20th, 2025, and due to a flight delay, I arrived at the hotel around 2:00 a.m. on June 16th. Despite my confirmed booking and me being very tired after traveling, the guy at the front desk staff informed me that I would need to wait until 3:00 a.m. to check in because he was “doing something on the computer.”

This response was unacceptable. I was already charged for the night of June 15th and had every right to access my room immediately upon arrival. I was extremely tired and needed to rest in order to attend a work-related conference early the next morning. This delay in service impacted my ability to prepare for an important professional meeting.
Not a hotel I can trust for work related activities. ",4,Johanna,2025-06-28

"Overall this was a nice hotel! The rooms are a bit small but very clean. If you're on the street side you do hear noise from traffic and the light rail, nothing some white noise or the TV can't drown out though. No coffeemaker in the room (they have coffee and hot water for tea downstairs) but there is a small mini fridge. The staff was kind and very responsive to any requests we had for extra towels, toiletries, etc. Make sure you get a physical key card, you'll need it to turn on the bathroom and hallway lights (so strange). Be aware that they do ask for your credit card when you check in so make sure you have it with you, especially if you're traveling on a business card. Breakfast was included in the stay but was a bit lackluster, good enough if it's your only option but there are tons of restaurants within walking distance too. The hotel is only a block away from the Convention Center, and 16th Street (one block up) is a walkable strip of shopping and restaurants for almost a mile. We didn't use parking but the valet is pricey. It's really easy to use rideshare options in the downtown area, though.",8,Ashley,2025-06-16

"The rooms are a little too open air for me, no dresser drawers,  no closet, so everything is just laying out in the open. I don’t know if they had a temporary problem with the water heater, but I had to run the hot water for over 5 minutes before I started getting hot water. I had booked a room with a bathtub, but when I checked in it was only a shower. Front desk told me I could only get a room with a tub if I needed accessibility, which I don’t, so I didn’t get a tub.

Improvement areas include getting more help for the breakfast.  The only worker seen was doing a great job replacing traits of food,  coffee and hot water carafes, emptying trash,  taking away dishes,  etc. , but it is more than a one person job! Also, the check in area by valet parking is way too tight as it is by the entrance and exit. ",10,Frederick,2025-05-24

One thing that I found interesting is that 3 convenient entrances from the street all directed to enter through the garage entrance. Not a big inconvenience at all, just wonder why the other doors were locked. ",10,william,2025-05-18

"This was our second stay here. I love that it is so close to the Performing Arts complex.
Our room was good again.
The breakfast experience was not as good as our first stay.
The repeatedly ran out of clean plates and a long line formed while waiting for plates. Things weren't as well stocked as the previous visit. And then I watched an employee stocking coffee lids drop a stack of them on the dirty floor, scoop them up and put them out at the coffee station. Yuck.
I would still stay here again, but really hoping the breakfast room is working well the next visit.",8,Marnie,2025-05-12

"We stayed five days, four nights, and housekeeping never serviced our room. One day as we were leaving, housekeeping was in the hallway. I let them know that we were going out and that they could clean our room uninterrupted while we were gone. When we got back three hours later, the room was as we had left it. I went to the front desk, and told them what had happened. Their response was that the cleaning staff doesn’t speak English. I have no idea why that was an excuse for skipping our room. I requested fresh towels at least, and those were delivered within the hour. However, no wash cloths were brought to the room. I called the front desk to get some, was told they would be delivered right away, but none ever arrived. As a result of no housekeeping being performed, I had to empty the trash myself several times and take the garbage to one of the common area trash containers. Unbelievable and unacceptable!",2,Verified traveler,2025-05-05

Room was small, didn't have convenient ways to charge devices, felt dark and dingy. Guy at the front desk was unfriendly and unhelpful when I needed clarification about parking (ended up paying a lot of money for just a few hours overnight, then having to get up to move my car at 5:30 to avoid another $60 fee for what would have been just another hour before leaving).

We must have been placed on the party floor, as we barely rested due to people running up and down the hallway all night. One elevator was down for maintenance, so trying to catch the other three was tough as the cleaning ladies were in every elevator. Finally, one let us ride down with her.  The breakfast was sub-par.

Not enough pillows on a king size bed- only 3, we waited 1 hr to get 3 more.

Não fizeram a limpeza diária do nosso quarto, identificamos na hora do almoço e quando solicitamos disseram que não iam fazer pois so iriamos ficar 2 diárias. Ainda assim meu marido insistiu que estávamos com crianças e precisamos da limpeza e eles simplesmente ignoraram. Quando chegamos não tínhamos toalha para tomar banho, não tinham tirado o lixo do banheiro e nem arrumado as camas.  Um absurdo um hotel desse nível ter um serviço tão ruim. 
Café da manhã também bem ruim, com pouca opção e qualidade ruim.
Hotel é novinho, banheiro bom, cama muito pequena, travesseiros ruins, com serviço ruim, mas numa ótima localização.

"We were there during NYE.. our bed frame was broke, and the mattress was incredibly uncomfortable. We had to request room service after 3 days into our 6 night stay. They we did come in and clean it though. 

Rooms are a bit small and could use a good scrubbing, it’s grimey and kind of just surface cleaned. 

Would be willing to come back due to the location being relatively close to the convention center & free breakfast. ",6,Celina,2025-01-04

O hotel tem um fluxo auto de pessoas, é gente o tempo todo entrando e saindo do elevador. Nao tem segurança na entrada e encontrei um morador de rua andando pelo saguão do hotel, o que me deixou bem desconfortável. A estrutura do hotel é ótima, tem valet por $56 dólares valor do dia todo e pode tirar o carro quantas vezes quiser no dia. Mas vi que tem estacionamento próximo tambem. No geral o hotel é bom!

"The hotel was in great condition and the room was really good. Very big bathroom which was a plus. The bad part was the breakfast. There were never enough forks during our 3 days. On the last day I ate eggs with a spoon. Although the quality of the food was good there wasn’t enough of it. On Saturday they ran out of coffee during the 45 mins we were there. Then came up and the lobby also didn’t have coffee. The day before no creamer of any kind. It was busy and I get that but the dirty dishes were pilling up and no one removed them. I have pictures of it. Every time you asked someone for something they would pass the buck. I stopped at the front desk and asked for a late check out because my daughter got sick during the trip. The young lady said yes after confirming we were rewards members. Then she no. “I read the screen wrong, call tomorrow and they can deal with it”. She also passed the buck. Great hotel but service was just ok",6,Luis,2024-10-13
"There was a lot of doors slamming, especially in the morning. And people being super loud in the hallways which echoed in our room. It is kind of a bummer that the parking costs an additional $56 per night but it’s in such an inconvenient spot that you almost have to use that valet…so I paid almost $300 for one night and it was a below average experience and I could have probably had the same but cheaper experience at a motel.

"Our room was clean and fairly comfortable.  (We both banged our knees repeatedly on the beds' platforms.)  Parking is brutally expensive and very hard to find.  (We had to call the hotel twice to find the valet entrance.)  Staff is friendly but will not go out of their way for you.  I wanted a bucket of ice, but couldn't find an ice bucket in the room.  I went down to the front desk and they said the ice buckets were next to the ice makers, which were only on three floors in the 21-floor hotel.  I checked all three ice makers, and there were no ice buckets.  I called the front desk and told them.  They said they would send up a bucket of ice.  Instead they just sent a bucket and I had to repeat my visit to the ice maker.  To get a bucket of ice took me close to 35 minutes.",6,Laura,2024-10-07

"The Tru brand is more modern in its decor than we would usually choose, and the room was smaller than we were hoping; however, it turned out to be a pleasant stay. We loved the shower and the breakfast the most, and its location to transportation and/or walking was excellent so we didn't need to rent a car. There were some minor things we needed from housekeeping (two more pillows, a kleenex box, and a washcloth) which  the desk made sure we got quickly). The recycling bins by every elevator and the eco-friendly toiletries were also appreciated.",8,Verified traveler,2024-10-07
"This was a nice clean hotel with a very urban vibe and less than a mile from the train station back to the airport so walkable. The breakfast was pretty good with a lot of choices. Only complaint was that they gave us a BOGO ticket for the bar. We were only there 2 nights, went down to use it the second night only to be told the bar was closed today. Saturday Bar Closed? What. Oh well, must have been a reason, but it was a little annoying.",8,jo,2024-10-06

"Even though we had a reservation, we were informed our room was not available and told to walk in the middle of the night to another hotel, check-in there, check out the next day (11am) and check-in back at 3pm. The attendant (Rain McIlvoy) was dismissive, unapologetic, and said he had dealt with this type of situation before. There was at least another guest that was relocated from the Tru By Hilton to the same hotel were we stayed that night. They overbooked the hotel. We had to wait at the Tru By Hilton almost 2 hours, while Rain took care of the paperwork and confirmation, before we could go to the other hotel.",2,Paulo Manuel,2024-10-05

The site is close walking to Convention Center however they have multiple entrances but only allow use of one under their valet service door.  It’s heavy in a downtown area where homeless individuals do attempt to enter; I stayed Sunday through Wednesday and my room was not cleaned at all or refilled … it’s two hotels in one … I will not be staying their again though.,6,Larry,2024-10-02

I don’t like sticker shock which is what I got when checking in for an additional $120 added onto card in case I do damage. I get it’s refundable but they charge your card for it at desk. And the person at desk moved onto next person with an attitude before I was done talking to her. And then parking was $56 a night. I found a garage near hotel for half that.

"Our stay was really nice, our grand kids loved it.  Although on the website .it states you have Arcade/game room.  There was only one shuffleboard game.  We chose it for the arcade so grand kids cpuld have entertainment . We were disappointed in the false advertisemet.  The view was really nice from the room.  Although privacy was a concern.  We could see through the blind into a hotel room below even with the blind pulled.  There was a man laying on bed could clearly see him with blind pulled.  I would reccomend changing this for privacy.  Also the hotel did not mention the parking at the hotel would be $56.00 a night extra .  The walking around the downtown denver area at night is not recommended. There were alot people wondering around close to dark. Not aomewhere i want to take grandkids. ",8,Angelia,2024-08-06

"I’m enraged! I got a charge after check out and wasn’t notified of it.

This is not true at all and it’s so crazy that they are lying about this situation and refusing to provide proof of this incident. The fee was almost $300 for something that I didn’t even do.

Although I occasionally heard drunken pedestrians making noise at night, I stayed on the 13th floor, so it was within an acceptable range. The room was a bit small, but it was sufficient for me alone. The only downside was the loud noise from the air conditioning unit, which made a distinct clicking sound, like an old plastic switch, every time it turned off automatically. This was quite noisy at night. The breakfast options were limited, but they had my favorite orange juice, yogurt, and scrambled eggs. I hope they can offer more variety in the future. The noise from the neighboring room was noticeable but didn't last long. Overall, it was a pleasant stay.",8,Xiyang,2024-07-11

We happened to see 2 housekeepers in the hallway and had to ask for fresh towels; they did not offer to take our old dirty used towels. We specifically asked for housekeeping and they never came. We were gone all day and when we come back and ready to shower and get dressed for the evening, housekeeping knocks on door. We told them now was not a good time and asked if they could come back the next day. The next day, they never came to clean the room. We even received a call from the front desk - they asked if we would like housekeeping today. I replied YES. We were gone again all day and housekeeping never came. I think it's ridiculous that in 5 days, 4 night stay they never gave housekeeping services - no new towels, no toilet paper, no new sheets, old used towels never picked up, and the soaps/shampoo/conditioner were never refilled.

"The tru by Hilton was an alright stay, rooms were the size of a postage stamp, seemed clean but spilled a drink and had to wipe the floor up...towel came away black so rooms are just clean to look at. Staff was helpful and the area was alright, 16th Street Mall is so close and has good food options, under construction while we were there but obviously no fault of the hotel! Breakfast was okay the first day but after that food was very mediocre and had to wait a long time for food to be brought out. Had to wait forever for the elevators every single time so don't book your Uber before you leave your room. If I had to I'd book here again but would look at what the other options are first.

"Couldn’t check in until after 5. I’m sure it wasn’t the staff's fault, but they said nothing, like that’s just how hotels work. They kept telling us “maybe 20 minutes longer” for our room to be ready, but it never was, so they said they’d call. We went across the street for a drink and they never called. We came back and it was ready, so I mentioned the phone call and they insisted that wasn’t something they did. All in all the hotel is okay - it’s decorated like an 8-year olds version of an IKEA room, but that’s fine and functional. But the pillows and bedding were just trash. The iron was unusable. Just a zero effort hotel surviving based on the Hilton name and the good location. Not recommended. The valets were on point, though, a bright point in an otherwise very forgettable stay.",2,Robert,2024-04-07

The staff was great, the bartender friendly and helpful, and the room was wonderful. After these experiences, I was excited to book yet another stay here. Upon checking in and arriving to our room, we notice the room size difference. Our first couple of times, we had plenty of space with a kitchenette. This time, we were in a MUCH smaller unit. No kitchenette and the room was half the size. With paying the same amount we did the first few times, we were extremely disappointed to not receive the same type of space/unit that we experience the first few times and ultimately why we decided to return. I felt robbed of space and amenities while paying the same amount. very disappointing and makes me hesitant to book here again.",8,Meghan,2024-03-06

When I checked out, I asked for a bill but was told since I used a booking service, I would get it in email (not true, I chose to pay at the location). When I got my CC bill, I noticed a $52 per day parking fee. I called the hotel and was told a 3rd party manages the parking and there was nothing they could do. $52 per day is ridiculous and I am sure this is a regular complaint.

I have never been treated so poorly by anyone in my entire life. Completely discriminated against i will not allow you to get away with the way i was treated as well i will be speaking with an attorney today or tommorow about the treatment i received there. You know exactly who I am its a shame people like you are representing such a great company and the Hilton name. Doubt you will be for long. The crew i dealt with when i first arrived was amazing as far as the rest of my stay complete nightmare and no one should ever be treated the way  I was treated. Theyy did it with no shame as well and no offer to help compensate for expenses that they caused me to incur. Absolutely one of my worst experiences ever.,2,Daniel,2023-12-14

Valet is the only option they have for parking here and it was $52! It was half of the cost of the actual stay and definitely not worth it. This was no where listed upon booking. Calling the front desk resulted in a busy signal with 6 tries in attempt to alert the valet to bring the car to the front so it would be ready as I was on a a tight schedule. When I checked out only one rep was visible. How can they collect so much money from parking but not have enough people to answer front desk calls?,2,Jovan,2023-12-14

Theres a tiny refrigerator under the ironing board and wall pegs to hang clothes up on (no closet). Right across from the refrigerator is a bench straight across that doesnt give much walk room. The bed is straight across from the banch and a little desk and chair. Bed was big (king) and comfy 😊 its for a solo person and just there to sleep and leave. Had a couple of friends over.

The lobby of the hotel is amazing. So pretty with so many different seating areas. The room was relatively small but that’s to be expected with downtown. The pillows were awful which made it rough for a 3 night stay. I also wasn’t a fan of having to go to the front desk to request an ice bucket as it is such a large hotel this definitely takes some time. An ice bucket in the room is a staple in most hotels so I’m not sure why they don’t provide one in the room here. Breakfast was great and well-run as well.

"Nice, compact room with all the amenities, an efficiency if there ever was one. Stayed 2 nights. When we entered the room, there was a nice greeting on the TV that had been programmed with my name. But that’s all we saw on the TV for the next two days. Remote did not work, and after several attempts to reset it, and several calls to the front desk to get someone to come help, we had to accept that it wouldn’t work. A functional TV does not make or break a trip, but it is a customary amenity that should work. The frustrating part was the way the team handled it. First call - was told maintenance would be up in a few minutes. They never showed. We left for the night, then came back and called again. At this point, the front desk told me that someone had entered the room and fixed it (even though we had put the do not disturb sign on!). It still didn’t work, and I asked what could be done. Chris, the front desk employee, proceeded to tell me that it was no big deal and that if it were him, he’d be fine with it not working. That there are other things we could do with our time. Wow! Couldn’t believe he was so emboldened as to tell me how to spend my vacation and what should be important to me.  We tried again the next day to get a maintenance call, but they again didn’t show up. Customer service was not a prevailing trait of the front desk staff. Doug in the bar was amazing, and the hotel was clean and contemporary. Would not stay there again.",8,Mark,2023-10-31

This property is gorgeous and very clean.   You feel good when you're there.  The breakfast was delicious and offered many choices.   The Denver Free Mall Ride bus is right outside the door.   It will take you to the famous Union Station downtown Denver.  I highly recommend this facility.,10,Scott,2023-10-23

I can’t say enough about this hotel. From check in to the amazing free breakfast (huge and a lot of options) and the friendly staff I definitely would stay here again. Close to everything definitely walkable to most stuff downtown. We were there for a concert at the ball arena and it was close. I definitely will be back next time I come to Denver. ,10,Veronica,2023-10-22

Checked in after booking King Room to be given two twin beds and less square footage. Was told since we booked through third party it was not guaranteed.

"I did not end up staying at the Tru Hilton my reservation got moved to the Slate. I was told that it was an upgrade, but I got put in the basement. My room was very small and dark.

Hated to have to go to the basement just to get a cup of coffee. Easy fix put a coffee maker in room. On busy street under construction very unhandy access and sirens through the night. Room was very small ok for one night has I had an engagement that kept me out of the room most of the evening.

The room is small, hurt shin on bed multiple times, breakfast area had food and forks on the floor entire time eating, very low water pressure in sink, no washcloths in room at check in, alarm lights flashing all night inside room. Also, the rudest and laziest front desk person I have ever encountered at a hotel. So disappointed in my first trip to Denver. Never staying at a TRU Hotel again but very sure they don’t care.

"We weren't sure what to expect, TBH, but Tru by Hilton was fantastic. The renovations are modern and comfortable, updated to accommodate technology and not just a few loose, half-functional wall outlets. 

We didn't realize how many large events were being held in Denver this weekend, so the lobby was busy and cramped. Because of the increasing problems with area security, only one outside door is available for entry, which crams everyone into a very small space at a single tiny reception desk. The staff, although very busy, was friendly and welcoming to everyone, and very efficient.

This is probably one of the quietest hotels we've ever stayed in. Even the street noise of a very busy downtown city was muted. We did have to call the front desk when the occupants of another room decided to have a screaming match at 3:30am, but security responded immediately and professionally. 

We parked at another lot because the overnight parking charge was over $50, which is excessive. For a one block walk we paid $35 less, also in a secured garage. 

The location is ideal and walkable to anywhere you need to go downtown.",10,Pam,2023-09-25
"Talk about an expensive hotel night and the smallest hotel room in the world! The bed was on a ""platform"" that I bumped into 25 times. Unfortunately the room was so small it was impossible to avoid it. Downtown rates? Maybe. But wow... ",6,Abigail,2023-09-25

The room didn't have a coffee machine, which was a minor nuisance. However, the room (and the whole hotel) was without hot water for most of my one-night stay. This is pretty inexcusable in a large chain hotel in a major destination city.",6,JONATHAN,2023-09-16

It is especially convenient to the 16th Street Mall free bus (which, due to construction on 16th, stops in front of the Tru Hotel, on 15th), making it easy to get to Union Station for the airport train, and other points of interest in downtown Denver. The hotel staff is always so helpful, storing luggage before/after check-in/check-out times, making recommendations for restaurants/activities and directions. The hotel breakfast is very good, with a great variety each day, with food served hot and fresh. Unfortunately, like all of downtown Denver, safety is a concern around the hotel. ",10,KENT,2023-09-13

"A very basic hotel, especially considering its high price. I chose it because of its location, within easy reach of Union Station, good for rail, bus and airport connections. It was clearly very recently fitted-out, but the facilities were minimal (e.g. room quite cramped, no coffee/ tea in the room, minimal toiletries). Also badly fitted out. The bathroom shelf was completely loose in its brackets (wrong thickness for the brackets) and the brackets themselves were loose. (Things put on the shelf, slid off at the front.) The door strike plate was completely loose (screws undone by about a quarter inch). I think the fixing itself was pretty cheap, so would be hard to actually do up tightly, though screwing in with my nail file did make it a bit better!
The price did include breakfast, but I didn't test this, because of my time constraints",6,Peter,2023-09-11

When checking in the first day the staff member was incredibly rude. I didn’t think anything of it but a little later i went to ask a question and all i got was a super snarky response. Overall the only parking is valet which isn’t bad but for $52 a night it’s pretty steep. I’ve spent less in bigger cities at higher end hotels. Felt that was a bit out of touch. The room wasn’t bad it was clean and cozy. Outside of the hotel it was like skid row which is kind of unsettling as far as walking around the city went. ,8,Trevor,2023-08-07

We do have one big moan though. The guy that checked us out of our two rooms just didn’t listen to us in how we wanted to pay for the “incidental hold” on our credit card and despite clearly explaining to him how we wanted to pay and him assuring us that it had been put through this way, we’ve been hit by our UK credit card company for charges which were totally unnecessary.

"When I checked into the hotel, I was only asked to provide my drivers license in order to verify my reservation. After being provided with my room key, I was informed that one key would be used to turn the lights on in my room.  When we entered our room,  there was already a key in the light slot, there was a white powder substance on the carpet; white footprints on the floor; and a walkie talkie in the room. My online reservation was for a 2 Queen bedroom - we were given a 1 king bedroom. With a dog and guest with me, I did not want to inconvenient the guest by sharing a bed. I went back to the front desk and informed them of my online reservation. I was told that since I made a reservation through a third party my room is not held and if someone were to come in and need a 2 Queen reservation then my room would be given - which in this case it was given out to another customer and they did not have any other 2 Queen room reservations available. When I asked why I was not informed of that my room was no longer available, so that I could make other arrangements, they said they had no way to contact me. I informed them that in order to make a reservation I had to provide my email address and phone number and that I have been receiving emails from the hotel regarding their hotel policies; and they did NOT ask for my phone number when I checked in - SO IT WAS ON FILE. They proceeded to lie that they couldn’t contact me. We were ONLY provided with a new king room for the night.",2,Kyla,2023-06-25

Scary little detail.   Our day did not latch on its own when it shut.   Your had to make sure to give it a tug or push after it closed.  The shower door did not close completely thus the floor could get soaked if I had hadn't caught it.  I simply pointed the shower head away from the door which limited the problem.,8,Mary,2023-06-20

"i was a little disapointed that the room wasn't really clean and the wifi was hard to connect (they messed up with my name and my roommates name so couldn't connect and wouldn't give me a code to connect for a call while they sorted out where things went wrong). the workout room was great, and the bartender was super helpful/nice, and the breakfast was also great.  Also wasn't super excited that i couldn't use my hilton frequent traveler number as i had booked through a third party (expedia)... that doesn't make any good business sense in my opinion.",6,Margot,2023-06-05

"Second time staying at this hotel, and selected it again based on prior accessibility to downtown and previous experience staying last year. I was also aware of the valet fee going into my reservation so there were no surprises there.
