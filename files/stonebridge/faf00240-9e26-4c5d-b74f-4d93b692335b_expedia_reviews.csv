"This hotel nickel and dimes you on everything. 

Parking? Extra charge ($16 a night!!) 
If you use the mini fridge? Extra charge.
Want breakfast? Extra charge.

Fan in our bathroom didn't even work and the bed covers were like plastic.

Completely overpriced at $159/night.",2,Kimberly,2025-10-03

"The lack of free parking was not disclosed at all on Expedia website and inadequately disclosed on the hotel website. No yogas mats in the gym, other guests and I were on the dirty carpet with little towels. And no free breakfast in contrast to Hyatt Place across the street. A huge disappointment ",2,Mark,2025-09-26

"This hotel needs some work.  Cosmetic issues from the lobby to the room.  Room was not cleaned properly and fridge was broken, shower missing shower gel with what looked like mold in the holder.  Ordered a king bed but given two queens.  Told hotel was booked to capacity.  Does not make sense that if i book that room dont give it to someone else.  For the price tou can find better",6,jimmie,2025-09-15

"Awful.  Stayed in hotel several times before.  This is hotel in suburban parking lot, plenty of spaces.  Now they’ve imposed ridiculous parking fees.  When you check in there is a 30 minute line with guests asking how to scan the signs that mention parking fees.  Front desk people say it isn’t their fault. Received ticket after having to wait in line .  Scum bag hotel.  BOYCOTT HOTEL.  ",2,mitchell,2025-09-15
"My sister and I attended a family wedding in Denver on Sunday. We checked in between the ceremony and the reception which the hotel was in between the church and event center which made it convenient.  Our check in was alright, a little slow but there was someone ahead. The hotel personnel advised us that when we return we'd have to register the car for parking which would be 16.00. We thought that was extreme. When we return hours later and we parked and went in to register the car and pay at the front desk. However it all had to be done through this website, the hotel didn't handle that at all. I thought well that's not good service at all if you can't just pay the cash directly to the hotel. The room was fine, small but the restroom we was tiny. Just large enough to turn around, no vanity just a small strip around the toilet to sink. You couldn't put anything of size out. We had to use the countertop out where the coffee and water were. The toilet also very small and set low. The bed's were very comfortable and we both slept well. The next day we checked out and my sister wanted a snack, so she got crackers a Hershey Almond bar and a water bottle. It was 19.46 which again shocked us both. Especially since the parking was 16.00. We both felt the prices for parking and snacks are out of control. It worked out for our convenience but I don't think I'd could recommend it to others.",6,Jonathan,2025-09-14

"The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. We needed more towels, we immediately got more towels. We needed to store luggage and were kindly given tags for storage. I forgot my medication for my multiple sclerosis and called and the cleaning staff had set it aside for my daughter to pick it up. The employees were so helpful and happy to greet us each day. We also enjoyed the flavored water that was regularly freshened up and displayed so we could fill our water jugs everyday. It is close to DU, where my daughter attends college. I will be staying here again! I highly recommend this hotel. ",10,Emily,2025-09-10
"It was a comfortable, clean stay. The food at the onsite restaurant is excellent. The only thing is that there seemed to be only one worker at the time we came in for dinner and it was not busy at all and she was bartender, waitress and bringing out the food. The next day for lunch was similar although there seemed to be another person behind the bar as well.  Overall, excellent food and worth the wait. I did not like that the parking fee was $15 per night considering the parking lot is small.  I don't see why a fee has to be added. ",8,Denise,2025-09-08

"I loved the stay. The only downside was that the hot tub is under repair, but we knew that. The room was clean, quiet, well equipped and very accessible. I thought that the hotel noise level might be noticeably high being close to the interstate and Colorado Blvd., but it wasn’t. Even with an entire football team of 65 or so on the upper floors we heard no extraneous noise. I would happily choose this Courtyard again a will. ",10,Kevin,2025-09-01

"We did like the location, but charging per person, per car when we were all meeting for a family activity was outrageous.  So 4 people and 3 cars being charged $45 a day for parking?  Beds were hard, hot tub was not even running. No breakfast even offered - $854 for 2 nights disappointed as we could have stayed down the street for half of that. ",4,Michael,2025-08-19
"My husband and I lived in this part of Denver for ten years and come back every summer to visit family and friends. We've stayed at this hotel on our annual visit for the past three years, but after this stay, we won't be booking here again. We checked in around 9:30pm and wound up being given a room right behind the elevators. I'm pregnant and already sleep terribly and the elevators moving and making noise could be heard throughout the room. I quickly returned to the front desk and asked politely if there might be any way to switch rooms, explaining my current situation. The gentleman at the desk responded curtly with, ""No, it's not possible. When we're busy, it's my job to make sure that people who book through third-party websites get the least desirable rooms."" I understand that we had checked in later in the evening, but 1) why would you admit to that policy, and directly to a customer? and 2) when I asked if perhaps we could switch rooms the following day as people were checking out and rooms were being cleaned and turned over, he said no. Between that, the parking fees, and very high price for an older hotel with few amenities to offer, we'll be looking at other options for next year. ",6,Verified traveler,2025-08-19

"Enjoyed the queen size bed room with sofa bed which was comfortable to relax on with a book. 3rd floor offered a nice view of the mountains with beautiful sunsets. Never had to wait long to use the elevator- there are 3 of them.

He was awesome. The furniture in the rooms is very worn and dated. The bed was like a sheet of plyboard. I woke up sore instead of rested. ,6,ANNA,2025-08-11

I was a little surprised that there was no housekeeping service unless you stayed more than three nights, at least that’s what the front desk told me. They did come by on day three, but it was late in the afternoon and I was napping,  so I just got a few clean towels and toilet paper.  it was fine, but I’m just not used to that at a hotel.",8,Nancy,2025-06-10

"This was a combination business/pleasure trip. The temperature in the room was good--the HVAC worked well.  There are plenty of elavators so we never waited long for one.  The staff was especially helpful and nice--even gave us a late checkout on the last day to accommodate my mid-morning doctor's appointment.  Colorado Blvd is very busy and though the hotel sits back a little ways, the road noise can still be an issue.  We may elect to get a room with a mountain view next time (on the other side of the hotel) even though they charge more for it.",10,Teresa,2025-06-04

"Alarm was preset to 6:35 am, and it kept going off even after unplugging it. We had to take it to the front desk still beeping before we could get back to sleep. This cost us 2 hours of our vacation that disrupted our rest and plans for the next 2 days.

Blackout drapes leave huge streams of light.
Lumpy pillows, hard bed, half broken lamp switches that sometimes worked.
Lobby music too loud. 
Surprise parking fee.
Unknowledgable check-in clerk.
Definitely won't stay at a Courtyard ever again.",4,Verified traveler,2025-05-25
Very surprised that the windows didn't have blackout shades!! There is a shade but it has holes in it and doesn't secure against the two sides of the wall so the sun comes in. No free breakfast. The room door not fastened securely so it would vibrate and noise with the pressure in the room or when somebody else next door came and went. The pool and jacuzzi did not smell or feel clean. The pool towels way too small. Will never stay at another Marriott.,6,Arthur Alexander,2025-05-25
The location was good – it was where I needed to be. The property seems worn out and worn down. The room was small and worn. The bathroom was tiny – the bathtub/shower was awkward to get into and the water never got any hotter than warm. There were lightbulbs missing in some of the fixtures. Period just very tacky.,6,Susan M,2025-05-23

"My stay at the Courtyard was comfortable.  It was accessible by public transportation,  and not too far from Amtrak.  The only complaint that I have is that they tend to have a backup for check in. When I arrived, it was in the evening, and I had to wait for another person to come to assist the person working the front desk.  The people were friendly and helpful. I would recommend it, and would stay there again.",8,Verified traveler,2025-05-21
"I had a pleasant stay at this hotel. The front desk staff were courteous, professional, and very informative, which I really appreciated. It was also a big plus being close to a place where I could grab food and a drink. The only downside was that there wasn’t any printed information in the hotel room about amenities, Wi-Fi, checkout times, safety exits, or nearby emergency contacts. I would have really appreciated a binder or guide with restaurant info and hotel details, as that’s something I’ve found helpful at other hotels. Overall, it was a good experience, but adding in-room information would definitely improve the stay for future guests.",10,Kandess,2025-05-21
"Wanted to check in very late. Could not reach front desk for 20 minutes trying the electronic options via phone. Failed, so went out of my way to check in earlier. At front desk, 3 separate travelers waited. One clerk dealt with us while another in full view (and whom I saw helping visitors later) kept working with computer. In room, the two lights near bed could not be turned off. I partly unscrewed both bulbs in order to sleep in darkness. Called that laggard's attention this; he looked at me without response. The lights problem lasted both nights I was there. Dining room personnel were nice.",2,Murray,2025-05-21

"I booked two Deluxe Queen Rooms for 4/25-4/29. When we checked in, both my friend and I gave ID and credit cards for our rooms. My friend was put into the incorrect room: it was a king-sized bedroom and she noticed the room TV had a different name (same first name, different spelling), but assumed it was a technical glitch and that she had been upgraded. The front desk called the room an hour later (after midnight, after a very long travel evening) to confirm the name on the reservation - and did not indicate why they were doing so.

On our last night, the key cards to that room deactivated, so she had to go to the front desk to get new keys. Both of the keys to my room barely functioned the entire time.

Before checking out, I realized I had pending charges on my card for both rooms - despite having given two different cards for the two different rooms at check in.

When we checked out, we communicated this to the front desk. They sent us updated folios and we realized at the airport that they had charged more for the second room, the folio for which still had the other person’s name AND last four of their credit card.

We waited for all pending charges to clear. My friend was charged for one night at the hotel, and I was charged for both rooms - AND hers had charges from the restaurant that she had not consented to (we assume they were made by the third, other person whose room she was put in).",2,Mary,2025-05-05

"The overall experience was good however there are few points they need to improve like room cleaning which is only done every 3 days and not well done, towels were dirty. The worst part was the service at the restaurant by Renee she was very rude and treated us very bad, we wait for more than 40 minutes for our breakfast and then she did wrong charges to our room bill, the same for 2 consecutive days. We complained about it and personnel at front desk just gave us a free cocktail in compensation. ",6,Ofelia,2025-04-18

"We had a friendly, courteous greeting at check in and out.

The room was very clean, and while not large, comfortable. If the bathroom was not just remodelled, it looked as if it had been.  The drapes my be getting a bit old, there are number of tiny holes one can see hen the sun shines on them.

This hotel has a comfortable lobby and restaurant area. Part of the reason I picked the Courtyard is because it said a restaurant and bar were in the hotel. 

Alas, on a Friday at 1010, the bar and restaurant were CLOSED. We were in town for a sports event and wanted to return to the hotel for adult beverages and/or dessert. (I don't drive at night and my spouse was not up to playing chauffer). I don't see why a hotel has a food and drink option that closes early on a weekend. Finding it closed took some fun out of the night.

Please folks, help me spent money at your establishment.

"Our stay for March 9-11was very nice. The room had an Excellent view of the mountains; the room type was called Mountain View. We were on the 7th floor. I would really have liked a larger fridge. At hotels these days, there's no reason to have such a small fridge. Whether we bring in leftovers from a dine in experience or we bring our own food, that fridge has little room to put things in. There was plenty of space on either side to put a better sized fridge. The door was unnecessarily hard to push with one hand, sort of heavy. They have a Starbucks down in the lobby, but it wasn't open often. I did not check the times, we checked out before 11am and it was closed, checkout is 12. The location of the hotel was excellent. We will probably use this hotel again, due to its location, more often. It was clean. I know there was a band or two staying there, because of the tour buses on the side of the hotel. They were not even noticed if it were not for the buses. The AC and heat worked very well. Shower was excellent.",10,Matthias,2025-03-12

Sofa was impossible to sit comfortably on. 
Property had a general air of being down-at-heel.

"We made a reservation via Expedia. Called the morning of check in and asked if we can do early check in . We were advised room was not ready . So, advised the hotel it will be a late check in .
Indeed , we checked closer to 11pm . The room type we reserved “was not available “, we were offered a “down grade “ . When asked for an upgrade we were told that those rooms are reserved for people who made reservations directly with Marriot . The most upsetting thing was  the response “because you made a reservation via a third party ( ie - Expedia ) and saved few dollars, we only upgrade reservations that were made directly with us”. 
At the end - we did get upgraded because we are member of the “Bon Voy “ with a high status .
Lesson - probably make reservations directly with hotel chain and not via third party . Just saying .

"The staff were kind and the hotel was in good condition. Unfortunately, I did not get very much sleep. My room was right next to the elevator and I could hear it running from my room despite playing white noise on my phone and putting a pillow over my head. I hear the staff say the hotel was full so I didn’t say anything the first night. The next morning I informed them of the issue and asked for a white noise machine or ear plugs and they informed me that they could move me to a different room at 1. I let them know I wouldn’t be back until the evening and they confirmed I’d still be able to switch rooms and that no action needed to be taken before them. I cleared out of the initial room and gave them my suitcase. When I returned that evening, I spoke with the front desk person, as previously instructed, and he informed me there were no open rooms. Apparently there was a communication failure as they never checked me out of the room and didn’t assign me the room that was open. I slept maybe 3 hours for two of my three nights here. I’m very disappointed with the communication issues and lack of sleep. After explaining this issue to the front desk person, they offered me free breakfast which was kind but not a solution to my problem or any sort of recognition of the hotel’s communication issues. I’d give 2 out of 5 stars but it was a clean hotel and staff were mostly friendly so I’m trying to be nice.",6,Dondre,2024-06-28

"Our stay was not enjoyable at all. I booked a ""non refundable"" suite 1 day in advance. When we arrived the staff at the front desk told us that they gave our room away.  We had 4 people (2 bed suite). Because they didn't have another room of that size, they put us in 2 different rooms. (one on a different floor). The next two days I tried to straighten things out with them and no one knew or could do anything. The 2 other people in our party chose to go to a different hotel altogether. It was clean and tidy, but the staff was completely incompetent on how to fix a mess-up.  ---Andy",2,Andrew,2024-06-17

I really enjoyed my stay at Courtyard by Marriott. The room was clean and dirt free.  I had a king size bed with a sofa bed sleeper and was spacious for one person.  The staff was also friendly and courteous.  I liked that they provided free water bottles as needed.  The only complaint that I would have is the thin walls.  My room was a conjoining room to another room and I can hear my neighbors talking and arguing at 6am in the morning. The location was also nice because it is walking distance to a lot of shops and restaurants.  ,10,Verified traveler,2024-06-11

The most frustrating thing about the hotel was the lack of service from the staff.  They were more concerned with conversing with each other than helping the guests.

The check in was great.  I was checked in quickly and the gentleman was very friendly and helpful.  I had a package delivered ahead of my arrival and the process to retrieve it was easy. This hotel was very clean.  The lobby was clean and welcoming.   The water with fresh fruit is a great addition and they changed the fruits up each day.   The pool and gym were both clean. The lobby bar is nice and the server Patty is great.  During your stay you should definitely eat at the hotel and have Patty serve you.  She is the most welcoming person I have come across in a hotel restaurant.   She makes you feel like a valued guest. The room was clean (except the coffee machine) and a perfect size.  I specifically asked for a room away from the elevator as I am a light sleeper. This is one of the few hotels that actually got it right.   So huge kudos to reservations for getting that right.  The one thing that I was not happy with was that they did not have free coffee in the lobby. There is a Starbucks in the lobby but the option for regular free coffee would be nice right next to the flavored water. Especially since the coffee maker in my room was not clean where the water goes.  ,10,Theresa,2024-02-07

"The staff mixed up several rooms and we’re not very nice about making it right… Although Jacob, Kevin and ryen were the best employees, and tried… I still felt they were a little slow to apologize and tried to fix the situation… One of the ladies upfront Milani she was terrible and argumentative… Otherwise, Jacob was excellent. He was the best. !  We had a family wedding there and they should’ve been very happy for all the business we gave them we had several family members who stayed there for a few days… We were trying to make it nice for the bride and groom who also stayed there… I really feel more could’ve been done rectify all the mistakes that were made, but unfortunately, they were very slow to do that. It’s too bad because we have other family members considering getting married in Denver and we would have recommended that hotel… Now we’re not sure so sure. ",6,Andrea,2023-10-29
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly:
The Good - the room didn't have bed bugs.
The Bad - I booked a King room with pull out couch and was given a much smaller Guest room with a Queen bed, not what I paid for.  I don't think I had a mattress to sleep on, I think it was two box springs on top of each other instead, horrible. We were there for 4 nights and only had the room turned over once, pathetic. Had to pay $12 to park a car for an unsecured and half empty parking lot, taking my money again. The breakfast choice was expensive, I paid $45 for two coffees, a bacon-egg-cheese sanwich on a hamburger bun, overpriced with no other choices within walking distance. 
The Ugly - asked for assitance from the Front Desk and Assistant GM and was told to contact Hotels.com because I booked through them, how convenient to not have to answer tough questions.",4,Stacey,2023-10-27

"Didn't like that we ordered rwo rum and cokes on single and one double only to end up with just coke/pepsi which ever they use. No difference in taste from single to double. They totally took advantage of out of towners. Didn't mind charging for a ""drink"" and not just a soda.
We were just trying to kill time with one drink while we waited for our ride. Thought we'd have a nice vacation drink to celebrate. Joke was on us. Be nice if you'd credit that money back along with  Patty or Peggy's tip.",6,Jorgine,2023-10-15

"We checked in on a Saturday, and I could see that the hotel had been very busy the night before.  When I checked into my room, right inside the door there was a huge hairball on the carpet.  That just signaled to me that at least, the room hadn't been properly vacuumed.  The room wasn't super dirty, but it could have been cleaner. For the amount of money I spend for 2 rooms for 3 nights, I am disappointed that the room wasn't as clean as it could have been.  I feel like the housekeepers just had too much to do before the next round of guests checked in and couldn't clean up to the level that I would have expected.  ",8,Shay,2023-10-09

"Hotels near and far to choose from in Denver. We were visiting family in the Cherry Creek area and have a kiddo who wanted an indoor pool to avoid the daily rain. Location and indoor pool reduced our options. We were happy with our room size and cleanliness. We did have unexpected parking charges of $12/day, not expensive but unexpected for our 3 night stay which would have been considered when choosing a place to stay. The well sought out pool was so cold it was unbearable. We tried the hot tub and the chlorine was so strong we didn’t last more than 5 minutes and our eyes were burning. The front staff were apologetic and stated they’d let maintenance know but we never utilized the pool again as that experience was ruined. Overall location was perfect for our needs, and room was nice. Pool conditions might have been a fluke but very disappointing nonetheless.",10,Jillian,2023-08-13

I was able to get my room due to help from family staying there, but there was incredible reluctance. I had even called ahead of time to confirm my reservation. In addition, I paid extra for breakfast ahead of time but they didn’t honor that request at all. I won’t be staying here again. ",2,Sarah,2023-07-17

"We booked our stay through Expedia for a king bed and double pull out sofa. The sofa bed was very misleading as it was smaller than a twin size and very thin with no support.  As we went back to change rooms as this was not what we booked, the hotel staff said they could not give us the room we booked and paid for as it was done through a third party. The staff confirmed they had the type of room we booked for a double pull out but would not do anything as it was through Expedia. They were able to switch our room to a twin size pull out but there was a very large tear exposing the inside of the couch. This hotel needs basic renovations. Our AC stopped working our last night in the hotel and would not go lower than 78. ",4,Kylie,2023-05-31

Trying to call the front desk to get more pillows (the pillows were rather small) took longer than I think it should have, had to wait about 5 minutes and was put on hold 4 times. But, the additional pillows arrived pretty quickly. The staff seemed very flat, not very friendly. Just doing their jobs...was a bit off-putting but we weren't staying long enough for it to matter too much... Mixed feelings about certain aspects of the hotel, but overall a fairly good stay.

The hotel itself was also very welcoming and clean. Perhaps too welcoming however, as it seems like I was unfortunate to be placed on a floor with teenagers running back and forth between rooms with no adults present and yelling and giggling throughout the night. While that is certainly frustrating I do remember the joys of being a kid in a hotel and choose to look past that part. My biggest complaint is that they tried opening the conjoining door between my room and theirs at about 1AM. It’s not often that I get placed in rooms like this and often forget it’s even a thing, but I wish it was something that hotels would disclose more often specially reasons like this.

"My family and I stayed here when we had some emergency work carried out on our home. As a short notice booking, the staff are very friendly and welcoming. In fact, Kevin from hotel management bought my young son some pool toys when  he saw how excited he was about the hotel pool. That’s something I will always remember. The location of the hotel is in central denver with easy access to I-25 and Colorado Blvd with neighborhoods like cherry creek close by for shopping and dining. Overall, I was delighted with the experience this hotel offered. ",10,David,2023-01-08

It was a great experience as usual. We stay here around 5 times a year. Its always a great experience. The hot tub and pool are definitely a plus if you have kids.,10,George,2023-01-03
"Stay was good. Lication great to hospital & restaurants, clean, friendly staff. Nice area for dining or watching football games. The only draw back was no free coffee in lobby or breakfast. Oh. And no vending machines - only snacks and drinks in area store for purchase where prices were ridiculous! ",8,Josephine,2023-01-02
