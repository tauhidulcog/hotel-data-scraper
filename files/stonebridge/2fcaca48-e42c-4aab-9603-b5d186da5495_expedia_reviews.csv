The room sheets were dirty and ripped . Had to get new ones and the blanket that they replaced it with all the cotton inside was balled up . It looked moldy . ,8,Nicholas,2025-10-03

"I booked a room with a double bed and a pullout sofa. There was no pullout sofa. There was a twin trundle bed, which is a small piece of foam on top of a pallet. Nothing that is appropriate for a human being to sleep on. I would never stay there again.",2,Susan,2025-09-25

"I booked The Baltic Hotel through Expedia and had a very disappointing experience. Upon check-in, I was given a room located directly behind the reception counter, which felt extremely uncomfortable and unsafe — especially since the room did not even have a lock on the door. When I went back to address this issue, the front desk staff member, Abir, was extremely unhelpful and refused to switch me to another room. He was also very rude in the way he spoke to me.

This experience made me feel unwelcome and unsafe, and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I hope Expedia reviews this property closely, as this is not the type of service or accommodation that should be offered through your platform.",2,Ibrahim,2025-09-23
"This is a very clean, well designed hotel! It feels like Brooklyn, it feels artistic and gives off positive energy!",10,Melinda,2025-09-17
The hotel itself is budget friendly and the bed was comfortable. The hotel is situated in a residential neighborhood that many lovely brownstone houses. The only issue is that there are some low income housing projects nearby and some strange people (I never feel comfortable around people wearing hoodies over their head) occasionally wandering around the area but there is a security guard at the front desk 24/7. The free bagels during breakfast hours were delicious. Do bring ear plugs because the other guests tend to slam doors in the middle of the night. ,8,Shengyi,2025-09-14
"Not bad if you just need a place to sleep for a night or two. The photos felt a little misleading though, the rooms are much smaller and a lot more tired when you see them in person. The walls were very thin and you could hear people coming and going, or smell the pot they were clearly smoking in their rooms. It wasn't dirty, but things were a little scuffed and dinged up. Looked modern and new, but like it had lived a pretty hard life already. The staff were helpful and friendly however, and despite some of the guests being a little noisy they were all also in high spirits and friendly - so it all felt very safe. Overall, as a budget stay - this was pretty good. It was clean and safe, and that's all that really matters.",6,Sofi,2025-09-09

"Had a water leak and they soaked my clothes and damaged some of my property - and didn’t do anything to compensate me. They didn’t even dry the clothes that were soaking wet and no solutions for me. In addition it smelled like smoke every night and the beds were uncomfortable and weren’t flat so whenever you moved, the bed frame rocked like an uneven table at a restaurant. ",2,Matthew,2025-07-10

"I understand that ""resort fees"" are a typical charge in NYC hotels.  However; this is not the type of hotel that should be charging them and on the third party vendor site - which is normally excellent at identifying this - it was not clearly indicated in the cost.  Cost was my primary reason for booking this hotel, so hidden additional fees are not ideal.  The hotel is perfectly fine and functional, I like the NYC themed decoration, but it is pretty isolated in location and I think staying on the ground floor rooms would be very noisy.",6,Verified traveler,2025-07-01
"Can't beat the price for the area and it'sjust a couple of blocks from two popular streets without being super noisy.

Noise will just be there for most older buildings without extra fancy glass and noise generators. Still, it's not such a popular street as to have cars and noise at all hours which is perfect. The rooms are all a little different in terms of size, but enough for two people to be able to sleep for up to a week or perfect for single person travel. No desk, no chair and just enough space to get dressed. All should be expected for the price.",10,Stacy,2025-06-28
"Rooms were extremely small however the staff was really nice. I didn’t like how I constantly got misinformation about the property and certain things that I inquired about (parking,dining, MTA service). Would I stay here again? Yes if there’s no other place to stay. ",6,Cinnamon,2025-06-25

"I have been staying in a variety of hotels in Brooklyn over the past year. All of them fit in the price range that this one sits in. This is by far and away the worst of that group. 
Bare concrete floors are supposed to be easy to clean, but you do still have to clean them. This place does not. I found dust bunnies of human hair in my room. The pictured “shelf” in the bath is a rusted and rickety steel plate and yes those scissors were there when I arrived. 

Not a good decision to stay here. Stay away until they change their practices. ",4,Chris,2025-06-20
,6,Sahaile,2025-06-19
"This place was honestly a dump, and not at all like the pictures. This was more like a hostel than a hotel. Lumpy mattress, ants running along the wall, and the smallest bathroom. We couldn't wait to leave.",2,Catharine,2025-06-17
"Cleanliness: Zero.
The bathroom had hair all over the shower wall, and there was a chewed gum on the nightstand.

The room was a decent size, but there were no glasses to drink water.

"Room was super small, no full length mirror, holes in the wall (room 206), power outlets inoperable, missing automatic door closer, white silicone caulk all over shower room, breakfast consisted of bagels and coffee.

"The Baltic is one of the few somewhat affordable options in this part of Brooklyn. The room was very basic, but reasonably clean. 10 min walk to subway and 10 min walk to Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens which is nice.

If you need a place to sleep and don't plan to spend much time in your room, this place is hard to beat on price in the area. If you are looking for any more than the basics, this is not the place for you.

The desk staff were friendly and efficient.

"I stayed here for one night before running the Brooklyn Half Marathon.  I was on the 4th floor and after having read some reviews that the walls were thin, I was delighted that the room was actually very quiet.  The room is small and minimalist but has everything I needed for a restful stay.  Bed was comfy and clean, AC worked great, the shower was perfect!  The staff was kind and even put out hot coffee extra early in the morning for all the runners.  They were also accommodating with late checkout in the morning.  ",8,Hannah,2025-05-18

"The room was awful. No room should be right next to the front desk or in the lobby. They put us in a room next to the front desk and lobby and you can hear everything. Every single conversation and people coming in and out of the building the walls are paper thin. We got a “two bed” room but really there was only a queen sized bed and a pull out couch. The bathroom sink is also really tiny and you can’t wash your face without water spilling all over the floor. I wouldn’t recommend booking here. They will charge you a $100 deposit that you get back after you leave. However, this wasn’t disclosed when I initially booked the hotel room. They also have snacks and water in lobby but you have to pay for it. $4   tax for a water bottle I could get at the nearby bodega for a dollar is robbery. Only good thing about this hotel is that it’s in a convenient location and only good for a 1-2 night stay. If you value your sleep, pick somewhere else to book a hotel room.",4,Selena,2024-11-20

"As a Brooklyn native, I can say that this place really reflects  the vibe of the good old days & definitely played a great part of making home feel like home.  Yes, for visitors the neighborhood could be a bit cleaner but that's not the hotel's fault.  I was greeted with a very warm hello and every staff member that I interacted with after that was great!

I slept so soundly - the blackout shades were fantastic and the hotel was extremely quiet. The bagels in the morning were as described - fresh and delicious.

I had to book a hotel last minute for nearly twice the price, plus an extra cab to get from this garbage box to the new hotel.  Lost an hour of sleep.  What a miserable experience.  If you're going to ""give away my room"" and not honor my reservation, perhaps just give me a courtesy call so that I don't also waste cab fare??",2,Evan,2024-06-12

This is a barebones hotel ok for a night and for one person. Was very hot in the room - virtually no temp control. No blanket just a sheet. No place to put things or sit and no carpet. Barebones but managed easily for one night. You won’t want to spend time in the room.,6,Aloshri,2024-05-23

"I really wanted to give this hotel the benefit of the doubt but there were just so many problems. 

The bathmat in our room was dirty. 
There was one washcloth and it had a hole in it. 
The faucet and the shampoo dispenser holder were both broken. 
The person who checked us in apparently wrote the wrong room number down and so our room was given to someone else. Huge security break. Luckily the guest was honorable and immediately told them. Nothing was missing. Apparently there was a ton of confusion about which room we were in but no one r thought to call my cell phone? Or text? We had received texts prior to check in, so I know that was possible. 
 
My credit card run through the day we were supposed to check in even though it was a pay when you stay property. It was declined (as I knew it would be) and my partner had put his card down when we checked in. I didn’t notice the accidental charge till the next day and it caused a lot of stress. 

There was an extra $24 amenity fee which included bagels and yep you guessed it, they were stale and dry. 

The staff were generally nice but not at all professional except the guy who checked us out. 
This is run like a bad hostel not a hotel. Considering it was only $50 less a night than the Aloft - which was much closer to the subway - it was really not worth the money we saved.

Honestly very disappointed. ",4,Natalie,2024-04-13

"Firstly, the staff is great here. Helpful & friendly, they are fantastic! But, look you get what you pay for here. The location is pretty far from anything. You have to walk about 7-10 min. to get to the subway. There's a few cute places within walking distance (highly recommend Anaïs & the other direction, Smith St Bagels).                                                          
But the hotel location could be a bit off-putting to some. Warehouses/work shops & a sketchy area right next to it at the corner. This area felt ok safe, but I wouldn't recommend it, unless you're city-savvy.                     Now the hotel room itself. Whew. Guys, can't you shell out a bit for a little storage? Or even hooks could help. There is nowhere to put your suitcase, thus clothes littered our room. Only 1 verrrry small hanger area on the opposite side of the bed. The sink is in the bedroom & is super small, no counter or area to store toiletries; everything kept falling on the floor. 
The shower is extreeemly small & not much water pressure. Bed was comfortable. The room was remarkably quiet.                                   
If you are looking for an inexpensive place to just sleep (you are going to be busy everyday) & you don't mind a bit of sketch & walking (more than you already do in NYC), then go for it. ",4,Dina,2023-11-01

"The staff was very friendly and was nice to accommodate us in a bigger room since we had a lot of luggage. However, our room’s AC wasn’t working and although we requested a fix it never was fixed. Our room was around 80 degrees throughout the night. It also seemed like they were running low on bath towels for each room. The bathrooms weren’t spotless clean but that’s why it’s a 3 star hotel I guess. The TV was very loud and the controller was broken as it didn’t allow us to lower the volume. The bolted lock wasn’t sufficient as it didn’t really lock our door.  This hotel is ok if you’re on a budget but can be inconvenient since the nearest subway is 15 min away walking distance and surrounding areas don’t seem to be the safest at night. Pastries/oatmeal and coffee for breakfast in the morning and free drinking water all day. Would suggest the hotel to reconsider their safety measures and ensure the comfort of their guests by fixing air conditioning. ",6,Ricardo,2023-10-28

"Let's start with the positives: The mattress exceeded our initial expectations, affording us a reasonably decent night's rest.

However, the aspects that left much to be desired were notable. Firstly, the location of the hotel was somewhat questionable. While I never felt unsafe, the immediate surroundings consisted predominantly of graffiti-clad warehouse doors, which left an unappealing impression.

The dimensions of the room were decidedly compact, and the choice of polished concrete for the flooring, while undoubtedly a trendy aesthetic choice, presented a slipping hazard. I experienced a near mishap while stepping out of the shower onto the slick surface, which, given the circumstances, could have resulted in a serious injury. The flooring seemed a accident waiting to happen. 

My initial concern emerged during check-in when a fellow guest inquired about the availability of toilet paper—a rarity in my hotel experiences. I have NEVER had to request toilet paper!  This strange situation became more apparent upon reaching our room and discovering only one towel in the minuscule bathroom. In a rush to prepare for a show, I was compelled to share this single wet towel with my partner.

When we approached the front desk for additional towels, we were shocked to learn that none were available. The hotel had recently severed ties with their laundry service provider and, astoundingly, had not yet secured a suitable replacement. While I do not own a hotel, I would imagine the smar",4,Fredric,2023-10-09
"Random building adapted to be a hotel. Lacking design, ambience, lobby, etc. Has what feels like an improv counter as reception. No gym, no standard hotel facilities at all. No ice on all floors, need to go to basement. 
Small rooms with under average furniture, no phone for front desk, tv didn’t work, no bed cover (just sheets), only one towel (laundry problems), sink is next to the bed because it doesn’t fit bathroom.

"First room we were given had no curtain or shade on the window, just a broken shade support. We complained about that, asking for a fix or a different room so we could sleep. Were told it couldn't be fixed and there were no more rooms/fully booked. Told front desk that they provided only one bath towel for two guests in the room; someone brought us a HAND towel and said, ""This will work really well."" Eventually we demanded a refund or a different room, and were given a different room, so they were actually not fully booked. Second room also had only one bath towel. The second room was poorly designed--could only access one side of the queen bed. To reach the other side, had to crouch down under the TV to get past it. Toilet seat had urine stains at the broken hinges. No towel rack next to the sink in main room. One rusty metal shelf in the room to hold a tissue box, but right at eye level--one of us got clocked by it twice during our two night stay. Only one bedside light worked, and you could only turn it on and off WITH the very bright LED across the room--so no ability to have a bedside reading light. Left an amazon Kindle in the bed accidentally. Tried for a week to contact them to see if it was there (a family member lives nearby and could pick it up). No response to messages and, for days, no one would pick up the phone when I called. Eventually got someone who couldn't find it, but who said the manager would call me.

I spoke to the front clerk, who had started her shift that morning, about the situation and she was very concerned and apologetic that this happened to guests. We hope whatever the issue was to create this situation, either computer error or human error, it’s rectified to not happen again to future guests.

There are safety problems in this area.  Not a good idea to walk to and from the hotel at night.  The hotel is not doing what it can to alleviate  the safety problems.  Entry to the hotel is unlocked at any time of the day and usually there is no-one at the front desk and no security of any kind.  Elevators are unlocked.  The room I was first given had a dead bolt that didn't work.  There are no safes in the room although several warnings are provided to guests including the need to ""secure your valuables.""  They are stingy on towels (my first room didn't have any at all) and while some nice individual products appear in the room (shampoo etc.) the bottles were empty. At several pints during my stay and in advance I was sent texts/emails inviting me to let them know if they could assist in any way or provide recommendations.  There is no-one monitoring or answering these communications so it was annoying to pretend to have these services when in fact they do not.  There is a lovely enclosed patio area behind the hotel that could be used or should at least be made to look inviting so the guests on that side of the hotel have a pleasant view.
