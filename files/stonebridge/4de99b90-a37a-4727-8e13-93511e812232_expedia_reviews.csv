"Loved the location of this hotel. Close to the water and restaurants. Although dated and a bit worn the hotel is spacious. My husband and I enjoyed the restaurant, especially happy hour and the roof top views. I used the indoor pool and hot top for some physical therapy.  It was great. ",8,Paula,2025-09-23

"This traditional, old-style hotel is quiet and safe. Depending on the room, there is a lake view. The hotel is within walking distance of the lake and very close to downtown. The staff is friendly.  The cafeteria was not open at 7 o’clock on Tuesday after Labor Day.",8,Tae-Hwa,2025-09-13

Location was excellent. Breakfast at Minerva’s was wonderful!,10,Laura,2025-09-03
"We paid 386 per night expecting great stay but far from it. Outside looks brick and solid but is deceiving. The inside looks so outdated from the 70s to borderline roadhouse motel quality. We arrived in the evening. The AC didn’t work properly was stuck on 62 turning to heat got up to 69, called the front desk multiple times no body answered and no one was at the front desk. The window also would not lock and was a safety issue. ",2,Ardit,2025-09-02
"Location is perfect with parking on site. Showers are a bit outdated and if you’re even 6 feet tall you have to crouch down because it’s very low. Everything else was great, will definitely be back ",8,Chaz,2025-09-01
"Disappointed by Security Oversight Despite Great Location
We recently stayed at the Park Place Hotel in Traverse City. While the hotel itself feels a bit dated, it was clean and the room—though small—was fine for simply resting after a day of exploring.
Unfortunately, our experience took a concerning turn. After a full day trip to Mackinac Island, we returned to our room on the second night to find the door wide open, held ajar by the security latch. It appeared that housekeeping had started cleaning but never finished—and most worryingly, they left the room unsecured with all our personal belongings inside. Anyone could have walked in.
We immediately notified the front desk, but all they did was take note of the issue. Upon checkout the next day, we received a simple “sorry,” but no real apology or effort to make things right.
We booked through Expedia and paid a bit less than the standard rate, but it was still far from cheap. We chose this hotel for its reputation and central location, expecting a secure and professional experience. Sadly, we left feeling that guest safety wasn’t a priority here.
We won’t be returning, and I wouldn’t recommend it to others who value peace of mind while traveling.",6,Ada,2025-09-01

"The primary reason for selecting the Park Place was its location.  While its 'off' the main areas of interest, its only a few minute walk to this area.  So for us, it was location.
   Overall, the stay was excellent.  The people we interacted with in the restaurant and the check in/out were friendly, quick to assist.
  Highly recommend this hotel if you prefer the freedom to walk to the main downtown area, or the Opera House or even over to the Hagerty Center (yes, both were on our agenda for events). Location was perfect for us.",10,RUSSELL,2025-08-30

"Pros- Nice central location , most everything in downtown TC is in walking distance, comfortable bed and clean room.

Cons - seemed understaffed and those who were present didn't seem to enjoy their jobs, you can tell it's an older hotel, several amenities either not functional (hot tub, Internet) or slightly off as to be noticeable/annoying (key card, toilet seat, closet door, elevator), expensive compared to other places in the area.",8,Mark,2025-08-29

It was right downtown and close to restaurants and shopping.,10,Kristen,2025-08-20
"The hotel was filthy.  From the foyer and newly replaced elevator flooring to the molded fruit in our room ice bucket, and management used the age of the building as an excuse.  The location of the hotel, rooftop bar and the front desk staff were the only positives to say.",2,Elizabeth,2025-08-20
"Not a very well taken care of property. Hot tub and kids water play area not working. The whole reason we booked this hotel was our kids were excited to use the pool facility. Water was very cold and most of the pool stuff didn’t work. Someone broke the estop button. Talked to front desk and they said “maintenance ordered a part and they are waiting for it”. That was day 1, we were here for 3 days and no one fixed it the whole time. Hotels location is the only thing it has going for it. Lots of other stuff broken or very old around hotel. I regret choosing this hotel. ",2,Eric,2025-08-19

"Overall, the Park Place Hotel was a nice hotel in a great location. We were greeted in a friendly and helpful manner upon check in, and were even given a room well before the 4:00 pm check in time. The hotel could use a little updating as far as carpet and cleanliness. The AC blew damp air into our room, but we had a nice stay and would return.",8,Alistair,2025-08-03

"The view from the rooftop was lovely, but we could not stay as we had our minor daughter with us. The hotel is well situated to dining, shopping and the beach. We loved that it was a very walkable neighbourhood. Our reservation was lost at check in, which was a little annoying as we had been driving all day and were a little exhausted, but it finally got straightened out. Also, most of the ice machines were broken, so it was quite the hunt to find the only working one by trial and error, since the information we were given from the front desk was not correct.",8,Lee,2025-07-21

"The rooms need to be updated and cleaned. Hair clogged the tub, I had to remove it, bathroom fan didn't work, beds were not the size indicated in the reservation, public restroom was a mess, and staff was not friendly. Location is great, walking distance from everything. But for the price the location is not worth the condition of the rooms. ",2,Tamara,2025-07-02
For $400.00 a night I was disappointed in the conditions. The hallway outside our room was carpet squares. I wouldn’t have a problem with that if they were squared up and without gaps. The desk chair in the room was missing a third of the leather. The wood trim was worn badly and scuffed. The staff however was excellent and very friendly. We decided to stay here because of the location. National Cherry Festival going on and we could walk to everything. ,6,Harold,2025-07-02
"The location of this hotel is excellent. So convenient for walking in the downtown area. The hotel itself is fine. Rooms were clean, but housekeeping was lacking, even after I mentioned it to the front desk. 
The lobby and common areas are good, but overall, it feels in need of a bit of TLC, especially for the price. ",8,Kristine,2025-07-01

"Check in was terrible, front desk person didn't acknowledge me for almost 5 minutes and I was the only one standing there (she was busy on a computer).  Housekeeping came but only delivered fresh towels, they did not pick up the room or make the bed.  Internet access was spotty at best... slow and non responsive for all three days of our visit.  We were also given a room that was not what I had requested when booking.",4,Kelly,2025-06-30

"Nice staff, old hotel, everything works. Looks like the decor and finishes haven’t been updated since the 1980’s but it’s all clean and in good condition. It’s like going back in time. Nice location close to Main Street. ",8,Linda,2025-06-27
"The pics and the choice of rooms is deceiving. We registered for a king bed room with a view but we were given an extremely small room with one small chair and no place to sit. For the price we should have received at least a room with some options to sit in the room. The HVAC was complicated and hard to figure out. First night it was freezing cold and the next day the air conditioner complete stopped. We ended up getting placed in a new room that was again small and not in the tower and with no view. 

Staff were really friendly but the hotel overall seemed in need of a remodel. The bathrooms were extremely small in our rooms and the overall place looked outdated feeling. 

The bar and restaurant were way overpriced for the food and drinks. $40 for a small portioned breakfast meal that would have been better seen at a Dennys. If this place is going to command a huge price for a room and food they need to up their game. 

Definitely advise people to look to other places or at least know what you are getting into before booking here. It’s not a luxury or near luxury experience. ",6,Fred,2025-06-26
"Room was great, hotel needs remodeling. AC went out first afternoon and they never fixed it. 2 days of 78 to 80° in our room. Hot and sweaty for the entire trip.",4,ROBBY,2025-06-25
"The location can’t be beat. Staff very friendly and helpful. Clean and comfortable beds. The hotel is nice just needs some serious TLC and updating. TVs, usb ports, carpets (esp the elevator) and you can never have too many hooks in the bathrooms! ",8,Lisa,2025-06-24

"You can tell this was once a grand spot. Now it’s got a very nice staff but the hotel is down in the heels. Doors, elevator, rooms all a bit ratty.

"The room was very clean and bed comfortable. The pool and hot tub area was newly renovated, bright and immaculate! The lobby and hallways could be cleaner and need updated, the hallways to guest rooms had stick on carpeting squares that would catch on luggage, housekeeping carts, and shoes, causing people to stumble.

The rooms were a little dated as the building, but for the age it was well maintained. There's a restaurant and cocktail bar on site and the staff is friendly and welcoming. But one stood out amongst the rest Aaron from day shift. Got us check in with a great room, helped us navigate the building, and informed us of the special events and items the hiyel had to offer.

"The great thing about this property is the location. This is why we chose it. It is very close to the water and also very close to downtown.

However, we had a bad experience with the condition and cleanliness of this property. The rooms are very old and neglected. Peeling wallpaper, stained carpeting and dents everywhere. Nothing like the pics we saw on the we site. 
We arrived to our room in the evening and when I opened the bed, I found small pieces of black dirt and a lot of hair. When we contacted the front desk, they moved us to a larger room with a view and gave us free breakfast, which we appreciated. 
The bed in the new room was clean, but there were cobwebs covering the entire windows and there was a lot of dust on top of the refrigerator and the microwave. We did not take the free breakfast because we worried about the cleanliness of the restaurant kitchen after what we saw!  I wish I could pist the pictures here!

Some towels had something yellow and crusted on them. The sink area was at knee level (this was not an ADA room). The elevator was very dirty.

"This was a profoundly disappointing stay.  Park Place USED TO BE the premier hotel in TC.  It has it slid straight to substandard in seemingly no time - yet they command top prices - not from me again.  We should have known as we drove up to dead or overgrown, unkempt landscaping - weeds and untrimmed plantings - it looks abandoned.  The evening staff was unwelcoming and largely disinterested in our presence; cleaning staff listening to personal music on cell phone - clashing with the music coming from the restaurant.  I know help is hard to come by but is that REALLY tolerated? in ANY hotel?  The lobby of the hotel is worn and tired, woodwork scuffed and beaten up - just everything tired and in need of replacement.  The elevator looked worse than most service elevators I have been in.  Hallway carpet coming up with squares overlapping - a trip hazard they will probably soon be paying for.  The room was fine but no great shakes.  Obvious scab-on electrical updates are substandard.  The bathroom was not very clean.  The bed was comfortable, though.  The restaurant was the shining exception - very pleasant staff and the food was fine and not ridiculously priced - but not enough to move the needle on this experience.  Overrated and overpriced for an unmaintained and undermanaged hole.  So sad.     ",2,Robert,2024-08-06

"The place is a scam. We paid almost 500 dollars a night, thinking that it’d be a decent place. The online pictures are severely photoshopped. The carpet looks like it hasn’t been cleaned for 20 years. Our room stinked so bad that everytime we enter, we had to open the window and turn on the AC to air for 10min, before it was bearable. You would think for a hotel of almost 500 dollars a night they would give you decent towels. No…. The towels were so thin and over-used that you can almost see through them. In all fairness, they have a decent swimming pool and the hotel is very walkable to all the stuff in the city, but other than that, all other aspects of the hotel were severely subpar. Terrible experience.  ",2,Verified traveler,2024-07-28

"Aesthetically beautiful hotel in a quaint Michigan town, this is an iconic building with a lot of charm and amazing  architecture  inside and out.  But there are three major issues with this place. First, the employees are not trained very well. The fellow at the front desk when we arrived  was not  charming or  helpful in  the least. Instead, he was dismissive and condescending. When we approached  him  about a problem with our bedding, he did not call housekeeping to have the sheets changed after we requested it. Simple act.  Unresolved for the guest. Hire people who represent your  brand better,  please. We  also had a room with a clogged sink that  would not drain that, when I approached the same gentleman with the issue,  as  I was checking out,  he  never apologized. Now,  there was a very kind and charming man at the desk later in the evening who was very helpful. But this other employee--who I dealt with originally--definitely  needs  more training in hotel management and customer service.  
While I find this hotel very  handsome, the place could use an updating. The  aforementioned sink was tiny. The rooms were on the small side. The grounds themselves (especially at the rear entrance) were embarrassing--overgrown with weeds, etc. Also, the in-house restaurant was less than impressive. For such a beautiful building, in a great location, you'd think the holding company would want this place to be extra special. Considering the nightly rate, my expectation was not met.",4,Terence,2024-07-17

"Positives: Location within Traverse City, and Guy at the front desk who did his best for us. 
Negatives: We checked in to room 220 in the west wing. The toilet was dirty and the room smelled really bad. The smell was probably due to old carpet and/or HVAC system. It was unbearable after one night (in addition to the bathroom not being cleaned before it our stay) so Guy set us up in room 605 in the tower. It looked like a nice room and had a beautiful view of the bay, but very quickly we saw clumps of hair on the bathroom wall and several strands of hair on the pillowcases and between the sheets. We notified the manager who appeared to understand the seriousness of our complaint and offered to ‘deep clean’ the room himself. When we got back from dinner our ‘deep cleaning’ resulted in the bed being made, but the hair was still between the sheets. Our next attempt to remedy this was to specify that the sheets must be changed which they finally did for us. 
Overall, this hotel has a great history and is in a great location, but that’s all. It is absolutely falling apart and not being cleaned or maintained like a hotel should be, especially a hotel that is over $400 a night. We had stained ceiling tiles in our bathroom, cobwebs in the bathroom, the mini fridge froze all of our food and drinks, fixtures have rust on them, I could go on and on… even the sign out front was faded and nasty. This hotel has serious management and cleaning issues. I will not be staying here again. ",4,Michael,2024-07-14

Nice hotel. A few minor things. Several carpet tiles on the 4th floor were loose and out of place.  The Wifi was not very good. I ended up using my hot spot for data whule we were there.  But location is very good and staff was friendly and helpful. We would stay there again.,10,John,2024-06-26
"The hotel has beautiful spots that make it a quaint location at the heart of Traverse City; however, on the 4th floor, there is much need for improvement. There are mismatched carpet slabs that create tripping hazards and show the tile underneath. There is a busted vending machine and a spot where an ice machine was once. Those typical hotel conveniences must be sought elsewhere. And all that aside, I would have given the hotel a better rating IF there had been ANY communication between the staff at the front desk. We were promised complimentary shuttles to the airport (as clearly stated on amenities) and even after giving flight details upon arrival, I still was told that I must arrange my own Lyft at my own expense when I arrived for the shuttle. So, if this is a selling point for you choosing The Park Place, save yourself the headache and go elsewhere. ",6,LaRaesha,2024-06-26

The layout was crowded and difficult to navigate. There was hair in the shower and on the floor upon arrival (not ours). They didn't clean the room at all during our 4 day/3 night stay. The employees were friendly. It seemed like they were understaffed, which may have been intentional because we arrived a few days before the busy season began.

Shower ok, hot water took awhile but stayed hot. Allows dogs is a plus. Our corner room with two views/windows was the best part. Not worth 400+ a night. ",6,Dee,2024-06-15
"The location was great as it was walking distance to many great restaurants and shops. However, we had a 4 night stay and our room was never serviced. We had to ask to get additional towels and toilet paper delivered. Both the pool and the hot tub were not operational and were actually not even filled with water. It appears they are experiencing severe staffing shortages.",6,Mark,2024-06-13

"We have stayed at this property approximately 5 times in the past. We were disappointed to learn that the pool and hot tub are currently closed. The website makes no mention of this, and it was not mentionedupon check-in. I later asked the front desk what the anticipated pool opening date would be and he had no idea. The pool is completely drained at the moment. We brought our swimsuits but never got to use them this trip. Our room was also not very clean upon check-in. We expect better from this hotel.

"First and foremost, it’s a superb location in the middle of the downtown area. The workers overall were nice, which mainly included the lady that checked us in and the restaurant waitresses. I didn’t have to pay a pet fee, which I really appreciated. Granted she’s really small, but that was still a nice gesture by the lady. The bed comfort was nothing to complain about, as we slept fine. Unfortunately, the pictures on the website doesn’t tell the story. It looks clean in the pictures, but it was pretty dirty once there. I feel like they need to do a major overhaul, such as new carpet, wall repairing, and lighting. I’m pretty sure the lady said they are in the middle of doing some renovations. It looks really dated and the elevators felt like it’s going to break any moment. The room we stayed in was a good size, except that the bathroom was tiny. The cleaning ladies were nice when we passed by and interacted with them when they saw my dog, but they only cleaned our room once the whole time we stayed. We stayed there four nights. Overall, it was good enough. Their main selling point is definitely the location and that’s why we booked there.",6,Jeffrey,2024-06-07

Room was clean but on the small side. Water pressure in the shower was poor. The white bath towels were light grey and were old. They should be replaced with new.

"At $450 per night, I decided to splurge because of other limited availability close to the downtown. I can't dismiss the great location. And frankly thought i would feel a bit pampered.Fortunately, this expensive room was for only one night. The room was incredibly tiny, and the bathroom was one of the smallest I've  seen. Barely large enough for one person, needing to close the door to sit on the toilet with a flush valve that needed 2 or more flushes to work. Toilet paper access requires body contortion, and the shower diverter is broken so water control must be done outside before stepping in. It has a safe, but requires payment to use. If the room rate was around $80 to $100, i would have expected those conditions. ",4,Jim,2024-05-20

Unfortunately we were so let down for our Christmas weekend away.. the whole time we were there our toilet was broken. They did not come to fix it after being told multiple times nor did they move us rooms. We had our room only cleaned ONE time after we had to ask for fresh towels. We were told it would be cleaned everyday. We saved and planned for this fun romantic weekend away and we were so disappointed. Upon check out I told the young gentlemen what happened with the toilet and our room never being cleaned. He gave us a $50 credit which to me was almost insulting but I didn’t expect anything to be honest after not having a toilet that worked. We will not recommend or stay at this hotel on our next trip. It was just so disappointing. The pool was very nice and the view from the hotel rooftop was nice but the drinks tasted terrible and were way too expensive. So so disappointing.. ,4,Katie,2023-12-25
"We had a great night's stay with a city view from the tower part of the hotel. Beautiful room, soft sheets, comfortable beds very clean bathroom! It was lovely to look at the lights during the night. The staff at check-in was fantastic, the staff we met in the hallways were very kind and polite. We did eat at Minerva's which was not that great. The staff was very good but the food was a bit sub-par especially for the price. My daughter ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli-the broccoli was old, covered in brown spots, the mashed potatoes were so over-seasoned with garlic she couldn't eat them (did not think that was possible-we are garlic lovers) and the salmon was not cooked all the way. They seemed to be out of all vegetarian options so I had a salad that was mostly red onion and my husband's chicken quesadilla was supposed to be shredded chicken and it was cubed with large slices of tomato in it. Just sharing because we want them to be successful seems like a rough night for them. The pool was fantastic, clean, and fun with a great hot tub and area for the kids. The pool water was warm and not freezing-really great! The towels at the pool were incredibly scratchy-we decided maybe they were exfoliating towels:)",8,Melinda,2023-12-18

It used to be such a lovely hotel and it is a shame that the current owners have let it deteriorate in so many ways.  The pillows, beds, curtains, shower curtains, and carpet need to be taken out and burned.  It didn't look like the elevator doors or buttons have been washed in years.  There is the smallest tv I have ever seen in the room and the remote would not work properly.  I should have read the reviews first but I assumed it was as great as it once was.  My bad.

For the money we paid for the room (400  per night) it was not worth it.  The room felt like being in a motel.  It needs some updating and tidying up.  There was some ashes or bug droppings on the window ledge inside when we opened the curtain and the trim work around the doors had been painted so much and were dinged up it looked awful.  The tiles in the bathroom are old and needs to feel clean and fresh.  It's not inviting. I know it's an old hotel but mgmt needs to keep it fresh and appealing if they want to charge this rate.

"Older place, dusty,  dirty a bit run down. No front desk help. If you need toothpaste or something you forgot, no remedy. Very much riding on its proximity to downtown, ease of parking and history. Sad to see how far it’s fallen. ",8,Eugenie,2023-07-25
"We have stayed at Park Place Hotel in Traverse City previously because of it’s location and walkability in downtown. We had a great experience in the past and expected the same experience this trip. We previously ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant and also visited the hotel bar at the end of our day and both were wonderful, however, this visit we arrived in Traverse City in the morning. We did park at the hotel and walked to a restaurant and had lunch (convenience). We spent more time going to the stores and walking the area. We wanted to freshen up so we could continue with our plans, which we had to postpone until we got into our room!  Check in time is 4:00 pm BUT when we returned to check in our room was NOT ready!!  We paid over $440 for this room. I asked WHY?  She stated that they are short staffed and didn’t know when it would be ready! I asked her to call me when ready. NO CALL yet at 5:00 pm!! I called again and had to leave voice mail!  In spite of not being able to freshen up, we visited a couple breweries and at 6:30 I called AGAIN and spoke to a male and he, at that time asked housekeeping and they said “5 more minutes”! Unbelievable! We had to abandoned some of our plans due to time, and returned, AGAIN, to check in. We got into our room and headed out to get dinner!! By the time we got back, we were all exhausted! In morningwe checked out and asked for credit on our bill due to all of the above and was denied. Nonsincere apology! We will NOT stay here again",4,Patricia,2023-07-24
"Great location. Pool was brand new and nice. 

Hotel is understaffed. We had to wait in the lobby for over an hour (almost 6 PM) to check in. We watched multiple other guests check in while we waited. The room was old and outdated. Definitely, felt like we over paid. ",6,Kate A,2023-07-23

"If not for Dennis at the front desk the rating would have been much lower. First room we were provided had a non working toilet, shower, or a/c unit. While Dennis did his best to move us to a new room it was Not until the evening of the 2nd day of our 3 day trip. Roof top bar is small, and in need of a complete renovation and have the ability of serving draft beer. Housekeeping is poor. Pool area is great,",6,Edward J,2023-07-22
The hotel was very convenient to the shops and restaurants.  ,8,Julie,2023-07-21
I liked the front desk. They were helpful and informative. Hotel was quiet and lots of parking. It was easy to get to downtown stores and to the beach. I wish the bed was a little softer but the location and view made up for this . ,10,Christina,2023-07-21
"It’s a great location to be able to walk around the city, but the picture is deceiving because it’s not as close to the water as it appears to be in their advertising. When we arrived, our room wasn’t ready, and the staff wasn’t very accommodating about it either. We weren’t upset. We remained calm, but a few of the staff members we encountered still had an attitude while interacting with us upon checking in and again at checkout.  The room was ok. Clean, but the second bed was 6 inches from the bathroom door.  That’s a bit off putting. ",6,Joseph,2023-07-20
Room service was advertised and it was not available. Instead the hotel put out a paltry “continental” breakfast. Walls and doors dirty. Wouldn’t stay here again. ,6,Anna-Rae,2023-07-19

"Had a great time at the Park Place Hotel. The room was spacious, clean and had an amazing view of the bay / city. The staff was also incredibly nice and helpful, 10/10 recommend! ",10,Austin,2023-07-18
"Rooms are dated, dirty and extremely small (particularly the bathrooms).  The beds were very uncomfortable, the pillows were lumpy and smaller than many airline pillows.  Only 1 person works in the lobby and that person has to do everything from taking phone reservations, to calling housekeeping so it always took forever to do anything. Housekeeping only comes when requested and when I requested it they only half-heatedly made the bed and didn’t even change the towels or wipe down countertops.  Supposedly there’s an airport shuttle but when I asked about it they said it wasn’t available for sn early flight.  I would never stay here again.  Worst part? It was hideously expensive for what it was. ",4,Mereke,2023-07-18

We arrived to our room to find food in one bed in the sheets and blood on pillow cars and comforter. The pillow had biological stains. The desk chair was terribly worn pleather. The patio set on balcony was at least 20 years old or that’s how it appeared. The shower curtain smelled moldy. The electrical plug in the bathroom did not work and neither did the one next to the bed. The pool and lobby area were nice. The ice machine on our floor also did not work. Too bad it was so disappointing since it’s in a great location in downtown Traverse City. ,4,Stacy,2023-06-04

Easy check in and right in town.  Able to walk or bike to so many places.  This property is pet friendly however Expedia apparently doesn’t do a good job letting the hotel know you have a pet.  It is an additional $20 a night and they keep you in the West wing.  Just FYI. ,10,Tamela,2023-05-27

First time. The room was very nice and had a great view even from only the 4th floor. The grounds of the hotel could use a spruce up. The front walk was crumbling and uneven and potentially a little unsafe. We waited at the front desk for a bit before being helped at check-in. The location was great - we walked to bars and restaurants easily.,8,Jason,2023-05-12

Very disappointing. Check in was 4 and we were not able to check in until 6. No rooms available until then. When calling you have to leave a message for the front desk. You don’t get a return call. We stayed in the rooms that had a balcony and they are pretty outdated. The toilet is so low it was almost hard to sit. The convenience to downtown was great. Liked being able to walk downtown. It would be nicer if it was updated. ,4,Verified traveler,2023-05-01

"What a great location! Close to so many restaurants and bars, there seems to be no end! Keep in mind, this is an older hotel so it’s going to take a couple minutes for hot water in the shower, but it has the fastest elevator in the world so there’s no waiting so that makes up for it. The walls must be 2 feet thick because I didn’t hear one thing except a door close once in two days. 
Would highly recommend if you’re looking for the Traverse City, downtown experience!!!",8,Roger,2023-04-03

Located in the center of Traverse City downtown with easy access to all the restaurants and shops within short walking distances. The hotel is old and has no restaurant. Room is clean.

"Check in was slow.  Only one person at the desk for check in and 4 people in front of us and 3 behind us.  The attendant at the desk told us there was a limit of one vehicle per room.  Nowhere in any of my reservation paperwork did it say there was a limit and we told her we were from two different areas.  She said okay it should be fine and nothing ever came of that.  Our room was fine.  There appeared to be an attempt of updating the room, but the work done was very sloppy.  It needed painting and some of the old lighting was still there, which was odd.  The comforter had stains on it, but we bring our own bedding so not a big deal for us.  We could change the temperature in the room easily, but the fan in the bathroom didn’t work.  The hot tub and pool area was open til 10:30p and the area was kept clean.  Was great at night after walking around in the cold.  The mattresses in the rooms were not horrible.  It was an okay stay and I would go again.  ",8,Meghan,2023-02-28

"We drove down to Traverse City to do some ring shopping and figured we'd stay at the Park Place Hotel since we had a great experience the last time a couple years prior.  

We realized after we had booked the room, that there was a cornhole tournament happening the same weekend.  When it came time to check-in, we attempted to find a parking spot in the hotel parking lot and there were a few cars/trucks taking up more than one spot.  As I was waiting in line to check-in at the front desk, others were experiencing the same issues, which I commented on why there were not any spots.  The gentleman (I think his name is Guy?) behind the desk checking people in was extremely understandable about this and said he would reach out to maintenance to see what they could do to free up some spaces.  We were provided with parking accommodations which went above and beyond in our opinion.  The professionalism and service is what will bring us back to stay here again in the future.  

Our room was in the historic tower and had no issues with hearing others in the hallway, a musty smell or the elevator going up/down.  Everything was very clean and the bed was super comfortable as well.  

The rooftop bar is another reason we enjoy staying at the Park Place.  The bartender was absolutely amazing, as well as the other staff there, and they made the night very memorable.

The Park Place Hotel is within walking distance to many places and we love that convenience.",10,Angela,2023-02-26

"Front desk was friendly & fast with check-in. The room was nice with a beautiful view. We did find dried toothpaste on the counter top in the bathroom & I am unsure what was on the mirror on the bathroom door. They did provide 2 packs of wipes so was easy enough to wipe up those things. The fridge in the room was very cold (plus). The bed was firm & comfortable. The hot water took around 6-7 minutes to reach the shower but, I figure it's many floors up. Once it was heated up was great! We had an app & some drinks on the property at Minerva's. The bartenders Matt & Bryan were so much fun! Would stay here again.",8,Jason,2023-02-18
"The Park Place was a great place to stay!  They were considerably understaffed at check in.  Check in was at 4 pm, we arrived at 5pm and couldn't get into our room until 7pm.  They were apologetic and comped us drinks at the bar until we could get into our room. ",10,Jeffrey,2023-02-06

My daughter has severe allergies and was very sick in the morning and had to go to urgent care. Also, the Hot tub wasn't working. No room service and the front desk man, Guy, was cold and unhelpful. Didn't even ask if we enjoyed our stay. Likely because he knew it was subpar. For voer 200 a night, I expected to at least not sleep in a room that smelled like wet dog.",4,Cheryl,2023-01-29

I was initially woken between 2:30-3:00am by other patrons returning to their rooms. The walls are so thin I could hear their conversations. At roughly 5:30am I was woken again by the horrific sound of a squeaky fan motor. I played with thermostat to try to get the sound to stop. It would stop for a bit but start again when I fell back to sleep. I am exhausted and it will no doubt impact my presentation today.
