The staff were very friendly and there were plenty of shops with a massive food hall right across the street. A lovely park across the street as well. Overall a wonderful experience. ,10,Brooks,2025-10-06

"My check-in experience with Aloft was horrible. I will never stay there again. They did not have a room for me, even though I made the reservation well over a month ago. I don’t have enough space to describe everything that happened. They finally transferred me to the Sheraton next-door where they were very helpful and efficient. I will see you there again, but I will be reviewing Aloft and advising people never to stay there.",2,Sara,2025-09-29

"I stayed here with my sons and stepdaughter for one night prior to a cruise and for a night post cruise. It was very clean and comfortable and in a convenient location. All parties were happy. My adult son commented that although there was not shuttle to the cruise terminal, that the Uber was quick convenient and affordable as compared to my parents who stayed on a hotel with a cruise terminal shuttle that was twice the price and not quite as nice. We would definitely consider this location for future travels. ",10,Carolyne,2025-09-28

It’s 3 mins walk to the closest subway. Lots of shopping around the building. The staff at the front desk were always friendly and helpful. Good use of space. It’s a tall order in busy Newyork but aloft does a decent job in delivering great accommodation.  ,10,Oluwatobi,2025-09-22

"I tried to reach the hotel by phone because my flight was delayed to no avail so I send a text message that went unanswered. When I arrived at 4am next morning I found out that my reservation was cancelled. So I had to wait, finally getting to my room at 5am. The lobby at that time wasn’t welcoming, people drinking with a bottle of black label at the table, and other trash at other table. However, after that first impression everything went well and I enjoyed my stay.",8,Carlos,2025-09-06

"Aloft is a solid choice for me when I’m travelling for work/leisure and looking for something I know will be clean and affordable. This location has a rooftop bar so if your room is in the higher floors you will hear it in the hallway, luckily not in your room though. ",6,Justin,2025-07-28
"
Staff was good, pleasant and friendly. 
The compliments stop there.

The hotel still list and shows pictures of a swimming pool although it was sold years ago. Isn’t that false advertising?
AC didn’t work, coffee maker didn’t work, 
Cheap bedding, floor was cracked, broken.
Elevator loud creaky heard every up and down.

"This was my second time staying at the Aloft. First time was great, this time we had NO HOT WATER for two of the four days we were supposed to stay. The last night we asked to be move to another hotel. And I was in a party of nine, and we all asked to be moved. 
I was told that I would get an 25% discount for one night, yet to see that reflect on my credit card.
I know mechanical issues comes up, but in this situation the guests shouldn’t have to pay twice for it. 
Thanks for listening.

Gwendolyn Jones",4,Gwendolyn,2025-06-03
"There was no hot water on days 2-4 of a four day stay. The reason for this was unclear, maybe it was an issue with a nearby construction site, maybe the boiler, maybe both. The clerks at the desk were clearly tired of the complaints. On day three, we were told that showers were available in the hotel next door.

The overhead light in our room could only be turned on by calling the front desk, they would send someone up with a ladder, he would climb up above the bed headboard and turn the lite on! Fortunately there were two windows that let in ample lite during the day, so this was only necessary once a day. 

Hotel location is convenient to restaurants, subway, Target and Barclays.

Loved that it was close to the train but also walkable to so much! Some guests were loud next door due to thinner walls but honestly it wasn’t the end of the world. We could get access to extra towels as needed and the room had just enough of the essentials. Next time I’ll get to access the gym and the rooftop next door to report more on those.

"We like the convenience of the Aloft when we're visiting our kids in Brooklyn. They live at Grand Army Plaza and it's a short subway ride away. We like being near the food court in the shopping center across the street where there are many choices of types of food plusTrader Joe's and Katz's Deli. The rooms are well designed. They have everything one needs including plenty of places to stash things. However, I left my heated brush and they were unable to locate it even though I called the next day and provided them with the room number and had left a tip for the maids.",8,Susan G,2025-03-15

"the decor was something out of a 2010 frat dorm fever dream, but the room was extremely affordable with easy subway access. Whatever smell they have blasting in the lobby is THICC. The rooms were decently sized, but we barely spent time in them. On a Saturday night around 1 AM, we feared we were being too loud drinking and playing music in our room… stepped into the hall to hear the whole floor bumping music and partying. SO, the stay was perfect for a group of late 20s- early 30s friends looking for a good deal with central location, but if you are not in that demographic, I might look elsewhere. Perfect for our purposes! Though the elevator took 10 minutes to get to floor 20 at times, that was the worst part! We also had trouble getting the terrible shades in the room to open and close! But free coffee & water in the lobby, and very helpful staff. They waived our early checkin fee for Marriott Bonvoy members! ",8,Kirstie,2025-03-01

"This hotel was a solid three stars in my book. You get what you pay for, and I think it was a great deal considering the price. 

The pros were it was a cool looking hotel, the room was clean and it wasn't too loud. 

I think the biggest downside was the service. I called to get an extra blanket and the first time I called I waited half an hour and it never came. I called again and it came 45 minutes later, I was already asleep. 

In the morning they put coffee out which is great, but no milk or cream. I asked for milk and the guy asked the kitchen, got his answer and just sat back down and didn't tell me no. I thought that was kind of rude. He did seem very tired, it was early in the morning. Not a huge deal. 

I would stay again, like I said, a good deal for what it is. Definitely felt safe! ",6,ashley,2025-02-10

"I may list some cons but for the price in regards to the accommodation was very good and i will most likely rebook. 
Pros: Location was great. No issues with the hotel and staff was awesome. Subway was around the corner. It was also a decent walk to the brooklyn bridge. Different food options were nearby. Definitely Value for your money!

Cons: Listing was inaccurate for breakfast that they didn't have and some parts of the hotel needs some touch up. Parking instructions were unclear.

Again, with that price. It is still good and of value. The pros outway the few cons. Will rebook again probably in the future if the rate does not go up dramatically",10,Michael Ginno,2025-01-31

Close to several subway stops.  Even walkable to Manhattan taking the scenic Brooklyn bridge.  Affordable lunches across the street at the much revered Trader Joe's.  ; ). Parking very expensive at $55USD/night however and could not park in front of the hotel to unload the car as there was no space on the street.  But good stay overall.,8,Laura,2025-01-13

"Wow what was unique? I guess it was the rave happening a floor or 2 above us that went on until 2:30 am. Have you ever tried to sleep during a rave? It sucks.
Perhaps if the gentleman at the desk had just been a tad more forthcoming  when he asked if we wanted a quiet room... do people ever ask for a noisy room? We were on the 22th floor- I have no idea how many floors in total but did not have a rave on my bingo card to be going on from 6 or so until 2:30 am.The room itself was fine - nothing memorable either way although there were no hand rails in the bathroom-aren't all bathrooms in hotels required to have hand rails now? And has the designer of the shower ever been forced to actually use it? There is no way to start the shower without a full blast of cold water as you move the handle to hot. It is not designed well. 
But the location of the hotel is good. As long as you don't try to sleep in the room, the next guest should be fine. Very disappointing for the money spent. You really need to decide if you want to be a hotel or a nightclub.",6,Jan,2024-12-30

The room was great. I have stayed in a lot of hotel rooms but this was one of the better ones. Very impressed by the level of cleanliness. The room was a decent size for a new york hotel. The parking would have been $65 for the night but there was plenty of street parking as long as you pay attention to the signs. Overall I had a great stay. And the price for one night was unbeatable.

Im a native New Yorker that recently moved to NJ so i occasionally stay in the city.  This hotel was clean however relatively small and the hallways and rooms slightly run down.   The front desk employees were helpful when not busy.  The only thing is even though the area is mostly gentrified at night there are alot bums and homeless people that can make the area unsafe at night.  Other than that its a good hotel.",8,Samantha,2024-11-11

"Everything worked great; I liked the layout of the room.  It's New York so everything is tiny, but the layout maximized the space in the room so we had room to sit and it didn't feel like we were in a cave.  The finishings showed a bit of wear and tear - the room could probably use a new paint job and some new fixtures, but the original design was clearly upscale and kool.  The area has a lot of amenities and is walkable. ",10,Bao Chau,2024-11-11

"Stay was comfortable, location was awesome and the rooms were reasonably spacious for downtown Brooklyn.
Chris who checked us in was great.

After we left is when the problem started. On arrival, we were charged our stay plus an additional fee for incidentals. When we left, we were charged again for our stay, without the incidentals, but the pending transaction for the original fee wasn't removed, so on the hotel system, and according to our bank, we were effectively charged twice for our stay, plus incidentals.
On contacting the hotel we were told there was nothing they could do about it, and it would be refunded within about 5 business days. After 7, we contacted our bank, who gave us an authorization code for the hotel to manually release the funds. I gave this info to Aloft, & Daniel Lam responded to say he could not help. After 2 emails saying he couldn't do anything about it, he just ignored my correspondence. We were forced to escalate with Marriott Bonvoy who made a case and our money was released within 3 days.
So basically, Aloft did nothing until forced through their parent company. So appauling customer service, and completely ruined what had been a great trip.",4,Troy,2024-11-10
"Would have been a great stay if the hotel didn’t have roaches. I killed about 6 before I got my room changed. So, more than likely I won’t be staying there. The building had a D rating but I assume since it’s ALoft, that may be a mistake but it’s still New York so you can never be too sure. Overrall location was perfect, walkable, plenty food option just didn’t like the option of roaches in my room. I’m pretty sure the staff is aware of it on the top floors. So if you stay here, don’t stay on the high floors, stay on the lower levels like floor 1-12. I’m just saying. Hope you guys get that fix. ",4,DORRELL M,2024-11-08

"I would just have liked to have a gluten free breakfast with my teen daughter who has celiac disease and cant eat gluten or dairy. The front desk person didnt have any idea where we could go. This was Brooklyn! Im sure there had to be some breakfast place. Why couldnt the purple Rainbow restaurant next door have had GF breakfasts? We ended up going across the street to Trader Joes to grab something...which ended up unintentionally having dairy in it (sour cream in the GF muffins). As happens too often, my daughter had to get by on gluten free crackers until we got home to CT in time for lunch.

It was nice to have complimentary chilled water and coffee in the lobby.  It would be really nice if the water, especially, were available ALL day, morning AND  evening.

The stay was okay. A little run down. Showers were too much water and leaked all over the floors. Getting ice was inconvenient as you had to ask the front desk and they would take your bucket to the back room to get it. Hallways were hot as hell. When we walked into the room it was clean but the window was open…beds were comfortable and liked that you could log into your streaming services. All in all give it a 3 out of 5. Definitely a lower end Marriott. But it served its purpose. The bartender was extremely nice and drinks were great! ,8,Sara,2024-08-21

First two nights there were fire alarms without any announcement that they were unintentional/unnecessary. Third night we had a brawl outside our room with someone thrown against our door and and class thrown and broken outside our door. We warned the front desk and later got to speak with the police. Last two nights were without incident thus a two out of five score.,4,Paul,2024-07-15

"This is the second time I stay at the Aloft in Brooklyn, and both times I’ve been with family.
The best part about staying here is its location; you’re really close to subway stations, bus stops, and it’s really easy to get to Manhattan if that’s in your plans. Additionally, there are a lot of food options nearby, as well as shopping options. Room size was appropriate/comfortable, and it was pretty clean. Only deducting a star because the hotel in general is starting to show some “wear” and it needs a bit more maintenance, and because last year, they used to have like a “snack” happy hour and they don’t have that anymore. Having said that, I recommend it.",8,Verified traveler,2024-07-12

We had a great 1 week stay at aloft brooklyn. Location wise it was really good. Directly opposite dekalb market and a few minutes from the station. This station is only 2 stops from manhattan financial district. We have stayed in brooklyn before and had scouted out the better areas to stay. There is loads of great food options close by as youd expect in new york and also a good shopping district is 1 block away. The room was a decent size and very clean and comfortable. The shower was good. Lifts were quick and always working. Reception was nice and had a pool table and a bar and the staff were all really helpful.,10,Phillip,2024-05-20
The hotel is a quick walk from multiple subway stations making getting around Brooklyn or over to Manhattan very convenient. Located a block away is shopping including Target and Trader Joe’s.

"I recently stayed at the Aloft Hotel in Brooklyn and overall had a pleasant experience. The room, while small, was clean and well-maintained, providing a comfortable space for my stay. Although the walls were a bit thin and I could hear my neighbors at times, using white noise helped me sleep peacefully.

The hotel had a great vibe and was clearly well-kept, contributing to a positive atmosphere throughout my stay. However, I did notice that some of the front-end staff could benefit from additional training. While some employees were friendly and attentive, others seemed overly focused on their computer screens and lacked a welcoming demeanor. I believe this is an easy fix and could greatly enhance the overall guest experience.

Despite this minor issue, I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again in the future. The positives of cleanliness, maintenance, and overall ambiance outweighed any drawbacks, and I left with a generally positive impression of my time at the Aloft Hotel in Brooklyn.",8,Lance,2024-04-25

"My review has two parts: 1) a general review and 2) a review specific to my experience. 

1) Generally, this hotel barely meets the bare minimum. You step into the reception area and the vibes are bad. There's a strange little bar, a pool table, a small breakfast area, and a couch and a few chairs (where a (homeless?) man with a Whole Foods bag was *always* sitting while staring blankly and the staff seemed okay with it... bizarre).  The rooms are austere with little decor, and the decor that's there looks like it would fit in a prison. In sum, it's a pretty bad hotel. 

2) My personal experience: we'd booked a three-day stay in a king room. We show up and there are no king rooms available, so we get put in a double and are told we can move to a king the following day and to leave our luggage with the front desk in the morning (also got a $10 discount for our troubles). Ok, not great, but fine. The next day, we bring our luggage down to the front desk and ask if our king room will be ready by 3pm. We're told yes, easily, but when we return at 3pm, the room isn't ready. Ok, we're starting to get irritated, but we ask if 5pm will work and we're assured yes. We return at 5pm and the room is ready, but when the front desk staff brings our bags out, it's clear someone has opened my partner's bag. We point this out to the front desk staff and they shrug their shoulders. I'd stored her laptop in my suitcase because the hotel didn't feel particularly safe, and I'm so glad I did.

I arrived at 3:30 and there were no rooms available due to cleaning staff delays, concierge couldn’t give me an actual time of when the room would be ready and ended up waiting until 4pm for a room.

"By far one of my favorite hotels I've stayed at while visiting New York. The room is quite tight but the hotel made the most of their layout. It is modern and includes a fridge. The beds were extremely comfy and I slept well every night! I got to explore Brooklyn since this hotel is conveniently located near many different metro stops with lots of stores for shopping and even an amazing food hall with many yummy options! Manhattan is only a 20-minute metro ride away. I felt safe at this hotel and there is a deli conveniently across the street for a classic bacon egg and cheese. The staff was always very attentive and housekeeping would come daily which was very appreciated! Unlike other NY hotels, there are 4 elevators that work pretty fast. It would occasionally get crowded but I enjoyed how I wouldn't ever have to wait too long to go up to my room/down the lobby. I would certainly stay here again. ",10,Samantha,2024-01-09

The place is beautiful. It was one of the most comfortable and cleanest bed I've slept on in a hotel, and i travel quite often. The staffs were very nice and generous, both at the hotel and when making reservations.
The only bad experience is that there was a window in my room that was unable to close and sealed properly. The handle was broken,  so i couldn't turn it to lock and seal it shut. Being on the 20th floor, and a very windy night,  it was impossible to get any sleep that night. I mentioned it to the front deck, wich they did fixed the handle, but was still unable to lock and sealed the window shut. Needless to say i had to be up at 4am to catch a flight, and another night with very little sleep.",8,Frederick Richardson,2023-12-24

"Wir wurden am Anfang herzlich Begrüßt und hatten auch ein gutes Gefühl, das Zimmer war größer als gedacht.

Aber beim Duschen waren wir dann enttäuscht. Man konnte Temperatur und Wasserdruck nicht separat steueren. Hat man mehr Wasserdruck gewollt und man hat aufgedreht, dann hat man sich am heißen Wasser verbrennen können. Somit hat man den Wasserdruck gesenkt um dann eine angenehme Temperatur zu erreichen und mit langen Haaren tut man sich mit diesen Umständen schwer.
Außerdem hatten wir dann zwei Tage keine Zimmerreinigung an sich kein Problem wenn man das von Anfang an weiß, aber unser Müll ist übergequollen. Als wir dann am Empfang gefragt haben, ob es im Hotel normal ist, dass nicht täglich geputzt wird hieß es ""es würde nur alle paar Tage aufgeräumt"". 
Doch für uns hat sich das dann als Ausrede entpuppt, da ab dem nächsten Tag täglich die Zimmerreinigung da war. ",6,Daniel Roland,2023-12-06

He said they have no room for us to move into and we should just bare with this room until morning. He promissed us a discounted rate. We spent the night as we had no choice. The tv was also broken and dispite his effort he could not fix it. The next day we talke to maanger and she promised us a discount which is yet to come after 3 weeks.

"$4.50 for a cup of cereal, yes, a cup. The individual cups. Sure, inflation is real but that’s highway robbery. Moving on- it takes forever to check in or out. There was always a line when I was there to speak to front desk. Short staffed or slow service? Not sure. The hotel itself was clean enough. The rooms are actually on the larger side, the Bathroom toiletries are nice. The shampoo and conditioner 10/10. Otherwise - the old loud A/C made it hard to sleep and the room felt very out dated, and odd? Will not stay here again. It wasn’t horrible but wasn’t good. Decent stay. Slow service. Slow staff.

My reservation was prepaid however when I got there I was told the hotel was overbooked. They had to put me in another hotel the first night. In addition no one was available to assist with valet when I got there and there was no where to park and wait for someone to come as the hotel is on a narrow one way street and there was no street parking available.  I had to leave and come back later that night because I was running late for an event so I didn't get to drop my luggage off or change for the event. I also had to pay $70 for valet which I did not know the cost at the time and no one told me that there was hotel parking available at a cheaper rate. The room was comfortable but I will not return because of the lack of attention given to me as a guest. ,6,Robyn,2023-09-07

"Book at your own risk.  Having been at several other Aloft properties, I had an expectation of service and how my stay would go.  I was wrong.  The staff is nice enough but the operations need improvement and the hotels needs to be renovated.  My room didn’t come with an ice bucket so I was given a plastic bag with ice.  The television in the room didn’t work.  The walls in the bathroom are painted so you see blue paint running down from where wet towels and water have hit them.  Since the rooms are so small (expected in Brooklyn), you could hear most of what was going on in rooms from the hallway.

"Hotel was very clean and quiet. Room was perfect for our two night stay and was comfortable. The only issue I had was the valet parking . Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and was asked if we wanted valet parking . upon checking in we just dropped off our bags in the room . We were not in the room for more than 30 minutes. It took us longer to get the car back and valet was $65 dollars ! Beware there is no sign , or notice of how much fee is. ",8,Peter,2023-07-14

"I have had family and friends stay at this Aloft for years—and have done so myself. I will never give them another dime after my most recent hellish experience. 

I requested a room on a higher floor away from the elevator. I was given on on the second floor facing a construction site and right by the elevator. The noise from the site and street came right through the non-functioning AC unit. 

When I came in after dinner I couldn’t get the AC to work. They told me to try the unit itself vs the thermostat. Weird but fine. The unit is under a desk and hard to access. I hit my head trying and it wouldn’t turn on. It was boiling hot and loud. They wouldn’t give me a new room saying they were booked. 

I was miserable all night. Oh and then the metal bathroom door handle fell off and landed on my foot. What a nightmare. I’m still trying to get my money refunded as this is offensive to pay such a fee for such shoddy treatment. Beware!",2,Kristy,2023-06-21

"They overbooked so instead of getting our two full sized beds, they gave us a handicap accessible suite with a king size and pull out mattress. 

It was great having the extra space, however the hotel itself was poorly maintained. The shower head was broken so half of the water came out of the hose. And the bathroom door only had a handle on the outside of the sliding door so someone else had to close and open it for you (reminder that this is supposed to be handicap accessible).

The staff were extremely nice but seemed to all be new. When checking in, the one desk member had difficulty with someone’s request and went back and forth to their back office until they finally brought out their supervisor to assist. This created a decent line and wait but they were very apologetic and kind. We also had a spill in our hotel and when we asked for anything like paper towels to clean it up, the overnight member couldn’t find anything and gave us two toilet paper rolls and extra laundry bags. And it took a few requests to finally get extra bedding and towels for our pull out mattress. ",4,Catherine,2023-05-15

I hate to leave a not fully satisfied review because the staff was nice and the room was always clean and comfy but the noise coming from the rooftop restaurant and bar was just too much. I was on the 21st floor and the lounge is on the 24th but I could still hear the music thumping through the wall and chatter noise from the restaurant through the hallway. I called the front desk every day but they could not move me. The club closes Fr & Sat at 3 am so I had a hard time falling asleep. I was in NY to work and needed to wake up early so it was really an issue. If you are on a floor further down or out to party as well and come back late this might not be an issue for you. ,6,Boris,2023-05-05

"It was a decent hotel for the price but did not have many amenities. The biggest inconvenience for me was that there was no microwave available in the room or lounge area downstairs. I felt uncomfortable having to ask the staff to heat my food up in their back office. I don't imagine installing a communal microwave in the lobby would be too complicated or costly of a task. The staff were pretty laid back but helpful when I need assistance. There were some issues related to water in my room. Notably, water leaked through one of the windows when it rained and the bathroom sink did not drain properly. Overall, it was a fine experience but I do feel I would have gotten a better value if I spent $20-$30 dollars to stay at a hotel with more amenities. ",6,Jasmine,2023-05-02

I’m Asthmatic, informed the front desk and was told there’s nothing that can be done until they get a repair person here. After waiting over an hour after the fire department couldn’t resolve issue, another employee walked us over to another hotel took us up on the Sheraton’s hotel elevator  to the 25th floor had us walk across bldg to our hotel, Aloft, and said to walk down to my room floor.

"The other reviews were definitely harsh. The only ""issue"" was that the mobile key was unavailable and the lower bar was being renovated. I'm not sure if the rooftop was ever open...They could use some resistance on the doors because they slam hard if you let it. I did have an initial sheet issue but they were very quick and responsive to room requests. 

The room was clean, decent view and food in the area was great plus its downtown Brooklyn so plenty to shop if necessary. They'll microwave food at the front desk if you need as well as hold bags if you have to check out but still wanna hang in the city before the flight out. 

Definitely an affordable stay that I'd consider again.",8,Faith,2023-04-15

The counters in my room & parts of my bed sheets were dirty upon arrival. They placed me in an adjoining room with a door that locked but the walls were paper thin & the guests next door were loud until 4am & had a dog constantly barking. There was massive construction going on across the street making it impossible to sleep in. The window to the room did not properly close which carried in a draft & noise constantly. I placed a “Do Not Disturb” sign on my door but still had room service loudly banging on my door in the mornings. ,6,Victoria,2023-03-29

"We drove 7 hours to arrive with no greeting parking was not on site or included and we finally get to our room with no means to accommodate pur luggage to get settled to have a broken toilet, no working phone to communicate with the front desk. Around 1030 pm we were moved to another room to settle in finally close to midnight to have no tv, working wifi and a terrible room. Go back down to the fd cause no one would answer the phone to find a new employee more concerned with his friends then helping us at all telling us were stuck so puck either the broken room or the one with no tv or wifi. After a terrible night we wake up to find out their offered and advertised breakfast unfortunately is not being provided at this time not to mention it was dirty, flies all around the hotel and my white socks were black from walking around the room. It was terrible we ended our 2 night stay a night early and paid the extra to stay at the holiday inn. I am still trying to get my money back and was charged for the 2 nights even after all this and checking out early. Not happy at all. Oh and their discounted parking they offer cost us 108.00 to park our vehicle in a parking garage in NYC for the 2 nights.
