Everyone was very nice!,10,Daman,2025-10-06
All good,10,Sharon,2025-10-06
I honestly can’t complain about this place. For the price it was a great stay. They met all my needs and I the staff were very attentive and helpful. ,10,Denise,2025-10-06
"Breakfast was nice. I wish a coffeemaker or microwave were in the room. Its nice to relax with a hot coffee or hot tea after unpacking or around bedtime. By the time you fix it in the lobby and return to room its cold. Also not going to lobby in bedclothes! Staff ok, but a little condescending when i needed assistance with tech on checkin.",6,Susan,2025-10-04
I had to ask about sheets for the sofa bed and I was informed that I would have to go down to the lobby to get my sheets.  Then I had to make my own bed. The nice lady said that was not her job to bring the sheets up to me.  Was a little disappointed at that. ,6,Tamra,2025-10-03
"Staff were friendly and helpful,  coffee is available in the lobby 24 hours, close to parking options for the airport, and beds were comfy.",10,Amy,2025-10-03
"Friendly staff, clean room, convenient location.  Shuttle to airport was flawless.  Driver was great.  Price was right.  Would stay again.",10,Derek,2025-10-02
Staff was helpful. Charged twice for parking- should not be charged AT all for overnight stay. Abundance of spaces . ,8,Kathryn,2025-10-02
"Ok, so The bird crap on the patio was a little disappointing. But my real complaint is they subcontract out the parking, which is just a pain in the ass to have to register and pay outside of the room payment. It was extremely aggravating after traveling for 10 hours. And then they had the nerve to call me in my room to say the shuttle was leaving if I wasn’t down in 3 minutes when the clock in the room said I had 15 minutes. Front desk attendant told me that we’re not responsible for setting the correct time on the room clocks! Then, at 12:30 AM, I called for a shuttle back and was told I’d have to wait until 1:30 AM because the shuttle just left and could not turn around to pick me up. It turns out they subcontracted the shuttle out as well, and driver told me he has 5 hotels to take care of. This place is far from Hilton standards, I recommend finding somewhere else to stay. ",6,Scott,2025-10-02
"We booked this hotel to save a little before an early morning flight, but it ended up being disappointing. The stay came with extra charges for parking, and the room itself had moths and ants. Unfortunately, this is not a place we would choose again.",4,Stephanie,2025-10-01
Breakfast was basics cold and hot cereal. Rooms were clean. ,8,Isaiah,2025-10-01

Nice stay,10,Irasema,2025-09-29
"I did not stay. I could not get there because of a delayed flight and resulting missed connection. I asked for a refund. You refused, because I could only provide about 20 hours’ notice - not 24, because I did not know in time. Horrible, disappointing, greedy behavior. I did not cancel, because why would I? So you could be paid twice? I will not use you again. ",2,Kirk,2025-09-28
"The room and breakfast were fine.  My complaint is that I didn't like being nickel and dimed for parking.  If you want to charge for parking, roll it into the room rate and compete with the other nearby hotels on an apples-to-apples basis.",6,Michael,2025-09-28
"My room was fabulous, and the staff was very helpful and considerate",10,Robert,2025-09-27
"Paying for parking after I just paid close to $200 for a room was disconcerting. $10? Really?  Oh, and the breakfast at Spark hotels SUCKS. If I knew it was just toast your own bagels I would have went back to Drury. A hot breakfast is a real treat when traveling. Room was satisfactory. ",6,Michael,2025-09-27
"Room was clean but sparsely furnished.  No coffee maker, no chair only a stool, no microwave.  Beds were comfortable.  Had to pay for parking, which was surprising for an area with lots of open space around it.  Minimal parking out front with limited access to the building from the back lot.  No back entrance and no signage as to where the entrance was.  The side entrance I found in the dark only had stairs.  Staff was mixed, some friendly some not depending in the shift. Breakfast had a good amount of cold items (eggs were cold hard boiled) with a toaster available.  Heavy on carbs but had the eggs and yogurt for protein.  So very basic hotel that was clean, but would pick a different airport hotel next time.",6,Deborah,2025-09-27
"One would expect a first-class experience in a hotel with the name Hilton on the wall, but this is their attempt to cheapen up the product and increase profit based on brand recognition. First thing in the door is they will charge you $10 extra to park there, although it is a rural setting where space is not a premium. Then they seal coat half the parking lot but don't limit reservations, so there is no parking available. The room is quite nice and reasonably quiet unless you are near the elevator, which scrapes the floor and vibrates your bed every time it opens and closes 24/7. But at least, you suppose, the breakfast will be great in the morning? Cold cereal, toast and hard boiled eggs - more like a Days Inn at twice the price. Won't be staying there again.",6,Michael,2025-09-26
"This hotel has absolutely no insulation apparently because you hear everything in the hall, parking lot, next door. I was woken up hourly by someone talking or running through the hall. People should also know you have to pay for parking and try do not even give a bottle of water in the room. Would never stay here again!",4,Nicole,2025-09-26

"Clean room. Friendly staff. Air conditioned room. Hot shower. Breakfast was mid, but can’t complain; the coffee, bagel, and oatmeal got the job done. Didn’t like that I had to pay $11 to park the car outside. Enjoyed how close to the airport the hotel was. ",10,Daniel,2025-09-23
"Okay airport hotel, but sheets for the sofa bed were not clean.",6,Scott,2025-09-22
This is about as basic as basic can get but still updated. But good value go the money. ,6,Vanessa,2025-09-22
,10,Melody,2025-09-20
"I am not sure how this happened and it may not be Sparks problem but I arrived at 2:30 in the morning to be told I did not have a room.  The desk person said they overbooked and we didn’t have a room even though we reserved one. We didn’t know you have to pay through Expedia to “lock-in” the room.  Since we didn’t pay Expedia, our room was given to someone else. 

I’m in another city with my wife after traveling all night and now don’t have a room. Had to go 30 miles north to get a room. ",2,Jesus,2025-09-20

"The surprise fee to park on the property I think is crap. Why would parking be an additional charge? Clerk at desk tells me the parking is managed by someone else.  I don't really care... I paid for a room and assume it includes parking. Especially when I am parking on the same property the building is on. Overall the facility is real nice and the room was great.  Parking fee, not so much.",8,Steven,2025-09-14

"Super clean, quiet, and right near the airport. There's tons of dining options nearby as well as gas stations for you to cap off your rental car. We were glad to take a chance on this new line of hotels, and we'll do it again next time!",10,Lindsey,2025-09-08

They charge you to park.  It wasn’t added to our bill. The lady at the desk said “ just scan the QR code on the counter and pay.”  I had to create an account in order to pay for parking.  I don’t think I should have to pay to park. It was one night.  It was not a park n fly. It was very inconvenient to have to create an account and pay that way. If you want to charge for parking why not just add it to the bill. The room was nice  but they only left us one washcloth.  The breakfast was so-so.  Didn’t have milk for the cereal. Had to go ask for it and then was told it was by the cereal but it wasn’t.  ,8,David,2025-09-03

Hotel was perfect for a short stay to explore Denver. Eating options nearby and a 35 minute flat walk to the Denver transit system (61st & Pena station). Hotel was clean and functional. Good breakfast. Aircon system is very noisy. Overall a great stay. ,8,Susan Joan,2025-08-31

"The room had obviously just been upgraded, which was nice but it did have a slight smell, we think from the glue or the A/C. It wasn’t a major issue though.

Staff were friendly, room was clean, shower was hot. Exactly what you need from an airport hotel.",8,Dave,2025-08-29

"The AC was so loud we had to out a suitcase on top of it to keep it from vibrating and keeping us awake. 

The toilet is loose and moves when you sit on it. 

Parking in a basic lot is an extra fee and you can only pay through an app. You have to log onto hotel paid internet to access the paid parking app. 

No Microwave in the room. ",2,Claire,2025-08-19

Stayed because we had to.  Unexpected flight cancellation.  We were able to book a room and the front desk staff was nice considering how busy it was.   Rooms were so bare bone that even basic amenities like coffee pot not provided.  Room had a sofa bed but no sheets/blankets/pillows for it.  Had to wait an hour to get it and be able to make the bed.  Just overall not a comfortable stay ,6,Verified traveler,2025-07-21

"The noisiest hotel I’ve stayed in for a long time. The floor shook when you flushed the toilet, you could hear every movement (literally) in the adjoining rooms (to each side plus above), each tap use created a huge hissing noise (both our room and the neighbours).
Breakfast was all full of sugar, all plates & cutlery were single use, no recycling effort was made.  The fact that there was limited breakfast choice was ok, but what was offered was all ultra-processed and devoid of fibre. The only things fresh were some wrapped fruit, but no vegetables. They do offer gluten-free bagels, which is good. 
Price was ok, but other chains do it much better for the same money. Won’t be returning. ",4,Michael,2025-04-09

"Newer hotel at good price and with good amenities but they should have investing more in soundproofing. Having an illness that makes sleep a challenge, I booked a top floor room. I reconfirmed by phone 4 hours before check in. When checking in I was told all those rooms were gone.    She was mad at me for suggesting it.  Too tired to protest, I went to bed only to be wakened my the cacophony over my head.

Great water pressure, plenty of hot water, and eco-friendly ""supplies"". Bed was also comfy and the linens were comfy.

Cheap $$, but paper thin walls. Heard every door slam around me which made sleep hard at weird times with early flight.
That said, customer service was thoughtful and I appreciated it. Room was very spacious, very clean.
Overall it was loud to me but I’m sensitive. Also right in takeoff path for planes so that’s a loud too. Literally at the airport so that’s what’s you’d expect 
I’d probably stay somewhere else next time to ensure good rest and quiet. Good remodel but walls and floors are very thin, so the noise was a deal breaker for my rest ",6,Sherri,2025-02-17

"“Breakfast” was bagels, packaged muffins, Yoplait Light, gross orange juice. The coffee was abysmal. There is a sign informing guests they can buy better breakfast at the front desk 😆

We were greeted when we checked in with “Can I see your ID please?” No hello, no smile, nothing.

There are no coffee making options in the room nor is there a microwave. The coffee in the lobby was cold in the evening and plain awful in the morning.

All this being said, the room was clean and comfortable. And it was very cheap so I guess you get what you pay for. I think they should not say they have “breakfast” since it was just carbs with very little protein offered. They also need to serve decent coffee and juice. 

I’d be fine staying there again because I know the score now and would bring my own breakfast and coffee things. 

Staff also needs to behave like they’re not miserable. I didn’t see anyone working there who looked as if they were OK, never mind happy. Makes you wonder. ",6,Katherine,2024-11-24
