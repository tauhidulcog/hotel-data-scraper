"We were very happy with the hotel. There were some renovations going on, but nothing affecting our satisfaction with our stay. We will definitely be returning.",10,Velma,2025-09-29
Hampton Inn at Oak Hill is our go-to hotel when we visit nearby family in Austin.  The road construction can be a challenge initially but hopefully won't last too much longer.  Facilities clean and everything seems to be good working order!,8,Claudia,2025-09-29

Staff friendly. Easy access to highway and shopping centers within a mile. Good breakfast too,8,Timothy,2025-09-16

"On a positive note, the cleanliness of the hotel and in the daily room service was excellent.  However, Of 3 front desk staff, only one had any customer service skills. Front desk girl during day - had an incredibly blunt affect and appeared to be somewhat sullen and zero personality.  Upon registering on my first day, after encountering her, I seriously thought about switching hotels. She was no better on day 2. A girl that worked in the evening had great customer service skills. A gentleman that worked in evening and overnights was less than helpful when I had a problem with the business center computer.  Within span of 45 minutes, called desk  3 x.  No answer.  Went down and desk was empty - he was sitting at a table in the dining area talking to a female.   Tried to use business center - computer down.  Went to gentleman at table - he told me what might work (never getting up) and I tried again.  Told same gentleman - he went to reset router. Returned.  Computer still down with zero offer of a solution. I said I‚Äôm making a speech tomorrow (Saturday) and was there an office I could use for 15 minutes.  Absolutely not which is insane.  What hotel doesn‚Äôt have at least one office with a computer and printer? It was still not working when I checked out on Sunday. TV was a problem but didn‚Äôt complain. Received a note on day 2 indicating tv was going to replaced so clearly this was known to mgt prior to my check in) Construction noise was constant until 7 pm/730.  Don‚Äôt recomme",6,theresa,2025-08-24

Overall this seemed like it would have been a great stay if not for a couple of issues. There was remodeling being done all day into the early evening which made it impossible to rest during the day due to the constant banging and other noises. We had to rotate between our second floor and first floor room on a rotating sleep schedule. My family ended up leaving more tired than we arrived.,6,Darius,2025-07-31

"Was not a very good stay. Went because I had to come down to Austin for school and thank goodness someone came with to be in the room when I got back because my room key NEVER worked. They ‚Äúre-programmed‚Äù the key three times and gave us new keys daily‚Ä¶ There was also water all over the floor when I came back, buckets everywhere in the entrance from leaking sprinklers. This place was a wreck. Never staying again. ",2,Alayna,2025-06-07

"The stay overall was great! Everything was clean and super comfortable and the staff was super friendly. There was plenty of well-lit parking. Loved the pool! My only complaint would be the breakfast. It was okay. We have stayed at several Hamptons, and the breakfast at the others was phenomenal. They had cheese omelets, breakfast sausage, bacon, eggs, and just lots of options. This one had a couple, but mostly like a continental breakfast. ",10,Jennifer,2025-05-30

Went back to front desk and the lady there acted put out and mumbled an irritated sorry while blaming ‚Äúthe system.‚Äù  Next day when I came back to my room the key card didn‚Äôt work. Again the same lady at the front desk acted irritated. When I reminded her that this was my second issue, she gave me attitude and said she was already in trouble for the day before and an apology should be enough. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve had service this rude and on two different days with the same lady. ",2,James,2025-03-08

"Check-in was quick & efficient.  Rooms are spotlessly clean. The king size bed was very comfortable.  All staff members were polite and professional.  Free continental breakfast is a quick, easy, and convenient offering.  The make-it/yourself waffles were especially popular with all ages of hotel guests.  Coffee is good, juice and milk is available, cereal, eggs, etc.  
I recommend this hotel for anyone that is looking for an economical and comfortable hotel.  
NOTE: there is a lot of freeway/road work in this area with entrances (and exits) temporarily closed and/or relocated to other parts of many businesses.  With an updated GPS navigation system or app we had very little difficulty finding and accessing the different places we went to over a 3-day weekend. ",10,Paulette,2023-10-16

Do to the large amounts of construction around the hotel is very difficult and unsafe to leave or enter from the main road. Forcing to either risk it waiting extended periods of time for traffic to let up. Or to go through a round about way to enter the main road,6,jacob kegan,2023-10-08

Breakfast sucks,6,Steven,2023-10-01
Breakfast was good. Staff is friendly. Bed and pillows need work. Not comfortable. Had to kill bugs multiple times daily in our room. On the floor and on the walls. In the bathroom and bed area. Also had to try to sleep hearing crickets. So I suggest not staying on the First floor. That may have been the issue because family we travelled with didn‚Äôt have bugs on the 3rd floor. ,6,Roxanne,2023-09-26

"The front desk guy, Larry, who checked us in was wonderful.  He was friendly and able to chit-chat while he was clicking computer buttons for the check-in process.  He was warm and attentive.   
In our room, the shower head was broken and it could not alternate from the main head to the handheld piece.  As a result, the pressure was limited to both.  That was not great, but everything else is the room was fine

"Inconveniently located near highway 290, the exit is easy to miss, and they're building a new overpass running right over the property. I initially chose it due to its proximity to Dripping Springs, where I was attending a wedding, but wish that I'd chosen something more centrally located in retrospect. Everything else was fine for my stay. I would worry about highway noise once they finish the overpass.",8,Brian,2023-09-05

Booked this room for my elderly sister who‚Äôs a/c had gone out in 100  temps. Her landlord couldn‚Äôt get it worked on until the next day. The hotel staff went out of their way to help her. They were all so nice! She loved her stay at the Hampton Inn Oak Hill. She said the bed was wonderful! She really liked the breakfast choices too. ,10,Shirley,2023-08-20

"This will be extremely straightforward, but it was a really solid place. I think in terms of value, location, and just needing a place to crash for the night. It was absolutely perfect. I would definitely come back. I‚Äôm not going to say it is insanely fantastic or over the top but I would argue that hotels. Don‚Äôt necessarily have to be that. The price range was absolutely perfect for me and my girlfriend while we explored the Barton Creek area. 
Breakfast was just as advertised and really good. 
Gym was decent. I wish there were more options for workout machines but the dumbbells where of good use. 

The room itself was clean and expected for the price range. 

If I‚Äôm ever in the area again I‚Äôd come back and stay. ",10,seth,2023-07-11

Clean and quiet. Friendly staff. Breakfast sausage and scrambled eggs were different in taste. Didnt care for them. Waffles were good.  Construction in front made it a pain to get to when coming from Austin. Tons of traffic. ,10,Doug,2023-06-25

"Very clean insude and outside. Only dislike was all of the road construction in front of the hotel, which the hotel could do nothing about. Once we figured out the in and out it was tolerable.  Good central location for our visit to surrounding areas.  Staff was all very pleasant.  Breakfast was typical and adequate.  The biggest negative I saw during my stay was someone had there pet in there arms while serving themselves breakfast.  I had already served myself otgerwise I would not have eaten that day as the dog was held very near the food, plates and utinsels.  Just not right! I would definately stay there again. üôÇ",8,Kenneth,2023-05-01

"They hold not allow me to check in due to power outage and because they were told that the power would not be on until after checkout the next day. They promised to issue a refund when I was unable to check in. Now they have charged me for the stay and they are refusing to refund it, even though they would not allow me to check in.

"Random stranger knocked on my door at 4:30am in the morning saying that they worked for the hotel which I believe to be a lie. I did not feel safe and secure also the construction around the property is a mess and making the hotel extremely loud when trying to go to sleep. The staff are very unprofessional when I call to report the incident they act like they didn‚Äôt even care about the situation
Still waiting on a call from the manager do not recommend staying here. avoid at all costs

They had their own credit card thank God, but the man at the desk was confused because I had ‚Äúalready checked in‚Äù. Otherwise wonderful hotel! ",10,Ruth,2023-01-01
