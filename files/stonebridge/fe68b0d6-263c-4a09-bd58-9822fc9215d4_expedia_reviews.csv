"Super clean, I could smell that they had shampooed they carpeting recently (not an offensive smell). Being physically disabled, I felt safe traveling there with my young elementary aged son. The room was huge and comfortable. We enjoyed the pool and spa tub that were so super clean. I would definitely stay here again without a second thought.

"I stayed at a competitive hotel earlier in the week, and so when we walked into this Hilton, I was very struck by the difference. The staff is so nice and professional, the room is huge and the finishes are just so much nicer. 
The pool was clean, the bathroom is beautiful. I will never again not spend the extra $50 to stay at a Hilton. ",10,Mary,2025-08-17

"Stayed 2 nights for a friends' get-away weekend, mostly in the hotel just for changing/sleeping. Easy check-in, room was ready a bit early as requested. Clean spacious room, comfortable mattress and pillows. Would have appreciated a little more lighting though, all lamps were small and room was dim after sunset even with lights on. Was really nice to have water bottle-filling station in the lobby---nice touch on a hot weekend!",10,Verified traveler,2025-07-23

"Nice property. While the restaurant is ok.  I think it would be better if not doing breakfast and instead having a continental breakfast included. The quality of the food doesn't match the cost,  and $15 voucher (2 adults only, kids not included) didn't cover coffee and a breakfast. Would rather have it included and be able to pick my own food.

Room was big and comfortable.  Great Amenities for the facility and room.  Easy check in and friendly customer service.  The only thing that was unpleasant was that we were issued a connecting room without notice and the sound reduction could be worked on.  We could easily hear the guests in the next room and their barking dog woke us up in the middle of the night and morning.,8,Jose,2025-02-17

Hotel was beautiful but the restaurant didn’t have a chef working one of the nights and room service for breakfast took almost 2 hours.

We booked a 1 bedroom suite for our family trip during spring break.  When we arrived we found out that our 1 bedroom suite was not available and would not be during our 2 night stay.  We were very disappointed as our family was looking forward to the extra space and bedroom since we have a 1 year old.  I am not sure if this was truly a maintenance issue or if it was overbooked and priority went to a Hilton member.  Either way we were very disappointed.  ,4,Albert,2024-04-09

The facilities and the hotel were very clean and comfortable. Only small issues we came across is the hotel was too warm in the rooms. Unable to cool the room past 73 degrees. So very hard to sleep. They did move us to a different room in which was a little cooler but still remained at 70. ,8,Carl,2024-01-02
This is our go to hotel when we’re in the area and our previous stays have been great. This most recent stay was not as expected. The room was hot and humid. We tried to turn the AC on and lowered the heat but the lowest temperature available is 68. We spoke to the front desk and they said their engineer would fix the temperature of the room for us but the problem wasn’t fixed. The room was nice but it’s hard to get comfortable in a room that felt like a sauna.,6,April,2023-12-30
