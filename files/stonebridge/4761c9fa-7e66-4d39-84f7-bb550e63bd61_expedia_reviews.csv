"It is a normal business style hotel.  Friendly staff.  If you drive, expect to pay for parking, and the valet staff are possibly the friendliest I've ever seen.  They will take care of you and your car.",10,Joseph,2025-07-07
The restaurant food was mediocre. The wine prices were outrageous for the brands.  And the cr√®me br√ªl√©e was the worst i e ever experienced.  The chef needs to be taught how to make it.  I was told by the server that this is the way the chef likes to make it and then mentioned that many people don't like it.  She waived the charge.,8,holly,2025-07-07
"The staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating.  An additional bonus is the restaurant, it was actually the best food we had while in Denver! Hats off to the new Chef!",10,Mindi,2025-06-29

"This is a lovely hotel.  The lobby and features of the old bank building and it's original artwork are very unique.  This large space presents as warm and welcoming and the staff further adds to that feeling.  
The room was immaculate, beds were comfortable, no outside, downtown noise penetrated.
Highly recommend",10,Susanne,2025-03-30

"Let me start by saying the staff here is top notch. Everyone from the front desk concierge to the bartender were so friendly and welcoming. 

The main complaints are small, but noteworthy- 
The tv remote in our room barely worked, which was fine, we made it work. At 10:45AM someone knocked on our door and let themselves in (assuming room service, though we had our do not disturb sign out). We let them know we were here and they left. The back of the door at the hotel says check out is at 12, however when you book they say 11.. either way, someone was letting themselves in before 11. We called the front desk and they told us check out is 11, and we explained it says 12 on the door so we will do our best to be out by 11. They were very kind about this, and extended our check out to 12, though it did leave a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. 


Overall our experience and stay was wonderful, however for what you pay for a room and for a 4 star hotel, I think a few things could‚Äôve been better. 

That said- the espresso martini by Josh (I believe, the gentleman working the night is 2/14), 10000/10!! ",6,Shannon,2025-02-15

They did not give the room I booked and only gave one bed when we requested two. They stated that they don‚Äôt honor bookings through Expedia and it is essentially first come first serve. We then asked for an extra roll-away bed but they said they had given them out already and there were no more left. Terrible experience. ,2,Nickveer,2025-02-06

"Excelentes instalaciones y el mejor servicio en recepci√≥n, sin embargo varias de las habitaciones ten√≠an un olor muy desagradable a ca√±er√≠a. Ten√≠amos 5 habitaciones en mi grupo, y 3 de ellas ol√≠an muy mal.
Adem√°s, tampoco hay caja de seguridad en las habitaciones, y algunos objetos desaparecieron (al reportarlo nos dijeron que supuestamente house-keeping no hab√≠a encontrado nada). Cuidado con eso, ya que nosotros nos arrepentimos de permitir que limpiaran la habitaci√≥n sin tener una caja de seguridad.",8,Verified traveler,2025-02-03

"Excellent service at check in and check out by the same employee at the counter. Allowed my son and I an early check in on a very cold day so we could add a layer of clothes and be on our way to an early hockey game. Totally nice about it and fully accomodating. Nice large rooms, well maintained, quiet. Didn't go to the bar this visit, but I have on previous visits and its great and bartenders are good and personable.

We had prepaid for a one bedroom suite and they did not honor the reservation because we booked through a third-party. Expedia/Hotels.com. I ended up with a standard king which was much less in price than what I prepaid and they refused to refund me saying we have to take it up with Hotels.com. I want a refund.

"Excellent old building that used to be a bank. The old vaults and other features are still there Rooms are modern, great AC, and super quiet. Security features like keys to go up elevators, nighttime car attendants, and guest only entry after 11 are also a plus. Bar in the lobby is a great place for a drink or to stay awhile plus they have a good restaurant on site as well.

"Beautiful hotel with some great references to when the building was a bank. Nice bar and small restaurant. Great service and easy walking or scooter distance from Union Station and other spots. Of the four USB power outlets in the room, the two near the desk did not work. One of the plugs at the desk was loose and would not work. Some specs on the ceiling around some fire sensor or something. Overall clean but if you are putting USB ports at a desk, maybe check them and keep them working?",10,Allen,2024-05-12

The checkin was quick and seamless and we even got an early check in!  The room was clean and comfortable.  The air temperature was adjustable  to our needs (my son likes it cool to sleep).  The staff were friendly at each interaction particularly the coffee shop server, he was awesome every day.  Great location near multiple restaurants and downtown shops.

"The Renaissance was perfectly located for all of the activities we needed to accomplish. Having our child seen at the Jewish Health Center we needed easy parking, convenient food options and the hotel staff were incredibly accommodating. Would absolutely stay here again. ",10,Sabrina,2023-10-31
"Room had outlets that didn‚Äôt work, lightbulbs that didn‚Äôt work, and bathroom sink did not drain well. ",6,Todd,2023-10-30
Our stay was great. The only thing we were disappointed with was that we had to pay for parking. The hotel would have been fairly priced if it included parking and not just valet. Overall we were satisfied ,10,Annette,2023-10-30

"Great place, girl at the check-in counter was super accommodating as we arrived early. The room was gorgeous, the location was great, we will definitely stay again if we return to Denver.",10,Amber,2023-10-03
"The rooms were super clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is very walkable and full of things to do and places to eat.  We walked to and from a game at Coors Field, and it was a pleasant route.  

The restaurant was amazing!(We ordered room service due to illness and it was awesome and on par price-wise with nearby restaurants. I had the bacon burger and wife had the leadville salad, and we also ordered some brocollini--highly recommend).  

The only downside was that the door did little to keep out noise from the hallway, and someone knocked loudly on our door at 3:30 in the morning and then disappeared, but I can't fault the hotel for that.  There was almost no noise from the street or adjoining rooms. The architecture of the building and the neighborhood were truly magnificent.  ",10,Gerrit,2023-10-02

The bed was very uncomfortable and the room was very small. The view faced a wall which didn‚Äôt allow much natural sunlight. ,4,Monique,2023-09-22

"The room service selection was very limited, I ordered twice and both times I received wrong items. The outside was very unsafe due to the amount of homeless people walking close by. Denver in general is not safe , the 16th street mall is comparable to skid row",6,Richard,2023-04-03
"The hotel was lovely and clean, excellent bed, very nice. The area the property is in had quite a lot of homeless people and some areas were a bit dirty. Walking distance to the Colorado Rockies baseball field.",8,Kath,2023-03-09

"Upon arrival we stood waiting in line to check in and when a staff member became available, instead of calling us over to help us, she turned and walked outside.  Once we were finally helped, we were told that the rooms we booked were not actually available as I'd been told on the phone. Then we had to wait 15 minutes because the rooms they were giving us weren't clean yet even though it was well after 4pm by this point. We were given free drink vouchers for during our wait, however the bartender walked away from the bar about this time and our rooms were actually ready before she came back. The rooms were very clean, which we greatly appreciated.  During breakfast the following morning we found ourselves waiting an inordinate amount of time for everything. Half the food came out, then a couple more plates, and by the time it was all out, half of it was cold. Several of the meals that were served had different ingredients than what was listed on the menu, and we were charged $40 for 2 carafes of sub par drip coffee. It took us a long time to get the checks when we were finished eating, and even longer to get our cards back.  Overall, we were incredibly disappointed in the customer service and wait times.  The cleanliness of the hotel and rooms was the single highlight of our stay. ",4,Jennifer,2023-02-21
