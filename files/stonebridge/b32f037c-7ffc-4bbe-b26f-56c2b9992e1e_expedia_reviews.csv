It was good. The front desk guy was always eating in the back when I came up to ask a question and his mouth was full of food. I did tell him that ,8,Melissa,2025-10-07
"Every interaction with staff was warm, genuine and helpful.

The front staff was very courteous however the room should have been cleaner. The refrigerator needed defrosted and the hotel is in need of remodeling. Breakfast was okay.,6,Peggy,2025-09-27
"The lobby atmosphere was very welcoming comfortable. But there was no maid service except every other day. For two days we stayed the room was not clean after the first day had to use same towels over, the trash was full.",8,Dennis,2025-09-26

Hotel room was dirty and we woke up with bug bites all over us.  Told the front desk and they couldnt do anything about it.  We were told the manager who was away would call later.  Of course no follow up.  Dont stay here,2,Verified traveler,2025-09-04
We reserved a room with 2 queen beds for 3 adults. We were told on checkin the hotel was overbooked and they gave us a room with a king and sofa bed. They said that booking through Expedia only guaranteed a room not a specific room type. The sofa bed was in no condition to sleep in. The mattress you could feel every spring and it was so thin you could feel the support bars going across too. ,4,Sharleen,2025-08-20
"My elderly aunt fell and was rushed to the hospital. The attention to her was great but the hotel did not have a bar which could have helped with her fall and the hotel did not have a wheelchair in site, which I was informed was the law",6,Juiana,2025-08-13

We had booked this as a necessary 1 night stop while traveling, but were very pleasantly surprised.",10,Verified traveler,2025-07-09
We selected the hotel because the website said it had roll aways for no extra charge - but it did not.  I did not pay attention that we would be charged for parking at the hotel.  I do not think this is good business since customers are already paying to stay there.  That is probably why the price was listed as cheaper on the website.,10,Natalee,2025-07-07

"The room was horribly dirty! The bathtub didn't drain, there was stuff all over the bathroom floor and underneath the vanity. I would not wear bare feet in that room. The headboards on the bed or very soiled and the towels in the bathroom we're not clean. Everything was dirty every table every drawer every edge every baseboard everything. The pool was dirty had bugs in it, the hot tub had weird hair and fuzz and bugs floating in it. The area where breakfast is served was also dirty so we had to eat just fruit so we could be sure that it was safe and we would not get sick. The ice machine areas were filthy with no scoop for the ice. The elevator was dirty. Everything was dirty literally everything!",2,Verified traveler,2025-05-18

"They charged $7 for uncovered parking, yet they literally ran out of toilet paper so we had to go buy some at Walmart. The room wasn’t very clean. The pull out sofa mattress smelled like urine. There was dog poop by one of the exit that never got cleaned up. Also, I thought it was no smoking but it smelled really bad in the lobby. There were tons of bugs and spiders in the pool. For the price we paid I expected it to be cleaner. If they would have left cleaning supplies I would have cleaned the room myself so we could have been more comfortable. The only plus was there was a bike path nearby that you could access to go to Boulder or Denver. However, No bike racks for storage so we stored our bikes in the room. ",4,Lindsay,2024-07-07

"Yes, if one reads the property description closely, it does state, ""Parking available."" If one expands the pop-up descriptive bubble, it states, ""Self parking on site (USD $$$$$$$ per day*)."" That 'disclaimer' is hidden to all unless there is some reason to click on the ""See all"" button - not something that most of us do unless we have some kind of 'heads-up' that instigates it. I didn't. I'm willing to bet that most people don't, so I was unprepared when the desk clerk told me that I would need to pay an additional $$$$$$$   $/2 fee for the privilege of parking in the hotel lot, which is actually more than what Expedia's website states. It may be ""just half -$,"" however there's a principle involved. Dishonesty and misrepresentation, regardless of the magnitude of the deception, is abhorrent. It was clear from the desk clerk's demeanor that this little 'surprise package' provokes a good deal of rancor from guests checking in. Much like my case, the deadline to cancel has passed, so one is either forced to pay the fee, park off the property and subject oneself to the possibility of having one's vehicle towed, or walk away without completing the registration, thus walk away while being responsible for at least one night's hotel cost and likely no recourse for recovery. This is opportunistic, wrong-headed and unethical. I recommend you consider going elsewhere rather than support such deceptive business practices. (count the $, above)",4,Wayne,2024-04-22

This hotel has drastically declined since the last time I stayed here before Covid. There was one person in the hotel trying to complete the breakfast operation as well as the front desk so service was terrible.

"There was consistently no one at the front desk every time we came in and we had to wait for someone to appear. Paying for parking here -- $7 a night is not much, but nonsensical. In the bathroom, there was no toilet paper holder, perhaps because there was not enough space to install one. The bathtub floor was oily and should have been cleaner (and safer). The pool was dirty.

"We stay at Hampton Inns frequently when we travel. They are usually very nice with high quality standards however this particular location was not the best. I think they are getting ready for renovations after hearing a conversation in the lobby but that doesn't really excuse not meeting some basic standards. When my husband took a shower, he put the provided toiletries in the shower with him, this is usually a small bottle of shampoo, condition and some sort of body wash. They only gave us 3 bottles of body lotion. I tried to call the front desk and the phone rang and rang with no answer. I had to go down to the desk and get the items and when I asked about the phone, was told they were not working. The tub didn't drain well so each shower we were standing in soapy water. When we went to bed, pulled back the covers and the sheet had brown stains on it. We could tell it was laundered and it was a permanent stains but a stained sheet should not be used.  Breakfast the next morning, the juice machine was broken and they were out of coffee around 9 am. A sign on the desk indicated a new charge of $7 nightly for parking which was not disclosed to us when booking. I will say the staff was very friendly and polite however seemed overworked and overwhelmed. We will continue to select Hampton Inn's but probably not this location when we return to this area.",6,Christina,2023-07-17

The other room we received, the bathroom light didn’t work, but at that point late in the night I chose to not switch rooms again.

Our AC didn’t work in the room. We called the desk to report it and see if we could switch rooms or have it looked at. The desk clerk told us we could leave or open the window.

"Staff was great but they are clearly having management/ownership issues. We frequently stay in Hampton Inns and while they aren’t upscale they are predictable and comfortable. This place was so run down. Chipped paint, dirty carpets, sour smell subdued by cleaning chemicals. Boxes everywhere, spills on floor, shaky elevator and they charge $7/night for parking despite an open lot that is damaged and had no security or gate. This fee is highly uncommon at a Hampton and was not disclosed on the site before booking. ",4,Katherine,2023-06-21
The staff was awesome and very willing to help with anything we needed.  The rooms were clean and very comfortable.  The ONLY complaint or issue I have is that the parking lot needs attention as it has big pot holes in the parking lot and with a $7 a day charge for parking you would think the parking lot would be maintained.  I have never stayed anywhere they charge you an additional amount to park.  ,10,Sidney,2023-06-18

6. I was surprised at a $7.00 parking fee when they have a large lot and adequate spaces for cars. 
7. The check out person was wonderful, attentive, listened, made notes and cancelled the parking fee. 
Disappointed in the general condition of this property. I would say not up to the standard of mostHampton Inns.",6,Megan,2023-04-23

Me pareció bien que la personal de limpieza fue amable y ofrecía sus servicios. Lo que no me gusto fue que la temperatura del agua de la piscina estaba muy fría.,10,Ruth,2023-03-13
"The staff was fantastic- friendly and very accommodating.  I appreciate them going out of their way to get me into my room—
Quickly! Excellent customer service. ",10,Mary Kay,2023-03-10
"Room had a musty pet smell.  Pool was neat, but not the most well kept (tiles falling off of wall, etc.)",8,Scott,2023-03-06
"Upon checking in I discovered breakfast stared at 7 vs 6. I explained to the lady that our entire VB team was staying there and had to be to a tournament at 7. A guy behind me said his team was staying there as well. So 20+ rooms that needed early breakfast. In the morning I came down at 6:25 and was looking in the breakfast room. The front desk, lady very of snottily told me that breakfast would not be ready until 7 o’clock. We left and went to McDonalds across the street. Right after paying at 6:40 a team member text everyone that the breakfast was open. ",4,Kathryn,2023-03-02

"The staff were attentive and kind - even when we had someone above us who made a ton of noise all night. They took care of us and made it right and were very apologetic. Good location, near freeway. ",10,Kati,2023-02-12
Great staff all around.  Did not like the surprise $7 a day parking fee.  Receptionist mentioned that it was listed in the amenities section of the listing on Orbitz.  It was not an obvious fee at the time of booking and felt that it was a cost that should just be included in the daily rental rate. ,10,Richard,2023-02-12

"Hotel was not booked a capacity and I was given a very undesirable room… second floor right over the rooftop, which is not very safe. In addition, there was a huge mechanical room right outside my window, blocking any light whatsoever. I had to have the light on the entire time, and there was only one light in the room. Bathroom lighting very dim, refrigerator was dirty and ran continuously so I had to unplug it. Also, the toilet would not stop running. ",4,Linda,2023-02-08

"Breakfast- teen who has stayed in a lot of hotels said it was the best he’s seen. Very pleased with that. We didn’t use pool and we’re only there essentially to sleep and get ready to leave in the morning. Brought our dog, great places to go out. Didn’t come in contact with too many employees but all we did talk to were great. Room was good, beds good. Clearly parking lot not so great but looks like they’re aware of that. We were happy with our stay.",8,Ashley,2023-02-02
"It was fine.  I was a little irritated to arrive and find out that they charge $7 for parking.  This is a Hampton Inn in the middle of nowhere between Denver and Boulder.  

I was more irritated to get into our room, after a long day of travel, to find that the bathroom light wasn't working at all.  Instead, they plugged a table lamp in the bathroom, which gave out less than ideal light and took up a good chunk of the counter.

Other than that, it was a fine stay.  The staff was friendly and the breakfast was pretty good. ",8,Pat,2023-02-02

"The room was larger than what I was expecting. It is nice not to have to bump into everything in the room while trying to walk.

The parking was a little awkward. ",10,DARYL,2023-01-20
"They charge for parking.  This is NOT a city property. 
 Parking is free at every hotel in our town as is most parking lots.  The hotel needs care and if you are going to charge $75 for a pet fee, 1. tell us at check in and 2. pick up after animals if your customers don't.  Take care of your space.",6,Micah,2023-01-17
"My room had no bathroom light , no blackout shade & a broken remote. I’d already been moved to a different room from my original ( 2barking dogs in the room next to mine) ",6,Kathryn,2023-01-08
Property was clean.  Grandkids enjoyed the pool and hot tub.  They also like the warm cookies in the lobby at bedtime.  Good breakfast.  Appreciated the fridge and microwave in the room.  Missed in the description that there was $7 daily parking charge. ,10,Kathleen,2023-01-02
