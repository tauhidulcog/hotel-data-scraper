"Condition of room was not good - leak out of toilet, the sliding bedroom door wouldn't close because the 'pull' handle structure actually pulled out of door (problem because I had early meeting and family trying to sleep), and dripping tub faucet.  I'd stayed here several years ago and it was ok but now appears degraded. ",4,Brad,2025-09-23
Family friendly and good breakfast choices. ,8,Yvette,2025-09-23
"The thermostat didn't work.  The room was freezing.  It was very dark and seemed very small compared to other Embassy Suite rooms we've stayed in.  They didn't input our Hilton Honors number and we had to do all kinds of work arounds to get wifi.  They said our room was near a door, but that door didn't unlock from the outside.  The reception was disappointing.  Few chairs and tables, very meager food offered.",4,Deborrah,2025-09-22
"I've been going there for nearly 20 years, but it has been several years since I've stayed there. It used to be very nice, but they've really let it go. 
It needs a complete remodel, especially in the room.

"The staff was friendly and excellent at their job. The hotel was very clean. The only issue was that it is very rundown. My room was like staying inside of a thrift store. All the furniture is extremely worn and stained. All the walls have marks and chips and even splatters on them. The ceiling in the bathroom has a rust spots on it. The wallpaper is peeling. Actual hole in the carpet. The outside landscaping is neglected, broken boards on surrounds. The fire lane curb hasn’t been scraped or painted in many years. All these issues just show there has been no money put into this hotel and it needs to be remodeled in its entirety. I did like the mattress and I slept very good in the bed.",10,Klinton,2025-09-09

"i liked that beds were comfy , room layout and the service provided by the staff,
The property is in ,need of remodeling or cleaning or something better...
 to start with  the bad ,  sofa  in the loby was felty ,, so are the carpeting ,  the building is neglected , paint peeling off , some parts you can see the frame , some of the wood damaged by termites , broken window eand door and window frame weathered , the grounds looked unatended for months , doog poop and fencing around the a/c units  damaged , in the room the fridge was frozen solid, had to clean up the ice in order to use it , under the fridge was nasty , one of the drawer fell off as i was pulling it , it was fix with silicone and glue 
everithing was dated except the  TVs , lost of silicone used in the bathroom , the courtain rod support almost falling off ,  the bottom line the rating should be 2.5 stars 
rather then 3.5  , 
the good things i can  mantion the  beds were comfy and clean , could use some new bedding , i liked the tvs
that was the only thing looking good or updated in the room,  the breakfast was a nice touch, but thats not enough, to earn those stars  posted , sorry i didn't mantion one day did not have water for 7 hours ,  ",6,PETRE,2025-09-03
Breakfast options ,10,Robin,2025-09-03
"The room was inexpensive and easy to book on Hotel.com.  So, my expectations were tempered, as yours should be.  The guests above me were banging around until almost midnight and I had to be up at 6AM.  Call to the desk was ineffectual.  The toilet had a phantom flush, also not good for restful sleep.  I could not get the AC to stop blowing freezing air, so I turned it off.  The TVs are not smart (no mirroring) and had the old timey cable choices with no Guide.  When I checked in, I was not asked for my Hilton number so the internet would not have been free.  I went to the desk and remedied that.  The rear parking lot was sketch.  There were unsavory characters cutting through from the adjacent area.  I found the last parking spot in front.

On the bright side, the breakfast was plentiful and decent.  Even had an omelet bar and fountain coke products (yay!) 

Would I do it again?  Maybe.  I was only there to sleep in anticipation of hiking Mt. Humphreys the next morning - which I did.  ",6,Joel,2025-09-02
"On check in, they stated Orbitz was declined for an unknown reason. The clerk said they would contact Orbitz to get the payment cleared. In the meantime, they placed a hold on my card. During check out, a new clerk said they NEVER do that and it was all on us, and they were charging us on my card given to them. They REFUSED to provide any type of receipt of the transactions and were overall rude about how they handled business. 

I will never go to this hotel again solely on their lack of consistency. ",2,Jeremy,2025-09-01

The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. I was in town for a medical procedure and they were able to check me in a little early so I could get some rest. The room was very nice and well laid out! ,10,Neva,2025-08-27
"When we checked in, the toilet in the room was flooding all the way out towards the room and carpet. We had to request a different room. The new room was very dirty, the sofas were ripped, the carpet area felt like the floor underneath had big bubbles, and as we stepped in certain areas, it would sink in. Overall, dirty, and kept, therefore it created for a very uncomfortable and horrible experience. We do not recommend this place at all.  ",4,Elin,2025-08-23

multiple attempts at replacing never happened 
our bathroom sink was plugged and we reported it the only thing they did was remove the drain opener and left it on our sink  very unsightly 
there was a mixup at front desk with the room we paid for and was not given to us

"The hotel needs a serious update. Furniture and furnishings old and dirty, some broken. Doors stick....odd odors in the hallways. It's just not what it used to be.

"This Embassy Suites is definitely an older model.  It was comfortable and clean but you can tell it needs a major facelift.  For some reason, there is a towel in the bathroom vent and there is a rip in the sofa.  We came here to work and it served its purpose.  Also, the price was indicative of the age.  ",6,John,2025-08-04
"Looks like this property is on its last legs. No hand soap in the entire hotel. Room was filthy. Hair from previous guest all over the bathroom, sofa had stains and holes in it, carpet by sofa was damp and looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in days. Thermostat didn't actually adjust anything, only turned A/C on or off, so it either ran constantly or not at all. Staff was nice, but kinda checked out. ",2,Mitchell,2025-08-04
"Liked that a two bedroom, two bath suite was available for a family of 6. 

Beds were comfy. Kids loved the pool and the breakfast!!

My family and I were very disappointed with the room.  It was very dirty.  From the stained furniture to the filthy carpet.  The smell in the room was very unpleasant.  We had to keep the air blasting to cover up the odor.  The bathroom had very evident mold on the ceiling.  It was black.  The only positive was that the bedding was clean.  We were all uncomfortable the entire time due to the unsanitary conditions.  Thankfully we only stayed one night.  The restaurant had a broken window on the outside with glass all over the ground and grassy area.  It appeared that it had been left like that for some time.  It is a hazard and danger for a child/dog.  The pool area looked very unkept and dirty.  The jacuzzi was discolored.  The electrical box outside the pool was broken and hanging open.  That cannot be safe.  They really need to clean up the property.  My husband called front desk and complained about the condition of the room and they told us that we could leave and go somewhere else if we didn’t like it.  We really should have but we were too tired and just decided to stick it out for the night.  We left first thing in the morning. I do not recommend.  It was not cheap to stay at this hotel either.  I can guarantee a motel on the side of the road would be cleaner and half the price.  I do not recommend this property.  ,2,Shiva,2025-07-21

"First of all, I want to start off with the hotels.com lied about the hotel with their pretty little pictures and I don't appreciate that. I really do hope that they stop that and be honest. Let's better up this world than rather making it continuesly worst, starting with honesty please and thank you. 
But about the room was quite small , which was a given four hundred and fifty square feet. To be honest with the price that I paid.And the way it seemed to me or at least what hotels.com was trying to lay out to me.It seemed like it was a little much bigger suite and that's what I was hoping for. It was little disappointing. But I can honestly say that I do regret not browsing around for another hotel. Perhaps I got a little too excited on this one because believing hotels.com",6,Navani,2025-07-08

"Room was not clean at all. Cheerios on the side of the bed and when we pulled out the sofa bed. Bed was the worst bed I’ve ever had in a hotel. Every footstep of the people above us shook the room and every word from neighbors on either side was clearly heard. A/c unit was outdated and ran non stop, provided great white noise but at volume 100.  ",4,Ashley,2025-07-05

Cooked to order now only applies to omelets.Waffles and pancakes are prepackaged. Night manager deal is stale snacks. We stayed June 29-July 1 and the breakfast cook was very rude. What a bad experience and a disappointment.The rooms in the small cove was extra loud when the next room started slamming door at midnight,4,sharon,2025-07-01
"I like the access into the building through additional side doors, that way if I need to park farther in the back I dont have to lug all my stuff around front. Very convenient. I was able to walk to dinner with many options.",10,Zoe,2025-07-01
"Hotel was extremely old.  We typically stay at Embassy Suits and were ok paying more.  The staff was polite but the building was extremely old and pool was very dirty.  The room had carpet peeling, torn furniture and dirty walls.

"Various maybe small things, but very noticeable. Microwave plate missing. Room cleaning inconsistent. Wastebaskets had no bag insert, maid left very large plastic bag for trash one day. Water very slow to warm up in shower. Carpet possibly unclean, since white socks became dirty.  Breakfast: generally OK but often missing some items for a time. A/C seemed to never cool below 71degrees.

Good: nice large TV in 2nd room of suite, beds comfortable.

Would likely not stay at this location again.",6,Ronald,2025-06-27
"The hot tub was good. It was difficult to get into and out of the hot tub. The step is too deep and too high for elderly person who can not make large step up or down to get into the hot tub. 
There was not enough waste baskets in the room. There was only one near the bathroom.
The shower faucet was not mounted properly. It moved when you tried to use it.
Staff was nice and accommodating.
We were expecting couch in the room but we a lounge chair for my grandson to sleep on.",8,Victoria,2025-06-26

"Our AC wasn’t working and the maintenance went into our room while we were away, even though the “do not disturb” sign was on the door. It gave us a scare when we got back to our room and the vent cage was down and a ladder was in our room. It would have been nice to be given the heads up. The pool was also murky and the jacuzzi water was lukewarm. We normally love staying at Embassy but this one left a bad taste in our mouths. ",6,Sydney,2025-06-09

Said housekeeping staff was limited and couldn’t keep up with the demand for laundry service, therefore there was a shortage of towels. We did not use the pool for lack of towels.

"Pros:
Convient to get to. 
Breakfast was fantastic, we loved the build your own omelette. 
The bed & pillows were comfortable.
The front desk girl who checked us in was very sweet.

Cons:
Hotel doesn't seem to get deep cleaned. The sofas in the lobby had a bunch of stains. None of the corners in the hotel looked clean, it was a little gross. 
The microwave in our room had a big burned stain in the back of it which made us not want to use it.
Their TVs were having issues during our stay.
The sofa & sofa bed were VERY uncomfortable. 
The hotel ""security"" kicked two of my family members out of the hot tub shortly after 8pm staring that the ""hot tub closed at 8pm"" even though the sign right next to it said it was open until 10pm. When we asked about it he just said ""too bad. Its posted somewhere else that it closes at 8pm"". Fix your signs if that is the case. 
The parking lot was small in front so youll need to drive around to look for a spot to park.

For how much they charged us for our room this stay could have been a lot better than it was.",6,Verified traveler,2025-04-28

"I went during spring break in 2024.  It was very busy in the evenings and morning for breakfast.  Also there was snow in the area so a lot of people went up for the snow.  My kids had the most fun playing in the snow in front of the hotel, they were out there for more than an hour each day we were there.   

 I feel like the room could use an upgrade.  I know its a hotel and sees a lot of people so I get it will get beat up a bit.  They have the nightly managers receiption in the bar.  Willie the bartender was great, but I wish they had more lightning in there.  The snacks they put out get cleaned out in less than 15 mins of the opening.   

They charge $11 per day to park there which is sort of an odd money grab.  There is a gas station across the street if you want to save a dollar or two on snacks.  There are also restaurants in walking distance of the hotel  Bun Huggers has great burgers, but is a bit pricey.  In all, I would say its a good value with the breakfast and drinks in the evening. The staff are attentative as well. ",6,Daniel,2025-03-18

"First of all, I do want to note that the staff was friendly and kind and were doing the best they could. The facilities definitely need some renovation as the overall experience was much less than what I expect from an Embassy Suites. They ran out of towels, the fridge didn't work, the heating system would keep blowing hot air even when it shouldn't, etc. There were several issues that made for it to be an experience that was below my expectations, especially for the price point. The breakfast was solid, however, there was not enough seating to serve the guests.  ",4,Danielle,2025-01-02
"The hotel is ok the room is kind of outdated with an old carpet that was smelly on top of that the room service didnt clean the bathroom during a 3 night stay and didn't replace dirty towels, we have to go and ask the room service once we were back for the clean ones",6,Cecilio,2024-12-31
"The carpet is old/dirrty/ripped. The mattress is old/sunk in the middle. Housekeeping doesn’t clean for the second day stay! Took out the dirty towels but not replace them!

Slept terrible it was noisy with the loud traffic going by outside and every time a person in the room next to us used there bathroom it was so loud it sounded like construction going on next door.

"The property was okay and in a good location but outside the trash cans were full the entire weekend, never picked up for 3 days! 

The hotel is on the older side which we don’t mind but it was dirty! 


The room carpet and furniture wasn’t clean especially the bathroom! I had to disinfect everything and clean! I was too embarrassed to ask to be moved. 
The price was okay but on the expensive side which should be because they don’t seem to take well care of the hotel. 

The other issue we experienced was the elevator not working and when we asked the front desk the lady said “oh yeah that is normal. Sometimes our elevator stops working and it needs to be reset but we have stairs”. 
I stood there with my hands full of bags and my kids…. I literally had to ask her “so will it get fixed”? And she hesitated to respond so I just said: “can you please call someone”? I have two kids and grocery bags and we’re on the 3 floor so we can’t do the stairs. She finally said yes and it hit fixed in about 30 mins. But serious okay I had to ask her?! Wow 

The only thing nice was again the location and the fact that they give you two complimentary drinks to 2 adults if checked in with the exception of the day you checks out.

"The staff was very nice, but that is where it ended.  The grounds were cluttered with trash.  The common areas of the hotel were filthy, trash cans over flowing, dirty carpets.  Our room, the furniture was stained, frayed and worn out.  The floors were dirty, the tile in the bathroom was grimy.  Very disappointing for the amount we paid.  Also, the hotel does do ‘cash’ transactions, but refused to accept cash for their little store.  There was no sign that it was cashless. Unacceptable to not accept legal tender for goods.  Will not be staying here again.",2,Dorothey,2024-12-03

No apologies nothing offered. They only gave us one key because they were out. The room smelled of mildew. I woke up in the morning with weird bumps on my neck. The body wash in the shower was empty. For breakfast nearly every ketchup bottle was empty. This hotel seemed to be out of everything. I made my concerns known in the morning when I checked out and she didn’t seem to care just made excuses, no apologies. I asked if she could offer a discount and she said no.",2,Rebekah,2024-10-14

"When we walked into the room many things were awry, to include the sofa bed not being put together (the cushions were dirty and piled on the other side of the room.  Someone’s left overs were still in the refrigerator, the lampshade was completely crooked and the bathroom ceiling had black mold spots on it. My husband proceeded to clean all of the surfaces with bleach wipes and I do not believe that room has been cleaned frequently.  The following night we found out why the bathroom has black mold:  At about 11:40 p.m. we heard rushing water coming from the bathroom.  Water was pouring out of the light fixture of the bathroom ceiling, soaking the room.  When we called guest services they apologized for the inconvenience and brought us extra towels so we could clean it up.  We cut our stay there a day short and when we checked out I  once again informed the front desk about the bathroom flooding/mold/etc and cleanliness of the room.  She was dismissive, and didn’t seem interested in our account of what happened.  Needless to say, we will not be visiting this location anymore for further visits.  No offer was made for us to change rooms or even be compensated for our inconvenience, apart from giving us a couple of bottles of water and two bags of chips.  For something with the Hilton name behind it, it was beyond disappointing.",2,Crystal,2024-10-09
"I’ve stayed in countless Embassy Suites and this is the worst. Can’t believe it’s in the chain or tied to Hilton. Cracks in ceiling and lots of active mold growing in bathroom and living room ceiling (all pictured to post elsewhere). Carpet was worn out and dirty, couches looked like second hand store furniture, stains on cushions, and tears on arms. Also, milk was sour at breakfast to the point several other guests were warning people as they were getting their breakfast. A man came out and looked at it from the kitchen but I didn’t see him change anything. Overall just a tired and worn out property that shouldn’t be compared to other Embassy Suites. I would never stay here again, and if this was my only experience with the brand, I’d never try a different one.",2,Gabriel,2024-10-09
"Property is old and staff uninterested in helping. Check in took close to an hour late in the evening with small children as they could not find the Expedia reservation—which Expedia was emailing me to confirm daily including during that time. I think they oversold and were simply scrambling, but when I book a room for my large family, I expect to have that, not be split into two random rooms in an arrangement that does not work for us.

"This Hotel is in dire need of updates.
It is dirty and disgusting.

The hallways were littered with the free popcorn they give out, and over 2 days it was never cleaned up.

The AC in my room was broken, and remained so after it was supposedly “fixed” by maintenance.

The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling, the lock on the bathroom door was broken, the carpet in the room was torn, the fabric on the sleeper sofa was torn, the mini fridge’s door wouldn’t close, the master bedroom was missing a light bulb in one lamp, and the cover on the ironing board was damaged and wouldn’t stay on.

To add insult to injury, I was over-charged for the cost of my room that I spent 2 nights enduring.

It should have been $249 (minus taxes) per night. But lo and behold they charged me $301 (minus taxes) per night!

DO NOT EVER, EVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL.

The couple front desk people who I talked to WERE very nice. However, the property itself is trash.

There was nothing they could do to solve my problems except give me a small rotating fan to place in my room, and gift me with an “I’m Sorry For The Inconvenience” Bag, containing a Kit Kat bar, a bag of Skittles, and 2 bottles of Coke.

So there you have it:

For $700, I got to sleep in a puddle of my own sweat for 2 nights, in a run-down joke of a “Suite”, hearing kids run around the hallways at all hours.

I read online that many others have been overcharged, and had an equally terrible experience.",2,Matthew,2024-08-23

They had no food available for the entire time I was there, over 30 minutes, except for waffles and my family that arrived earlier told me they didn’t have any food since 7:00 ish.  They had empty food warmers for several breakfast items and an omelette bar that was closed that they advertised prominently.  There were no plates, trash was overflowing, no staff visible, no drinks except for OJ.  I purposely looked for a hotel that had a breakfast so I didn’t have to go get something in the morning with my 2 kids.  I understand delays happen but no food for 90 minutes or so is unacceptable and will certainly make sure I never stay at another Hilton hotel.  ",2,Verified traveler,2024-06-30

We were in Flagstaff in Feb - right after a big snowstorm. My only advice is to avoid the parking spots at the front of the hotel.

Our room had ugly tile repair and lamps with power socket but no phone charger would fit. Overall not up to Hilton standards ,6,Steve,2024-02-12

"Great comfortable space for families. Nice to have breakfast included (it gets crazy busy and challenging to get food at certain times) and complimentary happy hour. Hotel is older and it shows in the worn carpet, stains on furniture, rusted metal throughout the bathrooms and stains on walls. ",6,Carrie,2024-02-04
room set up was nice,8,Debra,2024-02-01
Bad experience our toilet was clogged couldn't use the restroom upon arrival. Maintnance took forever to go we had to demand someone to clean as toilet overflowed or switch rooms but no other rooms available. Had to wait over an hour for them to go and wipe restroom not do a full cleaning.,4,Adriana,2024-01-30

Overall was a good stay and would stay here again. Considering the season in Flag the price was fair. We really enjoyed the breakfast and happy hour. Location is good with access to anything we needed. The room was good for the most part. Kids enjoyed the sofa bed. Only downsides are the king bed wasn't the most comfortable and the air in the room didn't seem to be working right as it stayed pretty warm in the room no matter how low we set the temp. ,8,Jesse,2023-12-17

"I wanted to start by saying that the staff was amazing. I’m not even sure how the room we stayed in (137) passed inspection The window opened up to the pool area with no safety measures to keep kids out of the pool area if they were to get out the window. I brought my 2 and 4 year old with us to enjoy the North Pole experience and the first thing my 4 year old wanted to do was open the window. I didn’t even want to leave the window open since they would have open access to the swimming pool area (which he noticed all in his own. He said “Mom, I can get to the pool from our room without having to go outside”) the other thing that was very unsafe was the security lock/ latch was so low on the door that my 2 year old was able to lock and unlock it on her own. We didn’t notice she even knew that she could do that until I walked out of the room while my husband was in the room with her and when I came back the latch to the door was locked and she is the one who locked it. While we were in the room we watched her unlock it on her own. This made me worried to have the kids sleep on the pull out couch.  I wouldn’t consider staying here again with kids due to the lack of safety. These are a few safety measures I would take into consideration before putting another family with young kids in this room. My husband is a first responder and we are very aware of our surroundings given what he deals with on a daily basis. My in laws stayed in a room down the hall with the same window issue.

"There was a bucket in the middle of a hallway because of a leak.  Our carpet was worn through in at least two areas.  The heater made a high pitch whine when it was on for more than a few minutes, all thought he night. The tub does not have a no slip surface.",6,Clayton,2023-12-03

"I have to say this hotel is one of the best in Flagstaff. Very convenient, clean, staff was friendly.

The only thing was the lack of tables during breakfast, we had to sit in the lobby to eat the two days we stayed. Nothing to do with the hotel, but wish the other guest consider the ones that were standing/waiting for them to finish having their long conversations when they were done eating.

Other than that I would defenetly recomment this hotel to my friends. ",10,Antonio,2023-11-13

"Very disappointed.  The room furnishings were old and worn.   No towel racks in the bathroom. Charge $8 to park in Flagstaff???  I guess this pays for the free afternoon drinks. Breakfast was only one step above a continental breakfast, the omelets were flat and overcooked.",4,Judy,2023-10-30

"First... the staff was good. They were attentive and helpful to the extent that we dealt with them. No complaints about that.

The overall property, and especially the room was old and worn out. There was a drill like noise that occurred randomly throughout the night, and it felt like every door slammed shut. For an Embassy Suites, it was pretty sub-standard from my experience. I doubt I would stay at this location again. It's not the worst hotel I've ever stayed at, but for the price and brand, disappointing.",6,Rebecca,2023-10-08

"Knew something was not right when we checked in the front desk was friendly but eating her Taco Bell dinner at counter. Not sure that is very clean as have to use your hands to eat that food. Then getting to room curtains torn, windows not working, missing screen. Furniture worn, old and dirty. Shower grout rusty, and a child’s toilet. Have stayed at Embassy suites before and always trusted the hotels, but now not sure I ever will.",6,Debra,2023-09-24

Great location and next to the University. Lots of restaurants and shops nearby.  The only complaint is the hotel is very old and the rooms need DEFINITE updating.  We were afraid to sit on the couch as there were some questionable stains. ,8,Jerry,2023-09-15
"The overall experience was great . The staff were all wonderful and friendly . The room was comfortable, the breakfast delicious , the hotel is old and in need of some TLC and updates , but we will stay again .

I was very disappointed with the condition of the hotel. Really old outdated facility. Toilet was made for a young child. Beds were uncomfortable and small. Coffee service in room was a joke. Also you should let your customers know you're going to charge them $8.00 a day to stay on your own property. What a joke. ,4,Laura,2023-08-26

"Front Desk check in Matt i believe his name was great and helpful.  Rooms AC did not work very well on the 3rd floor and we arrived too late to try and switch rooms.  Screens on the windows were in bad shape and need to be replaced.  Breakfast was nice.  Outside traffic noise was very loud all night so made it hard to get a good nights rest.  Digital keys did not work on outside doors, only the rooms so that was inconvenient. Hotel was clean but we didnt have a very good stay. ",4,Christopher,2023-07-11

The hotel was ok but by far one of the least quality embassy’s we have stayed at. The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling away and it wasn’t very clean. The staff were not very inviting and just seemed to not want to be there. The couch cushions were ripped and the room just didn’t seem well maintained. ,6,Misty,2023-06-27
The staff was awesome and the bartender for happy hour was amazing. The elevators were gross and the third floor smelt like someone got sick on the carpets. The breakfast was great and offered a lot of options. For almost $500 a night I would expect it a lot cleaner. The two bedroom room was fine but the couches are worn and the water had a funky smell. ,8,Jeremy,2023-06-26

"I seldom give feedback on a hotel stay.  I thought that Embassy Suites by Hilton would be an upscale experience.  There were a few glaring deficiencies. First, reception sent us to a room that was not made up, next they sent us to an occupied room. Finally, we arrived at our room.  It was semi clean. The best part was the hot water (they get a plus for that). The outlet in the bathroom sink did not work and resisted being reset. Downstairs on the first floor there were signs directing people to 1) the pool (this led to the parking lot) and 2) to the lobby (an almost 180-degree direction away from the lobby).  The bed was lumpy but there were enough blankets (it was in the single digits during the nights).  The website on Expedia indicates there is a restaurant (one of the reasons we chose this place). There was no restaurant but there was an adequate breakfast, and you could order at the grill for things such as omelets. There was a happy hour that we did not participate in but appeared to be well attended. Overall, the room and facility felt like it had seen better days.  Hilton would do well to put money and training into this site.  ",4,Robert,2023-01-27
