It’s so cool that it’s a old school turned into a hotel ,10,Gabriela Noel,2025-09-24

"I recently stayed at The Slate Hotel in downtown Denver and I found it to be very convenient in terms of its location because it was within walking distance of most of the places I wanted to go.

Everyone I interacted with on the staff was very friendly and helpful.

The hotel was also very quiet.  It is my opinion that most of the people who stay at this hotel are probably in town for business, since the hotel is next to the Colorado Convention Center.  For this reason, I don't think there were many children, if any, present.  I think the lack of children helped to make the atmosphere much quieter than it may have been otherwise.  Also, my room was right next to the elevators, and I rarely heard the ding from the elevators or the noise from people talking in the hallways as they got on or off the elevators.

My particular room did not have a safe and I have read mixed opinions on whether an in-room safe is actually present.  While this did not really affect me, I know having a safe in the room is important for some people, so you might want to check ahead of time if this is important to you.

One concern I had after I had completed my stay was whether the hotel's staff was actually committed to saving the environment, as was indicated on the sign in the bathroom regarding reusing towels, etc.  I followed the instructions indicating that I wished to reuse my bathroom linens, but they were changed out on consecutive days despite this fact.

Overall, I would stay here again.",8,Clyde Lofton,2025-09-24

"My husband and I loved our stay at this hotel. This was our first time visiting Denver for a weekend trip, and we were so grateful to be accommodated with an early check-in at 1PM after our flight arrived ahead of schedule. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming, which we truly appreciated.

The hotel is clean, well-maintained, and thoughtfully decorated. We also enjoyed the convenience of having an onsite bar and restaurant. Its location is ideal—right next to the convention center and within walking distance of 16th Street, where there are plenty of shopping and dining options.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would gladly return on our next visit to Denver.",10,Cynthia,2025-09-19

"I loved this hotel! If you like an academia vibe you will definitely like it. The common areas are especially well decorated. 
Everything is super clean and looks new. Beds are comfy. AC is excellent. Street parking was easy and free on Sunday and holidays. 
We had a main level corner room that faced the courtyard. The windows were huge and it was shockingly quiet. Not much view other than the other buildings in the school compound. If you want a grand lobby or big views or a pool, this is not the place. 
We had breakfast at the restaurant twice and it was excellent. Great coffee too. Service any time we were in the common areas was really good.
I would definitely return. My elementary kids also loved it, including the giant pencil statues outside. They got a kick out of sleeping in a school!

"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at The Slate. The hotel set up in an old high school made for such a unique and cute stay. The bar was fully stocked and had excellent and attentive bar tenders and the mini gift shop was supplied with any last minute essentials you could need, even a cute little ice cream freezer! The valet was always very quick with bring my car out. The hotel is located just a 15-30 minutes walk outside of downtown Denver and has few places around to explore night life but was still a very enjoyable stay, would definitely book here again.",10,Sarah,2025-09-02

The hotel was neat and clean, and our room (#204) was amazing!  The location was perfect.  Close to the convention center, restaurants and stores.  The on-site restaurant was nice, the waiters were nice and friendly, and the food was delicious!  I HIGHLY  recommend this hotel to anyone that's inquiring.  I will definitely stay here again. Oh, and I love that it was once a school that was converted into a hotel. Absolutely beautiful place; the decor, the wallpaper in the bathroom, the pictures on the wall, etc!

"

From the moment we walked in, The Slate impressed us with its modern style and historic charm. The building’s schoolhouse-inspired design is such a unique nod to Denver’s past, and the décor blends elegance with playful details.

Our room was spotless, comfortable, and well-appointed, with plush bedding and thoughtful touches that made our stay feel special. The staff went above and beyond—warm, welcoming, and eager to help with anything we needed.

The location is perfect—close to downtown attractions, restaurants, and the convention center, but still peaceful enough for a good night’s rest. The on-site restaurant and bar were also fantastic, with great food and a cozy atmosphere.

If you’re visiting Denver and want a stay that feels both stylish and memorable, The Slate is a perfect choice. ",10,Tassie,2025-08-15

The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly. The history attached as the building used to house a school is an added and fun bonus. It’s really neat! Recommend!",10,Darren,2025-08-12

"The mattress had public hairs on it beneath the supposedly “fresh sheets” when we arrived — I always check the mattress before I go to sleep. 

Noisy upstairs neighbors, all night stomping around and dropping heavy items. Disappointed with the unfriendly check-in by brunette Caucasian woman staffer who was too busy flirting with another guest )who was checking in nearby) than to help answer my questions. 

Just way too much money for such a subpar service and hotel. Go to Hyatt Tapestry closer to 16th and market. Much nicer and closer to restaurants and shopping. Similar prices. We had family staying there and regretted not also booking there!! ",6,Christianne Danielle Van,2025-08-06
We stayed at The Slate the night of the Josh Johnson 9:30 show at the Paramount and it was an easy walk to the theater. The hotel is tucked in a bit and quieter than would be expected for a “downtown” hotel and was perfect for our needs. ,10,Lynn,2025-08-05

"Overall, it was almost an excellent experience. 
Pros: easy and early check-in
Easy and late check-out
Friendly staff, particularly Michael
When I asked to move to rooms, it was accommodated quickly  
Hotel is modern and comfortable 
Comfy beds, sheets and pillows
Restaurant on premises - decent rates and good food, delivered quickly. Nice experience. 

Cons: 
Basement rooms lack natural light and most importantly are very cold. The temperature in my room wouldn't go above 63 degrees. I asked to move rooms. 
Air conditioner blows cold air directly on to you - as the rooms are compact, it's not  pleasant experience. 
I would stay there again. Pros certainly outweigh the cons. ",8,Jinny,2025-07-30

"I was extremely disappointed with this hotel, especially when spending almost $300 a night. It is not mentioned on here that the room they could give you is below grade in the basement of the hotel with windows that are 7 feet from the ground and are completely frosted over with no view to outside. That is completely unacceptable and when I brought this up to the staff at the front desk, they basically said yeah sorry if you want a different room, you can pay more. And I said why I should be aware of that before I book also there was no ladder or any sort of way to get out that window in the case of a fire. After that I try to just make the best of it and the bed was so hard and uncomfortable. I woke up all night tossing and turning I was shocked for a luxury hotel about the discomfort. The elevator smell really bad. I will never stay here again. I am a business traveler who spends 6 to 7 days a month in a hotel and this is been one of the biggest disappointments I’ve had in a long time.",2,Andrew,2025-07-24

"Negatives: Our room was comparably noisy (cars, screaming poeple an a Saturday night, lots of sirens), they charge $2.50 for a small bottle of water unless you have any Hilton Honors status of silver+, parking was $59/night (valet), and the room wasn't equipped with any showercaps or other similar necessities you would expect in such a hotel. They offer to text with the reception staff for any questions but they never replied. I perceived the receptionist at checkout as rather unfriendly. Some of the USB outlets at the desk and nightstand weren't working, which is bothersome if you have two people with laptops, phones, cameras, etc. I was glas I had a powerful powerbank with me.
Positives: It was very clean and modern, and has a special charme to it. We walked to Union Square and RiNo and found it very walkable, but definitely got our steps in. I liked the desk in the room, which allowed for seated and standing working (which is a a great choice if you need to work a lot, like me). The receptionist at check-in was very friendly and they were able to accommodate us ~1.5 hrs before check-in. It is super close to the convention center, and there is some paid street parking available. They have a 24hr self-service mini market and the gym looked well equipped (didnt try it, though).
Final thought: it is a nice, modern and very clean hotel. I definitely would book again if I got a decent rate, however I have experienced better hospitality and room equipment in other upscale hotels.",8,Patrizia,2025-07-22
"I would highly recommend staying at The Slate Denver.  The location is extremely convenient to the Convention Center, which made running back and forth easy and fast.  The front desk staff were friendly, helpful and efficient.  They made check in a breeze, and were able to help me with a request.  The room itself was clean, quiet and very cute - the school theming continues in the rooms and hallways, which is a nice change from typical hotel decor.  I do plan on staying at this hotel for future stays in Denver.",10,Verified traveler,2025-07-21

Welcoming staff at this nicely upgraded old school. Our initial room there was a loud constant buzzing noise. We told front desk and they moved us to new room and gave a voucher for restaurant and coffee. A nice perk. We enjoyed our stay.,10,Rozella,2025-07-13
"From the moment we arrived, everything about The Slate Denver was amazing! The hotel is beautifully designed—our room was super clean, modern, and chic. I love that it’s in a converted old school building—such a cool and unique touch, and the theme carries throughout the entire hotel.

The location is perfect! We were able to walk everywhere—restaurants, dispensaries, and even a Target just a few blocks away. Whether you’re exploring downtown Denver or just looking for a comfy, stylish place to stay, this spot checks all the boxes. Highly recommend!",10,Nicole,2025-07-13

"An interesting building with some nice rooms but service mediocre and just another corporate hotel.  I’d stay again if needing a place to stay with the right price but there are far better more interesting hotels in Denver like the Oxford, Clayton, etc ",6,Dudley,2025-07-11
"Small rooms, certainly for what I paid it was very small. But it was quiet and comfy, right across from the convention center which was great.

"OH EM GEE! This hotel was just SO much more beautiful and interesting in person. The entire property was clean and our room was phenomenal. Check in was easy and all the ladies at the desk were so nice and professional. Breakfast and dinner, each time we went there we were more than satisfied with our meals. The location is prime. 25 min drive to Red Rocks, 16th Street was an easy walk, and so much to look at on the way there AND if that isn’t enough, there was plenty of shopping and eats all up and down the road. The architecture surrounding the hotel was amazing to look at. I could go on and on about how amazing our stay was here. Thank you Slate for having us! We can’t wait to come back!

"We stayed for 4 nights in June 2025 and absolutely loved it.
We are on a months road trip around Colorado and The Slate was our first stop so a great start to the holiday.
We cannot think of anything that the hotel could do better. The room, staff, hotel cleanliness and the restaurant food were all exceptional. Also, only a 5 minute walk to 16th Street was great. We would definitely stay there again, no doubt at all about that.
Well done to all the management and staff",10,Stephen James,2025-07-03

"Great atmosphere. Unique setting (being a renovated school/historical building). Clean rooms. Friendly staff. The valet parking was convenient, but cost prohibitive. We opted for a nearby parking garage and saved nearly 85% ($50 per day) in parking fees alone vs using the hotel's valet. ",8,Bruce,2025-07-01
"The property was beautifully renovated and convenient to Downtown Denver.  I enjoyed my stay and will stay again when visited Denver. The cost of the room was very reasonable!

Hello. My husband and I stayed at The Slate this past Saturday (6/28) and everything was lovely EXCEPT the fan in AC unit started screaming at 2:40am then at 4:45am. We took videos if that's helpful. But we were wondering if you could issue a credit or refund for the inconvenience,4,Kathleen,2025-06-30
Cute old school house that was amazingly transformed into this beautiful hotel.  Great location.  Food was nothing special for what you pay is the only critical feedback we'd give.  ,10,Kyle,2025-06-30
We loved our room at first.  Thought it appeared very clean and nice till we found dead and live cockroaches in our room the day of checkout. Upon check out I told the front desk gal and got “oh sorry”.  Asked for some kind of comp and she said she’d give me $50 off which didn’t happen as I reviewed my emailed receipt.  Now we will need to go through our luggage with a fine tooth comp to make sure we don’t bring cockroaches into our house.  ,4,Sara,2025-06-30

"Definitely expected higher quality for the price and location. Very nice staff. All the paper toiletries (toilet paper, tissues, etc.) were rough like cardboard but super thin and cheap, not even close to a high quality in any way. And water bottles in the room with price tags on them because they are only free if you join their program, just looked cheap and tacky, not hospitable at all. Again, not the vibe I expected from the photos or price for the area. 
The food at the restaurant sounded great, looked great, and tasted terrible. Not good quality food and extremely high prices for what it is. I again expected the spend to be worth it and at least taste good and fresh, instead it was bad and one item was literally rotten inside. 
Nice design and very polite staff, but need to invest more in the products you use and supply to guests. ",8,Heidi,2025-06-30
"I have stayed here with family before. When booking there was no mention of 21+, so when I (18) went to go check in, I felt as if I was getting the short end of the stick.

The property was nice. Small rooms but very comfortable. The only negative I really have is the parking situation. There is parking around the property but most of the parking lots didn’t seem to offer in and out privileges so it almost forces you to do the valet provided by the hotel which was I believe about $70 a day but that said the staff was great as were the valets. ,8,Sean,2025-05-22
This hotel was in a great downtown location. If you are attending an event at the convention center it is literally steps away from the hotel.

"This review could have easily been about The Slate’s commitment to guest satisfaction—but unfortunately, it’s not.

Our stay was disrupted by a loud, continuous rattling noise coming from the vents in our room. It was so jarring and persistent that sleep was impossible. After multiple rounds of this, we contacted the front desk, but it took until the fifth incident—around 2:00 a.m.—to be moved to a new room.

We were surprised to learn there was no maintenance staff on duty overnight, leaving no way to actually resolve the issue in the moment. While we appreciated being moved eventually, the damage was done, most of the night was lost and we woke up exhausted.

We were told we could speak to a manager in the morning about a refund, but no one would meet with us. The hotel offered to waive valet as a gesture, but that felt insufficient considering we didn’t receive the basic service of a restful night.

Things go wrong sometimes—it’s how they’re handled that matters. A sincere, timely response could’ve turned this into a story about great service. Instead, it left us disappointed. The Slate presents itself as a premium property, but in our experience, it didn’t deliver.

Do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere.",2,Kayla,2025-04-08

"Stayed for 4 nights. Hotel doesn’t clearly advertise that some rooms are subgrade. My room had a small window, very high up, due to it being below ground - dungeon chic. I reported that the light filtering blind wasn’t raising and no action was taken. Housekeeping came in and limited their cleaning to making the bed.. didn’t vacuum, wipe down sinks or the glass shower walls, take dirty dishes, etc. The coffee maker was one that had coffee in tea bags, pretty subpar. Bed was quite uncomfortable and room was loud, both from the street and the interior hallway. Staff seemed to know what to say but weren’t actually helpful.. service at the restaurant was extremely slow, despite a high server to customer ratio. No recycling and only a handful of tv channels. Convenient location and has a ton of potential. Tried to call front desk from my room but I just received a busy signal.

"Really nice new hotel three blocks away from the 16th Street Mall.
Built from the shell of the old Emily Griffiths Opportunity School, the interior corridors are unchanged from the school days. 
Rooms are designed and decorated to high standard with huge windows and total blackout drapes. 50inch TV shows live broadcast shows as well as access to all streaming services. Pod coffee maker and a very useful hand steamer are also at hand.. 
Shower room is tiled ceiling to floor with high end shampoo and body lotions provided. 
Not the not so great. My room looked out onto a strip club with neon lights pulsing all night..... thank goodness for the blackout drapes. The area is pretty sketchy but it is on the up - walking up past the Denver Athletics Club and the shuttered businesses to get to the commercial centre can be pretty daunting after dark. 
Plus, your credit/debit card will be charged $150 at check in for 'incidentals'. It will be returned within 2 weeks after check out minus any spend. As there's no minibar in the room, I'm still wondering what the 'incidentals' are..... just checked out this morning, so I'm unable to verify whether the two week return is right.

"Stayed here over Valentine’s Day weekend. Upon arrival we found out that we had to pay for parking (Valet) or use the street meters. You may have to walk a couple blocks if you want cheaper parking. Surrounding lots are also pretty expensive for overnight. The area itself is super central which was convenient. 

The hotel itself is decorated nicely. It’s an old school and I really liked how they kept some of those elements. There is a little convenience area, bar and restaurant inside the property. 

Our room was nice, a bit on the smaller side but it worked for us. Linens were incredible to the point that we are ordering the same pillows we had during our stay! Bathroom/shower was also remarkable. The rain shower head really provided a relaxing touch after being in the cold all day. The TV in our room only had a select number of smart tv apps (no Max, Prime, Hulu or Disney , only Netflix, YouTube and Tubi) but there was cable. I did enjoy the fact that I could control the tv with my Hilton app. There was a nice fridge along with a clothes steamer, hair dryer and when asked for an extra blanket it was very soft and king size. Overall, this is a great place to stay. ",8,Andreya Ellen,2025-02-19

The hotel was formerly a vocational school and I loved the vibes. The rooms were comfortable and the location was really convenient. My only concern was the cost of valet (almost $60/day). Quite steep so I was very glad I didn’t drive. The cost of an Uber to downtown was very affordable. I will stay here again!,10,Julia,2025-02-18

My main reason for not giving 5 stars is we paid extra for a corner room but we didn't think/realize the corner room could be at the ground level.  I don't think people could see into our room but we had multiple people lean against the windows and displaying bodily functions you probably don't want to see while relaxing.  Something to keep in mind if you like privacy and you are a light sleeper.,6,Kate,2024-09-09

"We were SO impressed by The Slate! Formerly a school, the building is unique, the stairwells are awesome, and the hallways are wide. More importantly, our room was extremely clean, with high ceilings, nice bedding, new furnishings, and a luxurious feel. The lobby and front porch areas are also very chic. Our kids (11 and 13) liked that there was corn hole and bocce ball outside, and board games inside the lobby. The employees at the front desk and at the restaurant were all very kind and considerate. The restaurant food was good (we tried breakfast and dinner). The valet-only parking is expensive, but it’s covered, secure and convenient. There was plenty of street parking though, and we only needed to use the valet once during our stay, because the street sweepers were coming early the next morning. We hope to stay here again next time we’re in Denver! ",10,Jenny,2024-09-03

Our room was very tiny but it was comfortable. We only stayed the night as we had attended a concert.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Valet parking is the way to go!

"Uns wurde ein Zimmer gegeben, dass direkt neben einem Mitarbeitereingang war. Diese Türe konnte man Tag und Nacht hören. Ich bin mir sicher, das Hotel weiss um diesen Mangel bei diesem Zimmer. Trotzdem wird es vergeben. Das ist für mich ein No-Go, sorry. Zumal es das Zimmer doch seinen Preis pro Nacht hat. Bei der Bitte um ein anderes Zimmer, wurden wir auf den Nachmittag vertröstet. Immerhin hat es dann am Abend geklappt mit einem ruhigeren Zimmer. Aber das Personal an der Rezeption könnte freundlicher und entgegenkommender sein.

The hotel canceled the whole reservation on the first day as a ""no show,"" then made us pay again for the two remaining days, saying we'd need to talk to Expedia about getting a refund. Expedia didn't receive the money, so this is a total scam. it is completely unfair to charge again for a room we had already booked. It's outrageous.",2,Ross,2024-07-28

They have renovated What was a school that was built I believe in the 50s. The creativity in the design and the choices chosen sets this property apart from others. I love the room atmosphere of the main floor restaurant had great food choices. That were very good.,10,Michael,2024-06-22

"This hotel is a good value for downtown Denver; we walked to the Museum of Art and the US Mint, and the Union Station area can be accessed by the free Mall Ride bus. Our room was very nicely appointed,  though very small. There were no actual glasses or coffee mugs in the room, only disposable paper cups, which we thought was strange for a 4-star hotel. The lobby was very noisy with a heavy, loud door slamming constantly when employees went in and out of the reception area. We enjoyed the old school vibe with the cute decorations and hallways reminiscent of your high school. Overall, pretty nice!",8,Sarah,2024-06-21
"Property was perfectly clean, area was walkable. Only thing I was not a fan of was the refillable bottles for toiletries. Just makes me a bit uncomfy using stuff that anyone can open.... 

In terms of parking, they have valet parking for around $50 a night, or there is street parking locally which is free after 10 pm ($2 an hour) or surface lots just round the corner for $30. 
Their valet parking is convenient, as you are given a QR code to order your car so you can do it from your room!",10,Roslyn,2024-06-21

"Good hotel! Downtown Denver is not very fun this time of the year though. The 16th streeet market is under renovation. Securities patrolling the streets. 

However, this hotel is in a quieter street and is a be better and safer place to stay in downtown Denver. 

When staying, ask for second floor or up. Their first floor is technically a basement. Kinda cold. ",8,Zehua,2024-06-20

The schoolhouse was a brilliant idea. All the staff has been amazing. The grounds and rooms are VERY clean. The restaurant is also very good and reasonably priced.

"Great experience. From check-in to departure, I had a wonderful stay. The room was clean, comfortable and very modern. The ‘school’ tropes are a little overplayed but cheeky enough to be charming. I really enjoyed the open lobby/restaurant and bar area…the gym in the basement is well appointed and clean. There’s plenty of public parking nearby…the cheapest lot is immediately south of the building at $15 a night, very affordable. 

I would definitely recommend the Slate and plan to stay again, next time I’m in Denver. ",10,Eric,2024-06-14

We finally had time to have a drink in the hotel bar our most recent stay and were not disappointed! Our bartender made some very tasty drinks and was fun to talk with. I'm hoping we have time during our next visit to have dinner here as well, the food we saw going out to other tables looked and smelled fantastic.

"Pretty fun to stay in what was once a school (googling the history of it is worth the read). An easy, quick walk across the street to Bellco Theatre where our concert was. Food in hotel was delicious (although they might consider more staff as the wait was a half hour despite empty tables). We stayed on the bottom floor and had a very LARGE unwelcome bug crawl under the door to come visit us but we were not in the mood for guests so he met the bottom of a boot and then took a swim down the very clean toilet. And speaking of the bathroom, I spent an unusual amount of time in there reading the walls as the wallpaper was made up of old newspaper articles, which was interesting. Overall very cool vibe and great location. Would totally stay here again (except on a higher floor to hopefully avoid uninvited pests, lol).",8,amanda,2024-05-18

Thirdly , overheard housekeeper asking the house keeper supervisor “are there black people staying in this room” while they were cleaning not knowing I was in the bathroom,
 When confronted manager was literally trying too put us out of the entire hotel, 
trip was on all ruined , definitely will not ever stay here @ Denver Slate Hotel again, this being the 3rd time I stayed here & this happening is crazy , guess cause the new management I noticed , don’t recommend this hotel property too anyone ",2,Larry,2024-01-30

The guy checking me in said I could hang up because he found my reservation. There was no offer to call on my behalf, no apology, no welcoming feeling whatsoever. Instead, I was told- ""you can go wait over there while I prepare your reservation"". I waited again, only to be yelled at across the way "" You can come back now"".

"I stayed at The Slate Denver for one night and really enjoyed the experience. I have taken a lot of trips in my day and I have never stayed at a hotel that used to be a school. So cool! You can see the remnants of the building's old purpose with the wide brick hallways. The theme is seen throughout the hotel. 

The staff was friendly and everything went smoothly. I had breakfast at the hotel's restaurant, Teacher's Lounge, and it was a five-star experience. The croque madame sandwich I had was one of the best I've had in my life. If you've never had this delectable sandwich, it's with cheese, ham, bechamel sauce, and an egg on top. I also got a side of potatoes and everything was perfect. Check it out while you're there. 

As far as areas of improvement, the room was a bit small. And no microwave in the room. Small points as this was an excellent stay. The little things count and they do that here. When I arrived to my room, they had my name on the TV screen and it said ""welcome."" Check them out next time you're in Denver!",10,Vlad,2024-01-20
I brought my wife with me to Denver for a work trip and decided to stay at the Slate by Hilton. I have to say it was the best decision we made.  The property is so clean and the staff are all so nice. We don’t want this trip to be over and will definitely be back to stay at this property again. Thank you Hilton this property definitely did not let us down. ,10,Dallin,2024-01-19

This property was unlike any other hotels I’ve stayed in. Such a cute and clean building. This building used to be an old school house so there is lots of character you won’t find at another hotel. Only 4 floors so it was not super busy. Staff was very friendly and helped with all the questions and services that were needed! Will stay again! ,10,Erica,2024-01-16

"It was fabulous!! I would stay here again for sure, the only downfalls were that it was way too hot inside the lobby, halls, and room. In the room we had to turn the a/c on to cool it down some, in the middle of winter! The other downfall was the weird noises in the walls of piping clanking or something? It kept us up for a part of the night both nights we stayed. Otherwise, this hotel delivered big time! The restaurant was delicious and the had excellent staff and excellent cocktails!

Staff is extra friendly compared to other places.  My only complaint was I booked a king, and they checked me in to two queens.  They didn't inform me at check-in.  I only discovered this when I went to the room.  When I called the front desk, they informed me they had no king rooms.  I had paid extra for an upgraded room. ",10,Paul,2023-12-20

The attention to detail, the ultra modern decor, the comfort, the wide corridors with lots of space, the excellent service, the great food and drinks, the wonderful location, the heated patio. I tried hard to think of something that could be improved but it was a perfect stay. What I liked most was that my partner and I came with a friend. It was cold outside and this was the perfect place to hang. We spent more time here than in any other hotel I've stayed in, just because it was such a pleasant place to be. 10/10.

"Even though we prepaid for breakfast they were reluctant to give us vouchers and then they said they were being nice by giving us two because only one traveler was listed. I double checked my booking and it was for two travelers with breakfast bar. But they don't have a breakfast bar like in the photos, it is a standard menu. The room was beautiful and clean, but the pillows were flat and hard and the hot water ran out in the middle of a shower. Definitely not what I was expecting from a 9/10 reviewed hotel. It was close to DCPA and a lot of other activities which we appreciated. It is an awesome use for an old historic building. Parts of the building smelled very bad.",8,Verified traveler,2023-12-18

Kudos to the staff from the cleaning crew to the front desk folks. Keep up the good work! 
My only issue with it is the expensive valet parking, but in return, you are in a central location. Close to the 16th street Mall for some food and some cheap parking places are nearby if the price is also a barrier.

The restaurant (sit down and bar) had excellent food and drinks, including beet salad and sweet potato gnocchi. Once again, staff were attentive and engaging. Bartender (Cole) was helpful with service and finding NHL Network to watch Wild play Global Series early morning. 

Hotel has multiple seating areas to relax, including outdoor seating with heated patio. 

Room was on smaller side, but cleanliness, thoughtful features (storage/bed drawers), rain shower, and comfortable seating made up for it. 

Hotel is close to 16th Street Mall and located in a walkable area.

"This is a lovely hotel in a former school, which has been fully renovated. The hotel is clean, schick, and spacious. It is perhaps the most intriguing hotel in which I have stayed. We had a corner room on the 4th floor, with a Mountain view. The room was comfortable. If not for the following experience, I would have rated The Slate at a 5 out of 5. On the first day during which we requested housekeeping, we returned to the room to find the following: someone had entered the room (a fact confirmed by management), moved one of my items, dropped a pill on the bathroom floor, put “Do not disturb” hangtag on the door, and left the room without servicing it. Upon reporting the matter to management, they pulled a log of the key card swipes on the door and confirmed that a housekeeper had entered the room but stated that “nothing out of the ordinary” happened. This very uncomfortable experience, coupled with management’s apparent dismissive response, gives me pause and makes me hesitant to recommend this hotel to others. That’s a shame, because it truly is an adorable hotel. ",6,Julia,2023-10-19

The fact that it is an old school converted to a hotel and Hilton went with the theme of the school is pretty sharp. ,8,Michel,2023-08-22
The building renovation was really cool; converting an old school into hotels rooms and keeping that schoolhouse theme was really unique. Small rooms but it was all we needed for an overnight in Denver. The bar had delicious cocktails and still served food at 10p. The Sunday brunch service was a bit slow but the food was good. ,10,Anthony,2023-08-21

Very nice and large property. Room was adequate and very clean. The Bartender was awesome and very friendly. Checkin was a breeze and there is valet parking on site. But it’s 54.00 a night which I thought might be a little high. But I don’t valet very often so maybe it’s a good deal. Otherwise there is parking elsewhere not on the property and I didn’t feel it was convenient and it still would cost money. So I chose to do the valet. ,10,Ryan,2023-08-13

The bar/restaurant in the hotel was great for a nightcap or even to just stay in and drink.  The staff at this location is very professional & kind.  They always greet us upon arrival and when leaving. I will stay here again if I'm ever in the area.  ",10,Raquel De,2023-08-08
"We were in room 103. The hallway reeked like sewage. When I told the front desk and the solution was to have room service spray some Lysol. Additionally, our room was never serviced and there was a ton of street noise. ",4,Kaileen,2023-08-08

"Very nice accommodations however, a few things that could be improved. The toilet seat kept falling over to the side whenever I sat down. The lights in the bathroom are on a motion sensor which I can appreciate but when showering, it didn't sense motion and kept turning the lights off. I had to keep opening and shutting the shower door to get them to turn back on. Also the TV didn't work but they sent maintenance to our room right away and we though it was fixed but it wasn't. We were so tired at that point we just asked them to come back the next day while we were out. They got it working the next day. ",6,Jennifer,2023-08-07

"Our bag was stolen off the front entryway of this hotel.  Hotel management was not forthcoming with video to see what happened to it that evening. Also very uncooperative with how to file a police report or get police involved. Had to wait until next morning to view video when day manager was present. Then video was “buffering” at time of incident so no details - bag was there and then it wasn’t. Other cameras were not working to be able to see other angles. Hotel management never acknowledged shortcomings or frankly even sympathetic about situation. At a minimum, they could have offered complimentary toiletries!!! Very disappointing customer service along with security.  Not what i would expect from a Hilton. ",2,Ann,2023-07-29

"A complete renovation of an old trade school done brilliantly. Other than the restaurant name, The Teacher's Lounge, and the old stairwells which were left in tact for effect and were behind glass doors, you would never know.  The exterior is also original.  Rooms are smaller but wonderfully done and completely equipped with great beds and bathrooms.",10,Steven,2023-07-26
"This is a one year old hotel in a school building originally built in 1956. My room was extremely quiet. It is a brick building and I suspect many of the interior walls are brick as well. 

There were a number of nice features in the room, including ceiling lighting.  There was a work desk and plenty of plugs for electronics. There was no tub in my room but a large shower stall with a nice overhead shower head about 7' high, so no leaning over....

The hotel is officially on Welton Street, but the entrance is actually in a plaza on 13th Street between Welton and Glenarm. (The back of the hotel is on Welton with no entrance there.) It is only one block further from the 16th Street mall  (three blocks total) than most of the other hotels in the area, but there are multiple parking garages for the nearby convention center in the last block, which males it feel a bit isolated. I would suggest pedestrians walk down Glenarm  instead which is a livelier street with the Denver Athletic Club on it around the corner.
",10,William,2023-07-25
"My only complaint is that the elevators were down, but I suppose a little exercise never hurt anyone. Valet rate is $54/night. Pricey, but not any higher than other hotel valet prices in the area.

"This property is so unique.  The school theme really honors the history of this building.  The staff are great and the building was fun to walk around.  The location was walkable to shopping and restaurants.  The train was close by if you wanted to use mass transit.  For longer trips, the city has tons of electric bikes and scooters to rent.  Parking at the hotel is a bit steep, but a less expensive option is less than a block away.  It’s less secure but cost has its trade offs.  The restaurant here has great food and drinks.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  I have no complaints other than some minor cleanliness issues ( minor stains on the bedding and inside the trash can).  I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Denver.",10,Scott,2023-07-14

"The hotel is really nice and was great to stay at. Our room had a nice view of the Rockies. If you are going to be doing something at the Convention Center this is the hotel for you. Also if you are going to visit the U.S. Mint it’s only about a 5 minute walk. The 16th Street Mall takes about 10-12 minutes to get to. However, if you are going to a Rockies game it is about a 30 minute walk so consider that. They offer breakfast but it’s pretty expensive for what they offer. The prices at the Teachers Lounge, as a whole, are expensive and was the reason we chose to eat elsewhere. Overall though I would most definitely stay here again if I ever return to Denver.",10,Nannette,2023-06-30

"Hilton clearly put a lot of thought and resources into renovating this old boarding school. The staff were incredibly friendly, the public spaces are ample and very well appointed, and the full-service bar and restaurant were convenient and better than you would expect for a hotel at this price point. The location is a little off the beaten path behind the convention center though the theater district and 16th St. are only four blocks away and public transport is not far. The rooms were quiet, away from street traffic or noise from other rooms; these walls are solid construction blocks, not drywall.

The only negative is the size of the sleeping rooms. The king bed and bathroom were wonderful; there wasn’t room for much else. A small, open armoire had only one drawer for clothes; we ended up hoisting our empty suitcases on top of it because there was no place else to put them. A bit like a dressed up Eurotel with more amenities.

"Hotel ran by stoned teenagers...

Honestly disappointed with this experience. The hotel wouldn't work with me to adjust my reservation because I booked it through Expedia (and Expedia said there's nothing they can do, and to talk to the hotel). All I wanted to do was move everything forward one night.

I check in to my room, put my stuff away, and walk into the bathroom to find what looked like pubic hair all over the back of the toilet. The front desk goes ""oh sorry about that..."" like it's commonplace...I get to my next room and there was weed chocolate and a container of yellow liquid in the fridge. 

Just Busch League all around.",6,Brandon,2023-01-20
