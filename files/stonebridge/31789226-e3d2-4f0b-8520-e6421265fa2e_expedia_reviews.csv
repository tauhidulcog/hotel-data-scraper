"Das Hotel befindet sich Downtown im Financial District von Manhattan und bietet daher den bestmöglichen Startpunkt um Manhattan von Downtown aus zu erkunden. Es ist sauber, die Zimmer sind für New Yorker Verhältnisse von der Größe her völlig ausreichend. Man braucht es in dieser Stadt sowieso nur zum Schlafen. Preislich liegt das Hotel absolut im erträglichen Rahmen. Wir können uns nicht beklagen. Es war ein super Aufenthalt. Absolut empfehlenswert. ",8,Alexander,2025-10-04

"The room was very small for three people, it had no fridge and lacked proper ventilation. The telephone in the room did not work which was very inconvenient. 

We were not notified of a planned fire alarm which was scary for us as we were very high up. It just highlighted a real lack of communication across teams within the hotel. Some of the receptionist staff were unhelpful at times especially when we asked to stow our suitcases away in the storage room. We were not supported when bringing down our luggage from the room and the trolley we were given was faulty which made the whole process unnecessarily arduous.

The front desk staff were incredibly kind and helpful, making us feel welcome from the very first moment. The rooms were beautifully kept, very clean, and comfortable.

We stayed in a room across from a very loud machine in the hall that never turned off. Our lights in the room wouldn’t turn off on first night so the engineer unplugged them as a resolution and we had no light the rest of the trip. The phone went off constantly beeping the entire time we were there…also none of the restaurants were family friendly. ,4,Dana,2025-09-09

"The hotel is located in financial district in a high traffic area. Staff was very accommodating and went out of the way to assist with every request we made. Transport and dining are in abundance. Though the area is noisy this doesn’t affect you once inside the hotel. The most you may hear is traffic in the distance.
The area surrounding the hotel is not great, restaurants and businesses dump garbage on the sidewalk. It reeks of smell of garbage, sometimes urine. There is scaffolding on most sidewalks which means stepping onto the road at times.",10,Suzette,2025-09-08

Sin embargo, si hay que andar con precaución ya que afuera del hotel existe una área de esparcimiento pero por lo general la usan las personas para fumar principalmente marihuana y el olor es muy fuerte e incómodo, en lo particular no me gusta. Habrá a quienes si les guste y p",6,Maria Elena,2025-09-04

Could not swing a cat in the room. Nowhere to put suitcase in room. Air conditioning noisy. Staff were great and very helpful. ,6,Joseph,2025-09-03
I went to this hotel because close to an exam I was taking. The price was very good for what you get. I did not get the breakfast because pricier than the food nearby. The only thing I don’t like was the lighting in the hotel room. So dark and gloomy. Could barely see my books and laptop. I turned on all the lights. Overall was a good experience. Night life and good food around the area.,8,Andrew,2025-09-02

"The rooms were very clean and modern and the beds were plush and comfortable.  I just wish the rooms were larger with a little more space.  The double bed room like the one I stayed in was pretty compact and small.  Also, the outside area in front of the hotel didn’t look as nice in person as in the photo and there was work being done across the street on a tall building which led to some noise from the construction.  All in all the hotel was nice, but the surrounding area was not so appealing as it was surrounded by tall buildings.",8,Ida,2025-08-23
"The location is excellent, very convenient and close to the subway, which made getting around easy. The room was clean and tidy, which I appreciated. However, the bed was a major drawback. It was squeaky and even collapsed, which was unheard of. They did come up to fix it temporarily during bedtime, but couldn’t fully fixed it until the next day. ",8,Joanne,2025-08-22

"It was the perfect location for us, close to tons of stuff and all the transportation outlets. For the price paid, it worked out well. But the room was small, and the beds were barely full size. My wife and I are slim, so we made it work. But a couple with more meat on their bones would find it completely unworkable. The cleaning staff was top notch and check-in was a breeze. I'd stay again if it was just the two of us (our college aged daughter was with us) and we could get a king room, or even a queen would be nice.",8,John,2025-08-18

"We were four persons stying in the room with two double beds. It was ok but probably too small for other people who need more space. 

The room was clean, however in the bathroom you clearly could see the age of the hotel. 

The air conditioner was working good, but was really noisy. The windows did not insulate all of the street noise. We were in the 7th floor.

Room cleaning was very good without any complaints.

Checkout time at 12:00 was also very positive for us.

At the morning there was free coffee at the lobby available and it tasted good.",8,Anton,2025-08-17

The staff were friendly and the room was quiet and clean, and the water pressure in the shower was great. I’d stay again.",10,Katri,2025-08-13

Great location! Rooms were clean and nice. My one complaint is the elevators. They are so slow and only 2 of 3 work. Typically waiting for the elevators (and stopping on every floor to pick up/drop off other guests) would add at least 10-15 minutes onto our commute. ,8,Kayla,2025-08-11

"Stayed here for a concert at the pier at rooftop 17 - fantastic. Walking view which was great. Hotel was nice - room was on the smaller side but good for a night or two. After concert we wanted to check out the rooftop bar which was at occupancy so we couldn’t get in so they suggested we go check out the bar on the second floor. That was also packed so we went to the lobby restaurant. We sat at the bar and it was a fantastic choice - quiet, excellent drinks (thanks Reggie) and food was good! Major issues with the elevators. Long line every time we had to go on them - only had 2 elevators working for 29 floors. Kinda crazy ",8,Emily,2025-08-10

"The bed was fine, probably the best part of the room. The location was good, very walkable, plenty of great restaurants and subway options nearby. The front desk people were great.

The bad parts? Mold in the showers, broken elevators (part of the button panel was literally falling off), and a sewage smell in the lobby. Very low-quality hotel that I won't be staying in again.",4,Philip,2025-08-06

What a place and for a reasonable place the subway is three streets away depending on which one you want to hop on. Joes pizza and two bros is near by for a quick slice. The nightlife is also in the same hotel. ,10,Jose,2025-07-31
"The property itself was not bad despite all the construction. The noise disturbance was really from one of the cafes nearby that played music until 3 AM on the weekend. I notified the front desk that the air conditioning was not working properly. It was necessary to go to the front desk to report it because the phone in the room was not working. In an attempt to notify the front desk I called the reservations number but still had to go to the front desk for help. The customer service rep who answered to the phone call transferred me to someone else who became sarcastic when I inquired if it was possible to get access to a secure wifi. The wifi at this hotel is public access so no password is required, but I was afraid my laptop would be hacked. The rep to whom I had been transferred said only mean, evil people would be concerned about it! The staff at the front desk tried to be helpful but no engineering service is available after 8 PM so I had to live with the poor air conditioning and no phone service (so I couldn't reach the front desk by phone). It took 2 days for engineering to tend to the complaint because no one had notified them. ",4,Priscilla,2025-07-30

"We booked this hotel at the last minute after seeing terrible reviews for the VRBO we initially booked for the trip. The staff was so accommodating, the hotel room was clean and comfortable, and the location was fabulous. The onsite dining locations could use an update- for example the rooftop bar was less rooftop bar and more fake flowers decorating an outdoor lounge/club atmosphere. Not really the vibe we were going for, and we saw another family walk in and promptly walk out again as well. But other than that, we had no complaints. ",10,Marina,2025-07-15

We stayed here because our connecting flight home was canceled. We were exhausted and just needed a shower and a good nights sleep. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. I don’t normally stay in this area when I come to NYC. There wasn’t a lot of restaurants to choose from close to the hotel. The staff were friendly. They helped get us a cab to the airport the following morning.,10,Carol,2025-07-06

"The rooms were not ready at the designated check-in time and we had to wait over 45 minutes past that time to receive them. The staff was notably unfriendly throughout the experience—there was no apology for the delay, and despite my request to be shown the hotel amenities, this was neither acknowledged nor followed up on once the room was ready. 

Additionally, the staff member at the entrance charged my card for a security deposit without any explanation of the amount or what it covered. There was essentially no effort to provide any kind of service or orientation.

That said, the hotel itself is okay. The rooms were a bit smaller than what you'd typically expect from a 4-star hotel in New York, but otherwise decent.

The elevators were also insufficient for the size of the hotel. They often took a long time to arrive, and when they did, they were frequently already full, making it frustrating and time-consuming to get to and from the room.

"My friend and I stayed in a 2 full bed room.  This was a fun girl's trip.  Overall, would stay there again, but ask early on for a fridge for the room!

Pro:  Clean (both bedroom, bathroom, beds, sheets).  Location was ideal and near bus stops.  Bed was very comfortable.  Service was great, people were very friendly.  Check in and check out process was very easy.  Check out time was amazing! 

Con:  Pillows were not as comfortable.  We tried to call down to the front desk a couple times to ask questions, and the phone in the room did not work.  It kept going to a busy signal and after we reported it and they ""worked on it"", it just stopped working.  Luckily, we did not really need anything, but if we did, we would have to go all the way down to the main lobby to talk to the front desk.  They even gave us a business card with the number to call if there were issues, and we kept getting a busy signal from that as well.  No refrigerator.  We asked if they had one, and the front desk stated it was a ""first come, first served"" type of amenity.  It would have been nice to have a place to keep our bottles of water cold.

They had to come and fix that. My room was across from the Lining closet and the staff was in there until almost 5am laughing, talking loudly, and kept slamming doors. I had to call the front desk to get security up stairs to stop the nonsense. The water was off from 11am until 3pm for maintenance. They did give me a flyer under my door letting the people know. The toilet would not flush. They had to come and fix that. There were too many issues going on to have paid that much for the rooms that I paid for.

"I saw the add on expedia that breakfast is complimentary just like two water bottles. However, at check in, I was told that breakfast is NOT included in my plan. I don't know what plan because I saw breakfast in the list that convinced me to book this hotel ahead of several options. Why doesn't expedia page mentioned it explicitly during reservation? This is absurd and I am not going to make reservations from Expedia anymore !!! Also, there was no mini refrigerator either that does not matter. I traveled so far so and paid $100 for a room that does not provide a breakfast is not acceptable especially when every other hotel in the list shows free breakfast. It is literally embarrassing to hear that from the staff at reception having a big crowd...    I am still feeling uncomfortable...   It was a lie/ deceit so that we use expedia platform for reservations, even I paid in advance on expedia and not at the hotel desk when I had the option. ",6,Mohammad Zohaib,2025-02-25

It was a pricy hotel in a nice are wiht lots of to walk to and easy access to public transportation. However hotel has NO parking we had to pay 62 dollars a day to park and parking is limited in the area. Bathroom was not as clean as it should be, and for being a 10 hotel. They were limited on TP and other things. I also found a bug in the coffee pot in the room so we did not use that and i went for free coffe downstairs ( i recommend).  Overal it was just an ok stay.

"The stay was not good . Upon entry I was given no complimentary items for example such as tooth paste , tooth brush or mouthwash as the individuals before me did . I contact the front desk to acquire a room with a tub due to me being disabled before my reservation date they confirmed my request via my email/message and then I am given a room with no tub. There was barely if any at all heat in the unit as well. Upon check out , front desk representative were extremely unpleasant , ignored me as I waited to be helped and then proceed to not be helpful but to be rude. Ultimately I will most likely not be staying at any more of these properties. The property had numerous “ fire safety alarm drills” in which alarms would ring off at around 9:30 am with a ridiculous amount of noise and no regard. My partner is epileptic and that was a major issue and disregard for her safety . We kept getting stuck in the elevator . That would constantly take us to floors we did not request or would just go to the top floor with the door refusing to open. I was also given a conjoined room in which I did not ask for or request nor was I informed that I would ultimately pay for a room I did not get as well as no soap in the bathroom or conditioner and little shampoo. This was unacceptable again for the price being charged . ",2,Verified traveler,2025-01-16

The hotel location was perfect for our family. A 2 minute walk away from the subway station (Fulton Street) and a 5 minute walk to the World Trade Centre Memorial / One World Observatory. The location was perfect as it was away from the hustle and chaos of Time Square around Christmas time.

"We booked a bedroom with 2 queen beds and we got 2 twin beds.  We were changed to a King bed   roller bed room, but the roller bed mattress was useless, old, impossible to sleep on, coils were sticking out. We were given a new mattress and we were OK then. The elevators were old, inefficient, insufficient to move all guests, I had to wait 15 minutes in the Lower Lobby to get one, I finally decided to go up the stairs. The hotel is not what you see in the Expedia photos",6,JORGE,2024-12-10
"This hotel is close enough to the train station to get around the area. The check in process was smooth but the person at the front desk was very unfriendly almost bordering on rude. They do not answer the phones when you are calling from the room either. It is close to some very good restaurants. There is a rooftop bar but you have to make reservations as it is not part of the hotel. The bathroom was spacious, the room is not spacious at all. A bit tight but that’s NYC for you. The room was clean and coffee and tea was available from 7 am to 10am. I would stay here again. ",6,neisha,2024-12-10

Nice hotel at reasonable prices. Rooms are showing a bit age like wallpaper peeling off. The shower curtain was too short too resulting in water flooding the bathroom floor. Staff were friendly and the dining and rooftop bar were nice. The second floor restaraunt was closed and I wish there was some indication that it wasn’t open. I’d recommend if you’re looking for a nicer budget room. If you want a more luxurious stay then I would look elsewhere. ,8,Brian,2024-12-04

"The hotel has gone way down. It starts with the front courtyard of the hotel where you'll find lots of homeless and drug activity in a filthy space. 

Our 5 night stay was ruined by 2 nights of lack of sleep due to screaming kids, slamming doors and banging on the walls. Construction all over the area means non stop banging, drilling and hammering. One night they allowed a 3:30 am check in who must have been drunk because of the noise I called front desk no answer, then the main number no answer as well. Finally at 4 am  I went to the front desk and was told they could do nothing!! 

I spoke to staff who also said they could and would do nothing! Are you kidding me!!!

The rooftop is also a hookah bar that attracts interesting people. It's hardly upscale or nice.

Our stay was nice and the staff were generally friendly. I did feel at times that some of the front desk were a bit snappy at us but overall it was fine. The only thing that was not working in our room was the TV - we asked the front desk if anything could be done to fix it so that we could at least have our Netflix working but they said these errors occur sometimes and that the best they could do is leave a note that it wasn't working. ,8,Siddhi,2024-11-25

There is a public courtyard that would allow the occasional vigrant- there was one in particular that made me feel unsafe at night. The walls were very thin but the bed was comfortable & clean.

Initially, I was told no other rooms were available, but after some discussion, I was moved to another room. Unfortunately, the second room's air conditioning wasn't working on the first night, leaving the room uncomfortably warm and barely getting any sleep the first night. The air conditioning was not fixed until 11 am on the second day. Overall, a less-than-ideal experience! ",4,Jessica,2024-11-04

Minor thing, we have had severe issues with payments as overcharging occurred and we still have not gotten our money back and they just ask us to wait.

Room was very small and looked tired looking (peeling wallpaper etc), but bed was big and comfy which is all we really needed. Daily housekeeping with fresh towels and bottles of water which was handy. Free daily coffee/tea in the lobby area. We tried the breakfast on our first morning, and it was dreadful. Barely anything to choose from. Would definitely advise going else where. Had heard there were noise issues, however we didn't have any issues with this where our room was located. Good location- 5 min to Fulton St subway and 10 mins to Wall Street, Brooklyn Bridge. There are 2 food markets near by for snacks etc. Overall, we had an amazing time in New York!

"We made reservation for 3 rooms/3 people for 5 nights, from overseas, counting on the option the cash payment was acceptable. However, when we arrived at the hotel we were asked credit card deposit for the whole amount, which was a problem for us because the amount was high. We asked for other options but the manager was not helpful and insisted that a credit card with the whole limit should be physically there. After a few hours of arguments it turned out that i) debit card was also ok, and ii) credit card authorization was also ok; meaning that a credit card was did not need to be physically presented. We think that the manager was incompetent about the procedures and was not willing to cooperate, which put us in a very difficult position at arrival. ",4,OSMAN SELCUK,2024-10-03

Fue muy mala experiencia. Se encuentra afuera en construcción y una grúa moviendo cosas. Súper peligroso. Hay 3 elevadores pero junto con la gente sube el servicio y no cabíamos. Nos dieron un cuarto enfrente de la obra era súper ruidoso el viernes. El sábado no trabajaron. No fue posible dormir por más que reportamos que los vecinos tenían la tele a todo volumen eran gritos toda la noche. La segunda noche les llamaron para pedir silencio pero aún así se oían los gritos. Había una puerta entre ambos cuartos. El lobby es muy incómodo y no está bien ocupado. Muy mal hotel no lo recomiendo,2,Verified traveler,2024-09-22

Morale della favola il pagamento addebitato è stato uno, quello più basso del secondo giorno, ma sulla carta di credito l’importo addebitato erroneamente è rimasto caricato (anche se non incassato ma di fatto non stornato) e quindi va a fare monte sul plafond della carta.",8,Vanessa,2024-08-27

"I booked a stay here for a week business trip and was highly disappointed. From the moment I walked into the room, it smelled of mold and the bathroom had black mold in each corner. There were flies and roaches found in the room. The door lock latch was broken. There is loud construction right outside of the window so I couldn’t open the shades or workers would be able to look right in. When I asked the front desk agent to move rooms, she seems dismissive and said they were full and I had no other options but to stay put until the next day, the next day I asked again and I got the same response. Finally after 3 days, I spoke to a manager who was willing to move me rooms but by then, the damage was done and I was over it. I requested a refund for the rest of my trip and checked out early.

"A comfortable hotel close to the Brooklyn Bridge.
Go for an early morning coffee on one of the docks while viewing the waterfront and watching the boats go by. 
A great location in the financial district with easy access to other areas of the city by subway and much more. This hotel is a hidden gem.  We were thrilled with the room.  The staff was extremely helpful with any questions we had and the room was very clean. (the bed was very comfortable for a good nights sleep)",10,Steven,2024-06-30
Great hotel and great services ,10,ryan,2024-06-30
"The hotel is conveniently located near various subway stations. There are plenty of restaurants and stores around for food. Places in the Financial District are within walking distance.

The hotel is nice and comfortable. I sometimes needed to wait for an elevator for a while (there are three), but never for too long. There is construction going on around the hotel, but it did not bother me in terms of noise.

The room and bed were comfortable as well. The room was very quiet. There is no fridge in the room, which I really would have liked to have. The air-conditioning worked fine, however, it was very loud, and once on it blowed very hard towards the bed. I believe I developed a cough due to the AC (which I also couldn't turn off or the room would've become unbearably hot).

The TV can be connected to streaming services, though it locks you out every time you turn off the TV, after which you have to turn the TV on AND then restart it once more before you can log back in. I understand this is to keep my crefentials safe, but it's also annoying. The TV also turned off automatically after a certain number of hours, and then you had to play the log in game again.

I noticed a bit of black mold in the bathroom. The shiwer dried quite slowly, which probably helps the mold to grow. Maybe the walls also aren't washed (and dried) properly.

I would stay here again despite these few negative things. ",8,Verified traveler,2024-06-29

Our stay in this hotel was really good except that the bad making was way too late. On the second day when we came back to our room at  around 3pm the bed making girl was about to start cleaning our room. We were all tired waking around the town on that day but were forced to wait outside the building till the bed making was done. It was the same next day.  In addition the bed making girl did not speak English and had to talk to the manager(?) that the bed making was way too late so we did not need it for the day. Don't get me wrong our overall experience in this hotel was as good as I can recommend someone to choose this hotel.    ,8,Yusuke,2024-06-28

Only gripe I had with the bed was that the bed frame was atop a metal base with sharp edges at the base plus the frame was held together by clasps which jutted out! I had the unfortunate incident of grazing against it twice wand caused a cut both times. I’ve mentioned to the front desk and the lady apologised and said she will notify the management about it. Besides that the rooms were small, I guess it’s expected from what I read so it’s acceptable. Requesting room cleaning and also extra drinking bottled water was done efficiently.

"We normally stay up by Grand Central but decided to stay in the financial  district to try it out.  1st off,  our room was tiny! I mean European size tiny. But the front desk staff is great! We requested a car for our ride back to the hotel after the game and they set it right up.  When we wanted to change the time they also helped right out.  The cleaning staff did a good job but they didn't show up until between 4-5 which was very inconvenient.  Housekeeping really should be done in the morning after the guest leaves for the day,  at least in my opinion.  The bed could use more pillows and the HVAC was broke in our room but we didn't report it.  We should have.  We simply opened the window to cool the room down. The toliet paper was horrible but the body wash was nice.  The free water was also a plus.  There was a roof top bar and a Chinese restaurant located in the hotel.  We didn't eat at either but we did eat at Felice across the street and the food was delicious! The hotel is located in a very congested area in the financial district,  so be careful if you aren't familiar with the area,  you can get turned around easily.  The subway wasn't far at all and had access to every train we needed and we went all over lol.  Overall,  it was a pleasant stay but we have decided to stay uptown from now on.  ",6,robyn,2024-04-28

I was told I was sent an email about this but it was never received. Expedia weren’t aware either it was cancelled. If they had of contacted me I would have given them my new card details.

good option at downtown nyc,8,Nicolas,2024-04-12
"Great location for first time visitors to Munich -- easy walk to Marienplatz, Residenz, and train station.  Rooms were small but designed very well (like a ship's cabin) with plenty of storage and very clean.  Beds were comfortable, with firm mattresses.  We had a two-twin room and never felt cramped except when opening large suitcase at start and end of stay.

No elevator... husband carried 50lb suitcase up  4 flights of stairs -- whew!  And there is no climate control in the room.  I think there must be some airflow as we never got terribly warm or cool, regardless of outdoor temperature, but it seems to be centrally controlled by hotel for all rooms.

We did not eat the $15 per person breakfast (as budget travelers, we tend to grab a banana or cereal bar and go), but it looked and smelled delicious.  Definitely recommend Hotel Eder for budget travelers who don't want to hostel and want to walk to major attractions.  We would absolutely stay again.",8,Verified traveler,2024-04-12

Do not stay here if you are a light sleeper. They are doing construction like 100ft away and the noise is insane. They start at 7am. One night they started at 1am! The front desk said it has been going on for over two years. I asked for ear plugs and they said “that’s a good idea!” No kidding. I did not get any rest and my wife was so upset. I wish the hotel description had mentioned the construction noise. But we were never made aware of it. ,2,rafael,2024-04-09

"Llegamos al hotel en la tarde y fuimos recibidos con que nuestra reserva había sido cancelada porque no pudieron verificar la tarjeta de crédito y no contestamos el correo electrónico a tiempo (porque estábamos en un vuelo dirigidos a Nueva York sin acceso a internet, vale aclarar). Se nos dijo que nuestra habitación ya no estaba disponible (aunque habían pasado solo 20 minutos) y, en lugar de solucionar el problema en 5 minutos cómo haría cualquier hotel en serio, se nos ofreció una cama King y un colchón para que duerman 4 personas (siempre cobrandonos) u hospedarnos en otro hotel en Brooklyn, a 20 minutos de la reserva original. Luego de 2 horas de discusión, logramos acordar un precio más acorde para lo que nos ofrecía el hotel, que en ningún momento se hizo cargo del inconveniente o el tiempo perdido. Cuando creíamos que no podía ser peor, bajamos a la mañana a desayunar y fuimos recibidos por un hombre que no nos quería atender porque la cocina cerraba en 30 minutos, que apagó las luces a las 10 cuando todavía había gente comiendo y que nos mandó callar",2,Cecilia Ines,2024-04-08

This level of service is exemplary and definitely exceeded my expectations at every level and this also includes their housekeeping department!  

And,  I will never forget the  (The Golden WUISH DUCKHOUSE) where I had the best Peking Duck Ever.! 

I would absolutely recommend Sheraton Four Points to my friends and family members!

"Hotel está localizado em uma área com muitos moradores de rua e muito lixo, uma área que está passando por reforma ( muitas áreas de NYC estão). O percurso do hotel até o metrô está cheio de moradores de rua e muitas pessoas fazendo uso de entorpecentes, qualquer hora do dia. Era frustrante estar em NYC e no final do dia ter que encarar a realidade do caminho de volta pro hotel. 

O conforto do quarto; cama, toalhas e banho é bom Tem uma cafeteira no quarto com embalagens de café de cortesia e nos dias que acordamos bem cedo, tinha o mesmo café no hall do hotel disponível. A cortesia do café foi uma iniciativa excelente, mas a qualidade do café não era boa. 

O hotel tem um bar no roof top e os elevadores eram compartilhados com os hóspedes, por vezes faziam filas enormes e um elevador ainda ficou fora de serviço. 

Quando precisamos de estacionamento foi cobrado a pernoite.  ",6,Kelma Cristina,2024-03-24

"A 15-minute wait for an elevator.  Service staff used the elevator instead of a service elevator, so often was filled, and no one could get on. AC did not work for about 8 hours. The road was blocked off by construction across the street, so could not get to the entrance to unload passengers and luggage. The hall light did not work. The bathroom sink was clogged and was slow to drain. The staff did not seem to care about frustrations.  There is a sign in the elevator asking for a ""10"" review score.  They would not have to ask if the service and amenities were better.  Only one ice machine and microwave on the  2nd floor for a 29-floor hotel is ridiculous.  They need mini-fridges and microwaves in the rooms. Maybe get some security on the premises to curtail the weed smoking in rooms because the smell came over into our room and stunk it up.  WILL NOT STAY HERE AGAIN. ",4,Ivan,2024-03-18

Transport was easy and very close, and we were walking distance from Brooklyn Bridge, Battery Park, the Staten Island Ferry, Wall Street, and the World Trade Centre. Plenty of affordable places to eat also within walking distance. Great beds and a peaceful area too.",10,Anna,2024-03-17
"This was a convenient hotel with good service. The hotel was near a host of train lines which is convenient getting all over the city. Additionally, I appreciated having maid service daily which is unfortunately rare these days. The hotel also had a 24 hour gym and was close to the river for runs. The only two negatives were no mini fridge in room, and one of the elevators broke on my last day there. Other than that, would highly recommend this hotel.",10,Randi,2024-03-17

We picked this location for an overnight stay in NYC because it advertised having parking. No problem getting to the garage just down the street, leaving or retrieving the vehicle.

We visited the oculus mall and World Trade Center which was about 15 mins walking. Easy to access public transportation. Staff cleaned and replenished us daily. No complaints. They have a restaurant on the top floor and one downstairs. We did not do breakfast here. There is construction going on but it didn’t bother us at all throughout the night.

Er staan 2 bedden en een prima badkamer. Meer heb je niet nodig in NY. Wij vonden de locatie heel fijn. Wat rustiger dan in het drukke Manhattan. Met metro ben je er zo en we hebben veel gelopen. In de buurt zit het Memorial, Westfield stopping center en nog veel meer. Restaurant Stout zit er ook. Supermarkt in de omgeving en genoeg andere eet en drink gelegenheden. Je bent maar weinig in het hotel dus prima zo. Je hebt niets meer nodig. Aardige mensen. Met taxi goed bereikbaar vanaf JFK. Ongeveer uur reistijd. Wij hadden geen ontbijt. In de lift in het weekend vooral wat mensen die naar de rooftop gaan. Prima. Geen last van als je naar je kamer gaat. 3 liften. Je moet soms even wachten maar op zich prima allemaal.

Did a late check-in and Front desk person was very nice.The room was little smaller than other rooms I've stayed in.(Had a corner room) In a way that's what made it fun. The shower was amazing hot water was no problem. Working the tv took a minute to figure channels out but got it. I do wish there was a refrigerator in the room.

"Centrally situated between Wall Street and Chinatown, the Century Hotel offers a convenient location for exploring the heart of New York City. The hotel's rooms, while comfortable, reflect the standard accommodations you'd expect from a typical New York City hotel.

One minor issue I encountered during my stay was the clunky television in the room. Navigating through channels proved to be less than straightforward, which was a bit frustrating at times. However, it's important to note that this was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise pleasant stay.

The Century Hotel's prime location allowed me to easily explore the vibrant neighborhoods of Wall Street and Chinatown, both of which are rich in culture and dining options. The hotel staff were courteous and accommodating, contributing to an overall positive experience.

While there's room for improvement in terms of the in-room amenities, the Century Hotel remains a decent choice for travelers seeking a well-located base to explore New York City's downtown attractions.",8,Michael,2023-09-09

"The air conditioning in room 1404 was out. Temperature was 82 degrees in the room when we checked in. We checked to see if the air was in the on position in the room and went to eat to give the room time to cool down. We returned and it was still 82 in the room. Called front desk and they sent up someone about 9pm. The air worked for about 5 min and shut off. We waited to give the unit time to restart and it never did. Called back to the front desk at 945pm and advised them the air isn't working and told them our room number 3 times. 1005pm called the front desk again and I advised them my mother was on oxygen, it was too hot in the room, and requested to be moved to another room. I was advised the hotel was overbooked and there were no other rooms available. I asked to be moved to another hotel and was told the supervisor would have to be consulted and that maintenance said they fixed our air. We had to open the windows and crack the room door in order to get some air into the room. We barricaded the door in order to allow air to move through the room and when security came through at 1230 am he asked why was our door open. At that time a manager named Brenda came up and claimed the computer system showed we were moved to another room earlier in the night which was not accurate, and we never heard anything back from anyone after the last call at 1005pm. 1245 am, we had to move to another room that was miraculously empty but the hotel was overbooked.

"Great location and service.  Had no issues with the hotel, just had a few minor defects that should’ve been addressed such as the tissue box in bathroom being empty, the sprinkler in bathroom ceiling had no finishing ring around it so looked almost like a hole with pipe sticking down, and the wallpaper was peeling from the seams.  But overall the experience was good with friendly service.  Would stay again.  ",8,Daniel,2023-08-23
,10,ALAN,2023-08-22
"The wallpaper was peeling, light fixtures were loose, and the bathroom under sink cabinet had cracked and peeling laminate that should have been replaced years ago. The door was only there to block light, sound came right through. Multiple times I heard knocking on a nearby door that I thought was for us. The water temp for both shower & sink went from ""warm"" to ""scalding"", so I only had to turn the shower on a few angles. Even 1/8th turn and it was too hot. The water pressure was also inconsistent, going in and out several times. And I could feel the outline of where walls used to be in the concrete under the carpet. Also, a single drawer and small closet is not enough when there isn't a place to keep luggage open too. This room is setup for one person, but has a king bed for two. I expected better of a >$200 room, even in Manhattan. I've slept in $50 rooms that were nicer. 
The housekeeping & front desk staff were wonderful. The room needs itself, and probably the entire floor, needs to be gutted and remodeled. I won't be recommending this to anyone.",4,David,2023-08-22

"THE BUILDING / ROOM:  The building was nice, and in good condition.   In our experience, city view rooms are not worth the upgrade.  Bathroom was clean and adequate.

Sheraton offers an e-key on their Bonvoy app, but it doesn’t do you any good at this property because it doesn’t work in the elevator — you have to tap your room key card to select your floor in the elevator, but the app doesn’t work for that.  

No mini-fridge / Housekeeping came each day and did a great job.

RECEPTION / CHARGES:  Checking in was quick and easy.  The receptionists were friendly and efficient, and there were no surprises on our final bill.  

NOISE:  The room itself was very quiet.  We couldn’t hear other guests or noise from the outside (Platt Street is not a not a main thoroughfare and is relatively quiet).  


SUMMARY:  We would stay here again, but just not pay for the city view upgrade.  ",8,Frederick,2023-08-15

Directed to a good sized room, with 2 double beds, on the 8 floor. Clean and functional, with good aircon - albeit slightly noisy at times - a pleasant bathroom and comfortable beds. Good storage, with helpful provisions in the room, such as a safe and iron. 

Good location in FiDi - close to multiple subway stations and eateries. Lobby and exterior area could be tidied up a little, and be prepared to wait for lifts at busy times. Water pressure in the shower was slightly low, and the WiFi dropped a few times. Rooftop bar meant many people in and out, but not too much of a hindrance.

Las muchachas de la recepción muy atentad y llegamos alrededor de la 1:00 y como la habitación estaba lista pudimos entrar antes sin cargo extra, también te cuidan las maletas después de la salida lo único malo es la construcción cerca que provoca que las mesas de frente al hotel siempre estén llenas de trabajadores y en ocasiones personas fumando pero en cuanto entras al hotel todo es muy agradable y aceptable para el precio.

Muy limpio todo y todos los días asearon la habitación y baño, hicieron las camas y repusieron agua y sobres de café y te.

"Helt ok hotell med bra läge nära finansdistrikten och One World. Bra utgångspunkt för resor med tunnelbanan. Vi hade lite bekymmer med säkerhetsskåpet på rummet och det var uppenbart att det var själva luckan/dörren det var fel på. Den gick inte att stänga, varför det inte heller gick att låsa skåpet. Vi påtalade detta från dag 1 och flera tekniker var upp på rummet. Först på tredje dagen fick vi ett nytt skåp. Några ur personalen var väldigt hjälpsamma och trevliga kring detta problem medan andra borde jobba mer på sitt bemötande av gästerna vid problem. Städningen var ok men någon dag fick vi bara en uppsättning handdukar och andra dagar fylldes varken tvål eller toapapper på vid den dagliga städningen.

The hotel room is very tiny, and the queen beds are narrower than the queen beds at other hotels. 1 adult and 1 kid will sleep okay in that bed, but even as a slim couple we didn’t sleep comfortably in one of the queen beds. The water pressure and the warm water was perfect. The tub was small. They have a bar on their rooftop, so some days and times there are people going up and down.  There are 2 renovations across the street, so there are some noises morning through afternoon. ",6,Olga Amalia,2023-04-20
"Die Lage des Hotels ist gut, die Umgebung schmutzig und leider sehr laut (die Großbaustelle nebenan hat nicht einmal am Karfreitag und Ostermontag den täglichen Baulärm ab 05.30h morgens unterbrochen). Die Zimmermädchen verstehen nicht einmal die einfachsten englischen Begriffe; oft waren die Zimmer bis 16.00h nicht fertig.

"The upsides were that there were no mice, roaches, bed bugs, or mold and the room did not smell bad. The beds were reasonably comfortable and the room was not too small. The water got warm quickly but the water pressure was not great. The shower curtain was too short and the drain did not drain well. It was actually pulled out when we got into the room and we found out that for a good reason-there was slow drainage when it was in. The room was not cleaned just shuffled around. We asked for another comforter the one we had was clumped and basically a sheet. We showed a picture to the front desk and were told it would be changed but it was not. The area is generally loud and but the hotel is conveniently located and a good value for the price. The next-door restaurant the hotel uses advertised breakfast on a banner till 11 but it was actually until 10:00. There are a few great places for breakfast in the area so it did not bother us and turned out a better option. The staff was super nice, helpful, and friendly.",6,Katarzyna,2023-03-23

Very walkable area, felt safe even late at night. Cleaning staff do a nice job and are very friendly. Small gym, open 24h.

Less good: Noisy—poor sound dampening from hallway and nearby rooms, small rooms (expected),  not dark, service other than cleaning is lacking (Eg asked for blanket that didn’t arrive), though staff are cordial.

Concierge was polite and informative during checkin and the phone app made checkout a breeze. 

The bedding was old, the comforter I had between my sheets was pilling and slightly off-white from the sheets that were surronding it. The A/C units were loud and disruptive. One elevator was out of service when I got there, and another broke down during my stay. 

There was also construction during my stay but that was noted during my booking and I actually did not hear much of it.

"Well I'm very familiar with the neighborhood since I attended Pace University around the corner, however, it is amazing how many hotels are now available in Tribeca compared to the welcome package  from the university when there was only three in 1993.",8,Aaron,2023-03-05

"I was surprised to learn when I arrived that there were no stairs other than emergency stairs. I tried to use them anyway, but I kept having to skirt bags of trash.

You should make it clear that your facility requires guests to use the elevator. I'm not sure I would book here again",6,Jennifer,2023-02-27

1st time in NYC. Had no issues with my room at all. Room service came to change our sheets and towels. Short walk to subway. Short walk to WYC and Staten Island ferry. FIDI was more quiet at nights then other districts. Will stay there again when I go back,10,Michael,2023-02-23

The room was the smallest room i have ever stayed in at a hotel. We had to remake the bed as the sheets were too small. They did not tuck in at bottom or top. They had a king size mattress cover on a queen bed and all it did was bunch up.,4,Bernard,2023-02-20

The property looks ok. The lounge on the 29th floor looked questionable and very loud.  We had hoped to eat up there with my teenage grandchildren but definitely not appropriate for teens.  We had hoped to have refrigerator but it did not have one.  Extremely small room also.  If we stay again we will be more aware we need to request specifics.Overall the staff was nice.,8,Cindy,2023-02-13

O quarto era extremamente confortável, limpeza realizada diariamente, sendo também repostas duas garrafas de água por dia (gratuitamente). Havia cafeteira no quarto com opções de café e chá, secador de cabelos potente no banheiro, que possuía também shampoo, condicionar e sabonete líquido de boa qualidade. Hotel localizado há poucos minutos da estação de metrô que, por sua vez, dá acesso fácil à toda cidade. Adoramos tudo!",10,Evelin,2023-02-09
"Great downtown location on a historic street, plenty of food options within an easy walk. Several subway lines are also an easy walk, as is Battery Park, the Native American Museum, and South St Seaport. Biggest problem with this hotel is the elevator. 3 elevators for 40  floors does not seem to be sufficient. ",8,Erica,2023-02-08

"The check in was difficult the room was very small no closet room most definitely did not look like the pictures the ac would not turn off and the window kept opening in the middle of the night the water would cut off if you changed it from hot to cold , the room door would not stay closed when we left out we had to make sure it was closed , the elevator smells like cigarettes and they most definitely need some work the sounds while going from floor to floor is ridiculous, would not recommend!! Do not stay here ",4,Shontinique,2023-02-04
The hotel is in need of an upgrade. Some of the elevators were out of order. The room was clean but needed an upgrade as well. Not what I expected for NYC. ,8,Valerie,2023-02-03
"Receptionists were very nice, and location was very convenient. Our only disappointment was heat in the room. Our room #809 had no heat. Called three times. A technician came and replaced thermostat, but the thermostat was not adjustable. So the heat was constantly on and the room became very hot. I went downstairs and asked for changing room. Receptionist gave me #1202. This time I went there and checked the thermostat before moving. I saw the same issue - furnace didn’t respond to temperature setting. So I requested for another change. This time I was given a room in 27th floor. Checked thermostat. It worked. So we moved in. Sometime in midnight, the heat stopped. We were frustrated but too tired to request for another change. Next morning receptionist gave us two breakfast vouchers. I believe that my experience was not unique. Other guests might reported the same issue but the hotel never fixed it. So my impression was that the hotel had management issue. Not recommended.",4,Wei,2023-02-02

"If you need a good night's sleep and in-and-out convenience, look elsewhere. Noisy electronic beeping from building equipment all night. Tall thin building requires elevators to move about, but one elevator out of service during entire visit, the other two elevators overworked and slow. Friendly staff, but understaffed, so too busy to address any issues. Be aware that the rooftop bar draws a party crowd on weekends, many of whom are so high it's surprising they need an elevator to get up there. Very limited dining options nearby.  Avoid Henry's Italian unless you're looking for the blandest Italian food ever made.  ",4,David,2023-01-30
