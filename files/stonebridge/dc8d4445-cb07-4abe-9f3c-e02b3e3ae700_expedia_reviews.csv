"The staff was above and beyond professional and friendly. 
The restaurant was exceptional. I enjoyed a wonderful meal at the bar. 
I thought I lost a ring and they responded immediately to look for it and called me back even when they did not find it. Instead of saying we will call you if we find it. I later found it in my suitcase. ",10,Julie,2025-08-25

We were scrambling for a place to stay after our original place canceled on us. Got here and the staff was amazingly sweet the did everything they could to help us.,10,Ashley,2025-07-25
I had to wait 30 minutes for check in because I had booked using Expedia and I guess it hadn’t went through yet.. when I entered the room I saw there was trash left in the garbage bin. When i was checking the sheets with a flashlight as I held them up I saw stains on it.,8,Jesus,2025-07-24

"We had a wonderful stay! Our room with two queens was so nice, and the bathroom was huge with a terrific glassed-in shower that felt like something at a spa. There was a nice sitting area with chairs and a loveseat. We were able to log into our own Amazon Prime account for movie viewing on the television, which was very convenient. We had a very nice view on the 12th floor. The beds/linens/towels/pillows/comforters were so nice. We enjoyed eating at Saranello's downstairs, just a short walk from our room. We'll be back!",10,Rae Anne,2025-07-20

"I stayed here a few years ago and it was great. This most recent time though was disappointing. The staff seemed off. Not welcoming and when my acquaintance asked if there was a sauna or steam room, the woman that evening answered him walking away. The rooms are dated and need to be refreshed. The drain in the shower broke so the water didn’t drain. They also removed the hot tub so that was very disappointing. Area around the hotel is nice. I wouldn’t stay here again. ",4,Kelvin,2024-09-29

The chair in our room was peeling really bad. My friend sat in it and when she got up there were black pieces all over her legs. The table top had spots on it.  The dress was broken and hard to move the drawers in and out. This room wasn’t cheap but the furniture in it was definitely old and needs to be replaced. Not worth the price I paid and I am highly disappointed because I’ve stayed here before and never dealt with this. ,4,Brittanie,2024-06-15

Nice hotel but parking is too far,6,Lisa,2023-10-22
On the day of checkout housekeeping walked into our room at 9 AM without knocking!!! We were awakened by someone literally walking into our room. They quickly left and I ran out after the person and asked why the heck they just walked in. She said she thought we had checked out! I said first of all it’s 9 am!! Checkout is noon! Second of all you knock first and identify yourself to me!!! And lastly she could have checked with the front desk to see if we checked out. I told all of this to the manager and all he did was give me $10 coupon to the hotel store for snacks!! I’m very very upset how this was handled. I thought the hotel was beautiful and clean and smelled good but this situation should have been handled much better. I would have been happy with a free night or two in the future for this huge inconvenience. It was terrifying having someone walk in your room while you are dead asleep!! None of this is okay! I would like to stay there again but not if the hotel isn’t willing to comp me for a future stay. We were awakened 3 hours before checkout. We were exhausted and had to travel home that day. My ratings will remain how they are unless they rectify this. ,2,Leah,2023-10-21
