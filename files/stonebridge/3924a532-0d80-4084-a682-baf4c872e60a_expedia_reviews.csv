Awesome stay!,10,Justin,2025-09-24
"We had a great experience here. We brought our toddler and found it very family friendly. The hotel was quiet and clean, staff were professional, and breakfast was great. Very close to the metro. It felt safe with plenty of law enforcement and National Guard in the neighborhood. 10/10.",10,Justin,2025-09-14

The floors were slick tile that made safe independent chair transfers impossible. I couldn’t even get from the main room to the bathroom alone because the threshold was so tall I couldn’t get over it alone.  And while there were grab bars for days and a moveable shower wand a lack of a shower seat made it impossible to shower for anyone who could not stand.,6,Verified traveler,2025-09-07

"Unfortunately, parking was not available as advertised. We ended up in what was described by hotel staff as ""the closest parking garage,"" which was 5 blocks away. In addition, the cable TV did not have a strong enough signal (bandwidth) to make it watchable. Considering these issues, along with a lousy breakfast, and we will NOT be going back!

"We stayed for 3 nights over 4th of July. Beds were comfy, room was clean, and decent breakfast was included. Other than that, there are no amenities. No pool, no coffee during the day, just one water jug that was usually empty.  It said room service was provided every other day, but our room was never serviced. I’m sure I could’ve asked, but we just requested more towels and toilet paper.  We were in town to visit the monuments in DC and to go to a Nationals game.  The location for that was super convenient, just a block away, with several restaurants around.  The metro was around the corner for quick trips anywhere we needed to go.  On the 4th, when we left our hotel around 7 to head to the National Mall, there were teenagers hanging around the entry to our hotel and a large police presence outside.  Once we walked through the group and headed toward the metro, some type of fireworks/bottle rockets started going off.  These kids were running around throwing them everywhere and the police were struggling to stop them.  We rushed to the metro, but when we returned around 10pm, it was worse.  At least at this point they had someone from the hotel staff keeping the kids out of the hotel entry, but it felt dangerous.  Our kids were scared and we had no choice but to rush from the Metro to the hotel with some other guests.  Thankfully we made it without incident, but other than a one-night stay for a game, I wouldn’t choose this location again.  Suburban didn’t fit in their garage",8,Nicole,2025-07-06

"While the hotel's proximity to the stadium was convenient, the overall experience was quite disappointing. Despite requesting room cleaning on three separate occasions, the service was not provided. Furthermore, the breakfast unfortunately led to food poisoning. Considering the nightly rate of approximately $900, the value was not commensurate with the quality of service received. To add to the issues, the in-room telephones were non-functional, and we discovered trash in the room. We will not be returning.",2,Arleth,2025-06-24

"This stay was perfect! I expected great things for the location, plus being in the D.C. area in general, and it did not disappoint. I was happy to have such a nice experience along with breakfast included in the stay. The receptionists at the front desk were friendly and accommodating. My room was clean, spacious and functioned exceptionally well. I typically prefer extra layers when I sleep, and there was no shortage of that; there were extra linens and a blanket provided in the coat closet. The thermostat also worked well, heating the room to my liking within ten minutes. There was a full-size kitchen, with refrigeration, a microwave, a stove and plenty cabinet space if you’re staying longer. The bathroom was exceptionally clean and comforting with two sources of great lighting, plenty of towels, storage and full stock of soaps.

The location is in an extremely walkable area, as most of D.C. is already. A one minute walk from the baseball stadium, five minutes from waterfront restaurants, and a short uber just about anywhere else. I would be happy and willing to stay here for all of my visits to the D.C. area. ",10,Maya,2025-02-12

"My dad and I enjoyed our stay in Residence Inn! It’s so close to the subway and it’s a safe place to stay. The free breakfast was great, the dining area is wonderful. We love that the room provides a kitchenette that has good quality kitchen appliances (all stainless steel which I love) and it’s such a plus so we can make dinner after a long day out and didn’t want to be out for dinner. (No oil provided but a mini bottle of salt and pepper). We had some problem with the kitchen sink and they sent maintenance guy to fix it, though problem came back again, they switched room for us, and we were totally fine with it because we did enjoy our stay and they solved the problem.

"this is the second time we have stayed in this hotel to visit DC. on January 31, while my son in law and husband with our dog, were in the non-check in ground floor waiting for our car to be parked by valet, a suspicious person tried to grab the shopping bags from them and assaulted my son in law as he prevented this suspicious person from stealing our stuff. my children and I were at the ""somewhere"" cafe, getting our drinks.
when we got up and told the front desk person about the incident, she was already in tears as apparently, the same person were also upstairs in the lobby check in floor and ransacked the mini mart, before said person got down to attack my family.
there is no security in that ground floor area. the valet person is almost always in a room behind that decorative
screen.
police is called and my son in law had to report to the cops, afterwards.
what a vacation.  this property needs better security for the customers and for their staff.",6,Maria,2025-01-07

Muy completa,  muy limpia, las camas comodas y almohadas  incluyendo el sofá cama.  Daban limpieza en la habitación y cambiaron las toallas. 
Baño amplio, cocina completa con todos sus implementos.
El hotel incluye desayuno , que aunque es casi lo mismo todos los días esta muy completo, fresco  y rico. 
El hotel esta muy bien ubicado, en un area con restaurantes y a una calle esta la estación del metro. 
Lo unico malo que puedo mencionar es  que durante nuestra estancia solo tuvimos un ascensor, ( el segundo estuvo dañado todos los días) y se hacian filas para bajar o subir.

"Hotel overall was great, breakfast was okay. Eggs at one point tasted weird. Valet Parking is a whole other story. Night shift attendant was never to be found and always had to contact front desk. Overall waiting for a valet attendant was annoying, would prefer to be able to park myself",6,Giovanni,2024-12-01
"Our suite with two queens and a kitchen area was very spacious and clean. The breakfast was very good and the room in which is was served was large and light-filled. The valet parking was $65.00 a night and there is a lot across the street for 40.00 and spot-hero garages nearby for 22.00. The lobby is one floor up from the entry so two elevators are required to get to the rooms. For that reason, we would probably not stay here again. Train is across the street. Ubers are plentiful but pricey.",8,Karen,2024-12-01
"This is our second time staying at this hotel over Thanksgiving. We come to visit family who lives in the area. But we love this hotel for a lot of reasons, the first is that it is a very clean hotel. It is very easy to find and it feels very clean there. The continental breakfast is also one of the best we’ve ever had. I also appreciate that the rooms don’t have carpet and they are fully accessible kitchens, which is not something you find in a city let alone a room that fits as many people as it did for us. I traveled with my husband and four kids, one of which includes a one-year-old who slept in a provided Rollaway crib.  

Parking is not the most ideal there just with valet being $65 a night, however, there is a lot adjacent to the hotel that is $40 a night which is so expensive but much better than the valet. The area seems very safe we walked at all times of the night and day with no issues. There is a little street parking so I feel like in a big city like that you’re gonna have snappy with parking and it was just as easy to save the $25 by parking across the street. The staff was also super friendly at check-in and bringing us the extra towels and crib that we needed.

Front desks is on the second floor.  When you walk in to the hotel there is no one there to greet you and guide you to the second floor.  Staff was not very friendly.  They are not rude but you definitely did not feel welcome.  ,10,Robert,2024-11-30

"I was out in DC for a vacation and definitely had a great time. I really enjoyed staying at the Residence Inn. It was very clean, lots of nice dining options, super close to the wharf and the Nationals stadium. It is in a very safe area. Many transportation options however we used Lyft to go sightseeing at the capital, national mall etc. The reason for my 4 star rating was I was charged for a third day of  parking even though the car was only there two nights and that’s an additional $65. Additionally, tv reception wasn’t that great…..and we were not there to watch tv so that didn’t bother me too much. 
Btw the breakfast was great and all the staff was super nice.",10,Judy,2024-11-01

"This hotel is in a good location- close to the green line Metro, close to restaurants and a Harris Teeter. Our studio room was clean, spacious, and accommodated four adults pleasantly. Breakfast held good options to start the day off well.
Valet parking is available, but a less expensive option is a block away. When we arrived, I left my party to handle checkin and to learn about parking options. Unfortunately, my party was rushed to evacuate to vehicle and put the car into valet. Many items were left behind that we retrieved the next day. The hotel needs to work on the initial contact and valet needs to not rush, push, the customer around.",10,Sommer,2024-10-17

We didn't realize how close we were to the ball park which was really nice, so we indulged and did a baseball game too since it was walking distanxe. The breakfast was really great. The only thing we could think to improve would be a slightly more reasonable valet fee (65/day, we opted for metro to avoid), and the beds were a little firm but honestly we would stay here again in a heartbeat ",10,Shakia,2024-09-02

" easily walkable, staff were friendly and attentive. A bit pricey, hot water in the room wasn’t very hot by my standard but otherwise a nice room. They do charge tax on top of the valet parking fee expect another 10 dollars on top of the 65 if you choose to valet there but even that was probably worth it as you don’t have to find a spot and parking in the city is expensive but they really are responsive.",10,Daniel,2024-04-29

"Stayed here for a full week. Staff friendly.location ideal. They did keep running out of food and coffee at breakfast, but seemed very busy and staff were constantly refilling things at breakfast. Food was excellent! Coffee excellent! View from lounge/eating area overlooked grassy area, was very picturesque. Lots of comfortable seating. We saw an amazing fireworks display from our room, set off by Nationals ballpark. The only disappointment was lack of in room housekeeping. We specifically chose the hotel over Air bnb for daily housekeeping. We only got service 2x in 7 days. One of those days we were told we’d get cleaning, they never showed at all. When we alerted the housekeeping staff, in the afternoon, they agreed to come, but never did, another call to front desk resulted in cleaning next day and apology from manager by call, hand written note and a complimentary packaged snack.",10,Melissa,2024-04-20

"Pros: Nice area, lots of food options (loved Circa restaurant), very close to metro station, clean, lovely and updated hotel and room, no carpet so floor was clean, breakfast was great (6:30-9am) with lots of seating. Cons: the shampoo, conditioner and body wash provided in the dispensers were junk. Shampoo didn’t lather, conditioner didn’t condition anything and the body wash smelled like public restroom hand soap. I even smelled it on my husband from a foot away after he showered. Also, our room was cleaned to only minimum standards before we arrived (example: popcorn and crumbs in pull out sofa bed), but it was still doable. They never cleaned our room during our 5 night stay, so that was disappointing, although we were jet lagged and left between 10am-12 noon for 3 of the days. Other hotels would have knocked anyway or called that evening to check if we needed anything after 2 days. The AC was loud and only seemed to blow very cold air, so it would constantly kick on and be freezing, then go off and we’d get warm. We had it set between 68 to 70, so that was tricky during April with weather in the 50s. Overall, liked our stay OK, but it was not great for longer than 2 nights, especially being late starters.",8,Samantha,2024-04-05

"I felt safe in this hotel, which was of higher importance for us considering we are used to small town life.  The hotel has a walk in/valet entry, but then you have to take an elevator to get to the hotel lobby.  Then there is another set of elevators that only go up with your hotel key card. The continental breakfast was above average, though one morning they shut down early bc it was so busy with a school trip. Room was quiet and clean.

"Well let me just say this was a complete great experience except for one thing… the valet drivers left my windows down overnight. Obviously bugs got in my car.. including spiders and German roaches. After I noticed after getting my car from valet I immediately called the hotel. I was told that there was nothing they would do about it even though I had an 8 hour ride the next day and didn’t want to ride with bugs. So for the last night of my stay I took my car up the street and parked it for less money, lol! All I’m saying is the place is fine. Didn’t feel like I was respected by the one man I spoke to on the phone though and also would not recommend the valet ",2,Peyton,2024-03-17

I gave the lowest level of stars because my husband and I got sick before our trip one with COVID and the other with RSV and they would not cancel my reservation without charging me for the stay which is totally outrageous being the reason was we were sick. It's obvious that the company doesn't care about it's guest. I told them since I was being charged anyways that I was going to just take the trip from Philadelphia to Washington D.C with two viruses possibly contaminating the hotel. They did not even care they want the money regardless of any health hazards which is pretty sickening and unprofessional. ,2,Angela,2024-02-25

"My experience at this hotel was good overall. The front desk staff, upon my arrival, was friendly and very helpful. The room was fairly comfortable and the lack of outside noise from the hallway and other guest rooms was superb. The breakfast was also tasty.  The location is also close to many restaurants and bars, a plus for those without transportation.

While there are many positive aspects of this establishment, there are some negative ones.  The bed was quite firm and the pillows flat.  The refrigerator was pretty nosy and despite there being an ice maker in the refrigerator, it took over 24 hours to make enough ice suitable for our beverages. On the second night, I used the spare blanket, which was not replaced despite my calling the front desk and asking for another one.

"It’s in a great location, just need better parking, better breakfast options, and I’ve never been to a hotel with no pool lol. But overall great hotel definitely would book again.",8,Zachary,2023-07-10
"Property is great location for public transportation, entertainment and walking distance to attractions. Breakfast was very delicious, warm with great variety. Parking is a bit of a beast. Parking garages close at night and valet is pretty expensive.

All in all solid I would stay again and AND bring my family. ",10,Briana,2023-07-08

"I am kind of a hotel snob. This property was GREAT! It was incredibly clean. The breakfast (which I would normally not eat in any hotel) was REALLY GOOD and really clean!! Cage free eggs, egg white frittatas, turkey sausage, oats, all sorts of bagels and toast etc and much more. I was very impressed! The staff was incredibly friendly and the neighborhood is nice. This hotel is a stones through from the Nat's Stadium. The room was large and had a kitchen dinette in it which was a nice surprise. Great value for the money!",10,TRISH,2023-02-22
