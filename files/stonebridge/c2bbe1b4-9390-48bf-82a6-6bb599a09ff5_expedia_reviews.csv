"My overall stay at this hotel was unsatisfactory. The sheets were dirty with
hair on them, which was unacceptable. Additionally, front desk staff members were extremely rude and lacked clear communication. The only positive experience I had was with the gentleman who greeted me and assisted with my bags  he was kind and professional. Unfortunately, this was my first and last stay here.",4,Shawntel,2025-10-04

"This was our second time staying at this property and it is important to know that the staff is the best. They are accommodating and go above and beyond. When we checked in, I asked if room 1901 was available, as this was the room we stayed in previously and we loved it. It was quiet and had a beautiful view. Since that room was not available, we were given room 401. Unfortunately, that turned out to be a terrible room because the building's multiple fans were right outside our room causing loud noises all night. Second, there was a loud repeated humming noise coming from a ceiling light fixture. With all this loud noise, we could not sleep. The next day I went to the front desk and explained our situation and asked to be moved. Lucky for us, room 1901 was now available. The staff went above and beyond making sure we were comfortable and made sure to transfer our luggage to the new room. I will always consider this hotel on our next trip. I will always recommend this hotel to friends and family. I am grateful for the staff at this hotel. They are the best.",10,Ibtisam,2025-10-02

"I just want to say this wasn’t my best Sheraton experience!! I went for my bday and ON my actual bday my bathroom ceiling started leaking and then I had to leave my room early, the hotel gave me no type of compensation for the inconvenience! The manager was very standoffish and rude whenever I had a complaint! Staff member Alize (spelling) was great but everyone else were not very friendly! I honestly would’ve liked a discount or a night back!! The area surrounding the hotel was not great! I will not be staying there again!!",6,Chimebere,2025-09-16

"I had the absolute BEST stay at this hotel, as often as I frequent NYC I decided to give a new hotel a shot & I am sure happy I did. Every bit of the hotel staff was amazing which is the main thing I look for as a female solo traveler.  ESPECIALLY the lovely Laylah who is at the front desk. I will definitely be back. so excited to stay here again! xx",10,Amialia,2025-09-14

"Had to change rooms twice. First room because the mattress sunk down entirely when I sat down on it. (Like, butt down to the box spring, feet in the air. Another guest I spoke to said this happened in the rooms of a couple people he was traveling with, too.) Second room because it reeked of cigarette smoke. Third room was fine. Nothing fancy. If I'd gotten that room first I would've thought it was an okay/passable hotel. ",4,Lia,2025-08-17

the property was nice and the room was decent but there were undiscussed and unapproved charges made to a card that they were not authorized to charge anything to that were done AFTER i had already checked out and left the state. i even tried calling multiple times using the number on the actual hotel website only to never have anyone pick up the phone so be wary of trying to call to discuss anything before or after your stay. ,6,Alicia,2025-08-06

"When we checked into the hotel at 1:30am, our AC was not working. In the middle of a heat wave, this is obviously unacceptable. I went down to inform the front desk who then noted that they would send a fan up to the room and inform engineering (it was 1:30am, so I understand someone may not be onsite). No one gave us an update the next day in any capacity as to whether or not engineering would come. After having a day in the city, we came back and let front desk know that our AC was still broken. They sent a tech up immediately who fiddled around with the thermostat, replaced a filter, and came back 3 minutes later with another fan. Both nights the room ranged in the 80-83 degree range which is obviously very uncomfortable. 

Oh, and the room didn’t have access to Wi-Fi for the first night. 

It’s a shame as check in was smooth, the hotel isn’t bad aesthetically, and it’s located in a good area. This AC thing really bothered me and made me uncomfortable for two straight nights - not something you want for your guests. ",4,Jeremy,2025-07-31

"Dårlig oplevelse med dårlig eksekvering.
Personalet var egentlig meget flinke, men de kunne ikke hjælpe os med noget medmindre vi selv kom med en løsning.

Vi boede 9 nætter på Sheraton Brooklyn, hvor de første 2 nætter var uacceptable. Airconditionen virkede ikke, temperaturen i værelset var som at være i en tropisk jungle,  vi fik næsten ingen søvn. 

Det værste var dog personalets håndtering: Jeg talte med flere end fem medarbejdere, og fik modsatrettede svar og ingen reel hjælp. Jeg måtte selv følge op dag og nat og finde løsninger – det burde ikke være gæstens ansvar på et firestjernet hotel.

De sidste 7 nætter var fine, da vi endelig fik et nyt velfungerende værelse, men de første 2 trak hele oplevelsen ned. Afventer kompensation for de 2 nætter. ",4,Peter,2025-07-25

"The hotel is conveniently located right across from DeKalb Market and food hall, so great for shopping (Primark, Target, Sephora and others right across the street) plus lots of great restaurants, including Katz Deli. But the hotel is old and has not been maintained well. In our bathroom there was a support bar in the shower that had rusted through and came right out of the wall. An elderly or infirm person, or even a child, could easily have been injured while using it. Don’t rely on the car service they push for rides to the airport. The driver didn’t show up for our early morning ride to JFK. Happily there was an Uber nearby.",4,DAVID,2025-07-24

"Absolutely unacceptable experience. I was charged an extra $90 with no prior notice, even though my entire stay, including all fees, taxes, and the security deposit, had already been paid in full. I reached out multiple times and never received a refund or even a response. This is completely unprofessional and shows a lack of respect for guests. I do not recommend this place to anyone.",2,Marcio,2025-07-19
"Check-in was fine, got in early. Caught a Liberty game and when we got back hopped in elevator and got stuck for 15min going up and down and door would not open. I had to pry it open at the staff basement level to get us and father and daughter out. Staff didn’t help, buttons for emergency didn’t work, a guest called 9/11 for us. We didn’t stay and all they gave was a 50% refund. Lady who called 9/11 said she is on her 3rd room, first smelled like urine and second someone was already in. ",2,Edward,2025-07-17

"First there was no pool, as shown on Expedia. Then we get there, the pool is open to a swim school, not guest. The lobby smells like a chlorine pool, but you can't use it. 
   We get in the room and the bathroom shower was disgusting. The tile was cracked and filled with scum. There was a dead bug in the shower. We had to go buy shower shoes. The exhaust fan did not function. The toilet flushed it's self every 30 minutes. 
  The thermostat was hanging loose on the wall. 
    The lock to the balcony was broken. The lock to the adjoining room was broken. Did not feel safe. The wall outlet was sunken into a wall and looked like a fire hazard.  
  We were on the 9th floor and the ice machine was broken. We were directed to the 2nd floor. 
   The balcony itself had patio furniture with rips in it. There were cigarettes buds in the tile of the balcony, and garbages stuffed around the edges. ",2,Katelyn,2025-07-14
"My biggest issue with the hotel is that we were traveling with 2 young kids (under 3), I booked a suite at the hotel, but the room was not available for our check in. Very frustrating given that I searched the internet for hours looking for a room that would work well for our family. There was also a club or bar that had loud music blasting until 3am. Made the night less than desirable. Hotel is very busy so staff gave the vibe they are “over it” and I don’t really blame them. ",8,Kasey,2025-07-13

Sheraton is a respected company worldwide but managed so poorly.  This property has no parking and no restaurant only a small snack/coffee shop that’s not even good.  Phones don’t work and broken elevators.  Lucky booked only for one nigh.  ,6,Fazle,2025-07-08
"Room shabby Bathroom railing fell off the wall. No chair with sides for my husband as he needs chair to be able to push himself up and refusal was given as they did not have a chair. The business chair cover was peeling floor appeared not to have vacuumed When I booked I booked on the understanding that it had a restaurant as my husband is in a w’chair. Told not my problem no longer restaurant and deli down the road or across the park I am unable to push my husband so I felt we had no choice but to find alternate accomadation and we left. Also I feel the site was misrepresented and purely trading on the name of the Sheraton group. I am going to ask for our money back as there is no way any immobile person can eat.

Returned from a long day of meetings to find they had not even followed up on the issue. Second night with no AC and a cheap fan during a heatwave. 

Sheraton still has not reached out about compensating for the issue. 

Expedia refused to assist with relocation to a different hotel since it was not a valid reason to change the reservation per their customer service. 

Worst travel experience I have had across 4 continents. 

I will never use Expedia again, their support and service are worthless. ",2,Robert,2025-06-30

"This property is the worst property to carry marriot upon arriving i noticed 3 employees at one side of the desk. Manager i assume , concierge guy and another employee  they never help ask if i needed assistance and or greeted me when i arrived with 5 bags.  10 days stay was the worst stay. Would go up to desk ask for a plastic spoon evelyn was so lazy to get up she tells me she could have it sent up well as you know it never arrived. No business centern.The best employees at this facility were the custodian staff who clean the room.  They were very polite. Welcoming every morning and eager to do they job.. somewhere the front desk staff needs to take lessons . There was one African american lady i didnt get the names who had to always and i mean always wait on evwryone. No matter who else was working with her. They routed mainly all guest to her unless they felt it was somone they need to serviced... Elevator gets stuck while im trying to come down from 12th floor and  no one knows anything when you call front  desk then when i hung up on her. She turned key card off so i couldnt back in room so now we just standing in hallway.  Another nice guy staying there call from his cell to say we are stuck and she told him he would have to walk down. 12 floors now  He told her that i had lots of bags and they needed to send help. A guy came up look at my cart and said no turned around n went back down. Now mind you i have a flight to catch abd one again noone coukd explain.NEVER again",4,Felicia,2025-04-04
"It was 75 degrees in NY and there was no AC bc the building is old and they have central HVAC. Receptionist desk was too tall so I was talking to the back of a computer monitor upon my arrival. We had to go to the side to see their face. Room vinyl floor plank had a gap, the wardrobe drawer would not close properly and kept coming out and I can imagine me tripping over and falling at night.

"it was often difficult to get our room serviced during our stay, but it is understandable, as we spent a decent amount of time in it. The reason for four stars instead of five on staff and service is that the housekeeping staff seem very overworked. They often forgot things, like if I asked for extra Q-tips or more sugar and creamer for the room. Once they left a trash bag inside the room, they did not come and clean the room the next day. Overall the stay was great, and everyone was polite and very friendly. I think they could fix these minor setbacks by simply keeping a written list of rooms that need to be serviced that day and special requests. Then just check them off as they are done.",8,Jason,2025-01-13

"This was the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at. 
When I arrived, the front desk staff member charged me a lot more than she was supposed to. She did a double transaction for 9 nights which is a lot of money. A few days later, I noticed that two transactions were done and therefore leaving me with no money on my debit card. The manager was not helpful and blamed my bank instead of taking responsibility. He was very argumentative instead of helping to try and resolve the issue cooperatively. 

 After a few days of chasing various staff members to have it sorted it was finally resolved. Not a fun experience when you are trying to enjoy a holiday! Luckily I had cash with me.l but couldn’t use my card the whole time I was in NY.  

Aside from that, my room didn’t have conditioner in it when first arriving there. I also had to ask every day for toothpaste. The room temperature was always different and could not be reset. One night I was sweating and all they could do was bring me a fan. There was no drawers in the wardrobe but the rest of the room was nice and comfortable. 

The phone rarely rang through. When I did get through to ask a staff member for a hairdryer she said she had something else to do and would be 10 mins. She never showed so I had to go to bed with wet hair. Another time I asked for directions and the staff member sighed like he didn’t want to help. 
Elevators took a long time to get down, despite having four, only one or two would be working at a time.

This hotel is a safety hazard. The elevators shut off a 4:00am so you aren’t able to use it. The front desk doesn’t answer the phone if you need something. There is something off about the hotel entirely. Housekeeping did not speak English and came into my room ( I let her in because I needed fresh towels). She cleaned the bathroom while I was undressed. I couldn’t believe it was a Marriott Bonvoy hotel.,6,Amanda,2024-12-25

Our room was comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  The location is great for any access to subway transportation.  It is somewhat convenient for restaurants and other venues -- especially the Brooklyn Academy of Music.  Layout is a little strange - but it worked.  Note if you are parking a car that the hotel does not have it's own garage - you'll need to drop off any luggage - check in and then drive to park your car a few blocks away.,8,Susan,2024-12-19

"The hotel is located in a super practical area, a few blocks from the Brooklyn bridge and Fulton street. This is a very lively area which breathes with real new-Yorkers and a lot less tourists than Manhattan.

The hotel is correct at best, the beds are old, it's difficult to manage the AC which blasts Siberia cold air, and the view is a back Alley over thermoconvectors.

This being said, it's a very decent stopover on your way back to the airport to experience a super authentic experience. ",6,Nicolas,2024-08-29

"Everything was really good. The hotel staff was nice and helpful. I think my only “complaint” is that visually the room was set up weird. Like decor and furniture wise. It felt cramped. No dresser? But two desks?  Like too much furniture with no purpose. 

BUT! The shower was great, the bed and bedding was sooo comfy. Slept like a champ. No noise from outside. And like I said the staff was great. And for the price, would def stay here again.  ",6,Alison,2024-07-24

"I never had problems with any Sheraton, they are always good. This one was surprise. First day was very hot and air condition did not cool, called them and they sent their person to reset the next day. They used a button inside that did no good to reset. Was still hot, I had to call many times to find solution. Their second hotel reset person said needs air conditioning company to come but unlikely they will call. I asked room change. The second room had the same issue, very hot and air condition problem, 
 they try to reset and not fix it. This also had flat floor of bathroom with the shower so, whenever you take shower, the bathroom gets flooded. 
The vent in bathroom not working.
Asked for change, they said no room but I had to really insist and get angry and two minutes later they had a room. They had two actually. The next room was normal.But I spent half of my stay with their issues, they don't have any urgency to fix your problem unless you really start getting angry. They refused through hotels com to give any day refund until now. They do nothing for you and save money, they wait first to see if you complain or not.
If you go to NY, I saw better hotels on Roosevelt Island with amazing city view, no reason to book in this area ",2,EFTIM,2024-07-17
"I paid my security deposit in cash, and the hotel stood me up for 50 mins since they didn't leave any comment or proof about it. Then they decided to send the money to me within a week. I could have been late if I got out of the hotel 2 hours ago. Luckily I checked out 3 hours 20 mins earlier, which made me safe to take an international flight.",8,Yookyung,2024-07-17
Our AC was broke the entire time. It was 80 degrees in our room the entire time. We reached out to management and to Sheraton corporate and nothing was done to accomodate us for our inconvenience and it took 3 days for anyone at the property to respond.  I will NEVER return.,2,SHONDA,2024-07-16

"Hotel overall is good, however, even though pool is advertised, it’s not available for the guests. Front desk staff not helpful much. I needed to switch the rooms due to horrible weed odor, shower not draining. The front desk told me they can switch the room, on the same floor which is easier for them. Room was downsize from what I booked. When I asked if I can get a mini fridge from my original room, front desk was “working” on it for 2 days. I finally asked random custodial personnel, who hooked me up within 5 minutes. Speaking of custodial team, they are top notch. Very helpful and friendly and do their job amazing. ",6,Boris,2024-07-14

"The Hotel is basic, very beige and old fashioned furniture. super small lobby with only 2 desks for check in /check out. No hand shower in the bathroom, only the old american shower head system. It is not amazing but it was ok until i had a very bad experience the last night. At around midnight I left my room for a short walk and when I came back half an hour later I couldn't access my room.
I was sent 3 times to my rooms with a new card until someone came with me to find out that the door didn't open.
It was between 12:30 and 1:00 in the night.
it took some time to contact the chief engineers to finally tell me that they won't be able to open my room until 8am in the morning!
At 1:45am he gave me another room for the night, I was sent to this new room without offering me a toothbrush or amenities.
Next morning at 8:00 the door wasn't fixed, I went to the front desk they called the engineers again. 8:30 nothing was done! I was waiting in the lobby! I had an important meeting to attend at 8:30 (It was a business trip).
15 min later still nothing! i had to go back constantly to the front desk to get ETA. they obviously didn't care at all that one of the customer couldn't access his room for 9 hours! I missed my meeting! my phone was in my room so I couldn't inform my colleagues. I also had to prepare my luggage as I was supposed to leave at 12:30 for the airport.

I arrived and had to h e my room changed a total of three times. I will not be staying at another Sheraton going forward this was the worse hotel I’ve stayed in. Not what I expected from a Sheraton/ Marriott brand the website and what I actually received was so far off it was like false advertising. Y’all got me this time it will not happen again. ,4,Vanessa,2024-03-18

"There was no outlet to plug my coffee machine into, and the safe didn’t work. I asked very nicely to transfer to a different room but I guess they didn’t have anything available. The conversation ended there. I also decided to extend my stay in Brooklyn and didn’t want the pain in the butt of going to a different hotel, so I asked to extend my stay, and they were wanting to charge me twice what I had paid a day unless I went through the rigmarole of doing it online, even though I am sure the guy totally could’ve done it. The vibe there is a bunch of people who hate their lives and jobs. The energy in there is stagnant and angry. I didn’t realize it until I went to another hotel. I wish I would’ve gone to another hotel. The first day I was there. ",2,Kirsten,2024-02-06

"I hosted my daughters Sweet 16th birthday here in 2012 in the banquet room. I booked the same room a 2-Qn bdrm suite. I checked in 4:30p went to cafe in lobby for food at 5p to surprisingly find it was closed. I remember the food at the hotel restaurant for breakfast was very good I figured I would be able to order something from there like a fruit or cheese platter and was shocked to find it was now a Chinese restaurant. I find it quite odd for a hotel to not have a restaurant that sells a variety of food since customers come from varied cultures. This leaves no sit down option for breakfast. I should not have to order food from outside, something as a basic as fruit platter or even a burger and fries are sold at major hotel chains especially in large cities like NYC. Apparently the hotel now has Asian owners because I noticed large amount of Asian staff including house keeping, cafe staff and only restaurant option Chinese. The front desk workers were the only 2 who were not. My issue was since it is under Asian ownership the only restaurant available serves Chinese food and the cafe that sold pastries, coffee etc closes too early. There’s a pathetic vending machine on the second floor that was only taking coins with no credit card option.
CON they do not have Apple Pay so if you book bring coins, cash and credit cards and poor food choices
PRO the suites are very spacious and it’s close to transportation and the city.",6,Tiffany,2024-01-23
"The hotel was very dirty. After checking in I noticed a large stain on one of the comforters. I politely told the hotel staff of the issue and they told me that they would send housekeeping up to change the bedding. I left and returned that evening and it had still not been fixed. I complained the next morning and was told again that hotel staff would fix the bedding issue. I again left and returned that evening to the situation still not being rectified. I went to the front desk with the issue and was told that I would be moved to a new room on a different floor. By this point I was fully unpacked for a week trip and was not offered any help or compensation for the issue other than a new room which I would have to repack and move to. The room also looked as if it was cleaned too quickly in that the coffee bar had not been restocked before I checked in. The shower also did not have a body wash dispenser and every light fixture had at least one lightbulb burnt out. All of these little things could have been over looked had they staff foxed my main issue in a more proactive way. I wont be staying here, ever again!  ",2,Dylan,2024-01-23

"From the wifi going in and out to the hotel restaurant being under construction when it was mentioned it was open to the phones not working to my TV not working (which was quickly fixed) to there not being a fridge in the room to housekeeping trying to get into my room TWICE with the “Privacy Please” sign on my door, there is a lot wrong with this hotel. But there are also a lot right as well!
These include the convenience to almost all Brooklyn based trains being within a 5 minute walk or under. These trains take you almost anywhere into the city/Manhattan or other parts of New York City. 
It also includes the surrounding area being quiet, especially at night. I rarely heard a sound. I was here for a week on the 19th floor and faintly heard ambulance sirens just twice during my stay. Pretty great for a location in New York City that is conveniently located!
The beds also are comfy, besides one area on the edge of the beds where people probably sit the most. This area was sunken in on both beds. So I assume the beds are old and haven’t been replaced. But besides that area, the bedding is comfortable.
Lastly, most of the staff is friendly and attentive. There is one lady at the front desk who seemed she was just there to get her paycheck, but most everyone else was nice. ",6,Kadeem,2023-12-18

"We were a family of 5 at the hotel. The sofa bed had a very old and extremely flat matress. You were feeling the mattress rings. I have tried to call the front desk and the room phone was not working. We had to go downstairs to request assistance. The mattress was not replaced, we had to place comforters(stained ones) to mitigate the uncomfortable mattress. Not to mention that we paid almost $600 a night. 
We were not allowed to take breakfast. The hotel is under construction and the breakfast area is not working. They send you to another place to take the breakfast only if you pay the rate of $50 per person.

"New York er dyrt og derfor er den generelle kvalitet OK for at kunne bo i Brooklyn for ca DKK 10000 for en uge. Når det er sagt så er fællesområder - lounge, vestibule mm stort set ikke eksisterende. Det er ikke Sheraton standard, som vi normalt kender det. Receptionspersonalet virker umotiverede; hilser ikke - er ikke imødekommende, og vi brugte dem ikke en eneste gang til at spørge om sites, restauranter mm. Vi boede på 4. sal og i Europa - der går man på trapper. Den ene trappegang var spærret indtil reception og den anden var en brandtrappe. Ingen skiltning eller forklaring. Vi ankom kl 23 en søndag og ham på vagt could not care less. B.la. informerede han os om, at hotellet ikke serverede morgenmad. Det viste sig senere, at det kan man tilkøbe for USD 50/person.
Værelset fint. Stedet godt beliggende og rengøring og værelse helt fint. I øvrigt skulle man overveje at sætte rengøringspersonalet i front. Søde og smilende:)",8,Jan Lindgaard,2023-08-24

My tv in room didn’t work. They didn’t serve breakfast and shower stream was weak. Maybe because I was on the top floor of the hotel.

At 3/4 temp it would go back and forth between low and medium-strong pressure, cycling every couple seconds. Really unfortunate since I’d just run a half marathon in the rain and was desperate for a good hot shower. ",6,Margaret,2023-05-21

"Clean enough and the room was nice enough. Staff was helpful. Location was great for my purposes. Reasonbly affordable for NYC. Some issues though:

- Shower water pressure was dismal and just sort of dribbled. I told the desk and a maintenance person came up but no improvement.
- HVAC was stuck and 75 heat and could not be turned down or off. I understand this may be a building-wide issue at this time.
- Pool closed to guests.
- My room did not have any hotel literature - listing of amenities, room service menu, breakfast details, local dining. I was also missing the ""do not disturb"" hangtag although other rooms seemed to have them, so cleaning would try to get in while the room was occupied.

So, not actively terrible but not what I usually expect at a Sheraton brand hotel.",6,Jan,2023-03-28

*In our room the TV and fridge did not work. Check these immediately upon arrival. They offered to replace the TV but we did not want them to bother with it. But if it's not working right when you check in you could probably just switch rooms easily.",8,Kristin,2023-03-15

"Chose this place because of location (near Barclays), but basically everything else failed us.

CONs first:
The first impression of the lobby is that it is crowded. A spacious lobby is UNnecessary for me to rate a motel 5 stars, but come on, this is Sheraton, one of Marriot's PREMIUM branches.

I tried to use the ball pen. Neither clicking nor rotating worked. I disparted the pen, and the next second I LITERALLY KECKED: there was disgusting colorless liquid (but definitely not water/H2O) in the pen.

I then noticed that there was only 1 free bottle of water in the room, while I signed up for 2 guests.

I called Room Service using the room's phone, and the person who answered my phone told me that I should dial another number to get those. The number led to nobody and was transferred to the lobby. I was then told that I could refill my water at the restaurant, which had limited hours of opening. Fine.

We stayed in a room for about 30 mins, but no pen or  Aquafina was delivered.

The last con (it usually matters to me, but it became not that important compared to what I had experienced already): the room is relatively Dark&Low.

I happened to live in a motel for more than a year, and the people there were more professional, friendly, and responsive than the ones working at this property on Feb. 17th of 2023.

Pros:
- The elevator is fast, super fast.
- There is a cafe connected to the lobby and their staff refilled my bottle.
