"We stayed in this hotel for one night while traveling.  Hotel and rooms were clean and pleasant, staff was friendly and efficient, and location along the river, with several restaurants within walking distance, was great.",10,Andrew,2025-08-17
I had the worst customer service experience I have ever had in my 25+ years of traveling for business. I travel often to West Virginia and I will never stay at this location again. I urge you to book elsewhere and give your business to a hotel management that will look at you as a person and not a policy.,2,Tiffany,2025-08-14

Love the room and property but honestly parking is kind of a pain. ,10,Emilie,2025-07-29
"Additional fee for parking even though I had told the receptionist I didnt park in the parking area. Wifi was very spotty even after midnight to 3a.m with im guessing minimal usage from other guests it somehow got so bad to the point i couldn't connect and the tv would randomly restart itself. On a better note, I was put into a room on the peasants top floor, decent view of the streets and hills. ",4,Nicholas,2025-07-27
"We were checked in by a brand-new clerk who was articulate, welcoming, and didn’t miss a beat. The hotel’s location on the Monangahela River allowed us to get an early morning run in on the adjacent trail. All parts of the property were well-maintained.",10,Kristin,2025-07-23

"The hotel was very nice and the staff were incredibly helpful and pleasant. The beds were pretty uncomfortable and the A/C in the room did not cool well. The parkimg deck is quite a hike to the front of the hotel where the elevators are, so that was a bit of a hassle.",6,Virginia,2025-06-14

"Hotel appeared to be severely understaffed.  My wife and I went to the bar and restaurant on the first evening and were never approached by any waitress or waiter.  We went to the bar and again were never served. So we just left and never went back for the remainder of our stay.  
Housekeeping only serviced the room on the first day of our stay and never returned the other days.  Very disappointed with service. ",10,Mark,2025-05-19

"The bed and pillows were comfortable; the room was clean and in good condition. Loved the Starbucks in the lobby and the in-house restaurant was reasonable and good!  Also loved the parking garage that connected to the hotel. The only thing I did not care for was the service requested for the beverage refrigerator, since my friend and I did not know how to work it and there were no instructions.  We didn't know you had to press ""Quick Cool"" and then open and then shut the door.  The service person was a bit rude/grumpy that he had to come up and show us.  There were no instructions, unless they were hidden in a book.  We had pressed ""Quick Cool"" but did not know it was a requirement to open the door and then shut it.  Also, the icemaker on the 8th floor was not working.  ",8,Debra,2025-05-04
My big down fall to this stay which brings the score down for this hotel......the hotel cleaning staff stole my watch. I called 4 times the day I lost my watch. The 1st staff member I talked to was hard to understand  do to her accent. I dont know if they found the watch or sent a ticket in for the staff to look for it. The only ticket I got was for my readers. For the very Low price of 50$ i could get them shipped backto me. I called back after this ticket the person said to give it another day or two. I called back today they house cleaning staff never found the watch. I know exactly wear i left it in the room. I also left a 40$ tip for the house cleaning staff. It will be a long time before I stay at a marriott again. I will never stay at the Marriott in Morganton.  ,2,Kimberly Mohler,2025-05-02

"The room did not heat up to the thermostat.  The side of the bed next to the window was very cold and the floor was extremely cold to my feet. 

The bathroom faucet needs to be adjusted.  When the faucet was pointed to 4 o'clock and open wide, the water was uncomfortably hot!  When the faucet was pointed to 8 o'clock the water was scalding!

"The good: great location, friendly check in and friendly service at the restaurant. The room was modern and elegant.

The bad: the food in the restaurant was mediocre to bad and the room service breakfast was  a thorough disappointment. Should have brought my own. This is what I got for $33.00! The oats were especially disgusting and tasted like they were microwaved right in the mushy paper cup they came in.",6,Dennis,2025-02-05

"They are doing HEAVY remodeling. Parking is behind the building and you no longer can cut thru the conference center, so I had to walk clear around the property. Waited minutes for a customer service person to check us in. There should have been signage or a warning that this was in such a condition. It really ruined a nice stay for a special occasion. For what you pay, it was a huge disappointment. ",6,Megan,2025-01-12

You have to park your car in their parking garage and since one side of the hotel is under repair you can't walk through where you park so you have to walk about half a mile back to where you check in at. I truly feel sorry for anybody older as I don't know how they do it. ,4,John,2024-12-19

"Parking garage far, construction in progress so no access to building from the garage. You have to walk down and around the levels of garage and out the gate and around the building. It was a lot of walking. Person at desk at check in did not provide any information regarding this. Getting there at 2 am with 3 children and suitcases after a 6 hour drive this was very frustrating to figure out on my own especially in the cold weather. ",4,Jenna,2024-12-15

No gift at check in :(
It's a long walk from the parking garage to the elevators for the rooms. Luggage carts or a little more of a briefing about the quarter of a mile walk would be much appreciated.. oh there are some homeless encampments along the river.",10,Rebecca,2024-10-07

I checked into the room and sent my wife pictures for her approval and it was a definite ""Thumbs Up.""  The room was spotless.  The shower had more than enough pressure.  There was plenty of linen.  There was an extra blanket (for my wife) and the overall experience was the best.  We are already planning to stay there again next year.",10,Anthony,2024-10-07

The front desk attendant has to unlock our door every time we leave the room because the key doesn’t work and only the master key will unlock. Pool area was extremely hot. Bed is very stylish, yet very uncomfortable with a cheap, thin mattress. The large bathroom is the best part of the room. ",4,Justin,2024-07-20

The refrigerator in our room was not working.  We called several times to the front desk and no one ever came.  At midnight the best suggestion the front desk has was to change our room which was unacceptable to move with two teenage girls who needed sleep for a dance competition the next morning.  ,4,Amy,2024-05-05
"Came to town to visit family and wanted to see this impressive hotel that was built just before we moved away.  We didn’t really take advantage of all the amenities, but it is modern and comfortable and the bar/restaurant staff are great. There was some small, occasional ticking sound near the entrance of our room that seemed to be caused by vibration in the walls, and there isn’t an option for less lighting in the bathroom. Overall, though, it was one of the best hotel stays we’ve experienced!",8,Linda,2024-05-02
"We arrived late (early morning, 3am) and were promptly assisted with check in. They usually end check-in at 1am, but we called and Alex at the desk was more than accomodating. We didnt get a chance to tour the property, but keep in mind that the LONG walk from the parking garage gives you a nice tour of their beautiful event center. Breakfast was great, but probably wouldnt pay $20 per person for it on a usual day. We paid for the convenience. Overall, the hotel was clean and comfortable and we slept well. The water pressure will change your life, its amazing! Will definitely be back.",10,Kim,2024-04-30

The hotel was very nice my only complaint was that we booked a double queen and were given a king suite… which normally wouldn’t be a problem but we were there for a cheer competition and it was me and another mom with our kids.. we kinda needed the other bed when we called they gave us nothing other then that the room we were given was more expensive then our originally booked room but that did not help the fact that we needed two bed it was ver un comfortable for a $250 room,6,Minda,2024-03-10
"perfect location, staff is excellent.  Could not plug 
in the hair drier in the bathroom outlet (tried 2 different hair driers).  Had to dry my hair in front of a TV and not a mirror.  Called before I booked to ask about pool and hot tub being 
operational and they said they were but hot tub was not working and was not working last time I stayed there.  not crazy about having to walk such a long way to park car.  ",8,Patti,2024-03-07

Stayed here for the first time for our daughter's WVU graduation.  Very nice room.  Loved that we got daily maid service.  Enjoyed the on site restaurant.  Enjoyed the workout room.  Loved the walking path being right there. Reason we can't give it 5 stars:  pool was really dirty.  We also don't like the barn door type doors for the bathroom and lack of a safe in the room.,8,jay m,2023-12-18

"I have stayed in nice hotels and not so nice hotels... the mattress was awful,  the sheets were worn out and not comfortable.  The shower leaked and the AC unit in the room was loud.",6,stacy,2023-11-10

"Absolutely perfect. Clean, spacious room. Very comfortable beds. Great bar area with fantastic service and a good vibe. Walked to dinner down the path along the river. Lots of great dining/bar options. I will stay here whenever I’m in Morgantown if possible! ",10,Jennifer,2023-10-09
Booked a room that wasn’t available and instead of sleeping on a king we have two full beds. ,4,Samantha,2023-10-08

"Mold, unhelpful staff, terrible service. When arriving in the room I found mold all over the shower. I asked the front desk to please clean the shower so that I could use it (I'm not in college, I didn't bring flip flops) they said they would ask housekeeping to do so. Housekeeping not only did not clean the bathroom, they did not make the bed, they did not take away used glasses and replace them with fresh ones. I complained each day that there was mold and it needed to be fixed or that I needed a different room and the answer was always the same ""I'm sorry for that, let us see if we can fix it"" which they never did. I am beyond disappointed in this hotel chain and their lack of general standards for cleanliness. I would never stay at this location again. ",2,Eric,2023-10-05
