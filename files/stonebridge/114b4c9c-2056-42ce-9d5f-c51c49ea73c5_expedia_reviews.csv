"We came here after leaving the nearby Quality Inn due to lack of hot water. This transition was night and day!!! The breakfast at the Hilton has hot food and protein.  Our hotel room was spotless upon arrival, and the bathroom provides really great Shampoo, Conditioner, Body Wash, and Body Lotion. People actually hung out in the lobby because it was comfortable and had games. There were water bottle filling stations at each water fountain. The tv was great as we brought our firestick and could watch movies in bed. Parking was great, and you could walk to a bunch of great food options and bars.  All in all, we have come to realize we would rather book with Hilton than risk it at the other affordable options. There seems to be a consistency that they have their bases covered and helpful staff. ",10,Hannah,2025-09-28

"Very nice stay. The room was clean, and the staff was friendly. The area was pretty quiet, despite being in a busy road so occasionally we would hear loud cars. Breakfast was fine, nothing super different from other hotels, and could perhaps have benefitted from fresher fruit. I loved all the places to hang towels in our room, and we enjoyed the many doggie guests. Would definitely stay again.",10,Deyna,2025-09-21

I would have given 5 stars but there was no storage to put your clothing . No closets no drawers they had 3 hangers on a rack and a few hooks so we lived out of the suitcase which I didn’t like but oh well. I also hated the pillows they were super soft and became flat bed was comfortable though . Everything else was great.,8,Stephanie,2025-09-17
"Reasonably priced with free breakfast, a comfortable bed and good water pressure in the shower. What more could you want?",10,Michael,2025-09-16
Could be better with the new carpet and clean bed sheets ,6,Shahrokh,2025-09-15
"I’ve stayed here multiple times. I love the location because it’s center to all I like to do when in town. The staff is decent. The pool area could use better monitoring with children. I wish they would expand balcony access. Otherwise, I’ll be back.",8,Shara,2025-09-15
"There was an issue at check in. I clearly booked two rooms from Expedia but the staff repeatedly said that I had just one room booked in the system. After contacting a manger and going back and forth for nearly 30 minutes, the reservation was found. Check in should not have taken so long. It was also prepaid which i clearly demonstrated. The hotel was very nice though just loud, but that was due to bike week. ",8,Aaron,2025-09-14

"For all the wonderful things that other reviewers had said about the breakfast, we found it to be completely substandard and lacking anything that seem to be remotely fresh. It ended up being so bad that we decided to skip having breakfast at the hotel and go out to a restaurant one day. Also, our air conditioner in our bedroom Was so loud and rattled so much that we actually tried to remove the cover and see if that would help. All in all it was a fairly big waste of money and I am quite sure will not return to this hotel if we stay in Ocean City again.",2,Timothy,2025-08-10

"We enjoyed our stay in Ocean City. We stayed at several resorts and will definitely consider coming back to this one. We really enjoyed the area off of the pool and the cleanliness of the hotel. There was good water pressure, comfortable beds. and we enjoyed the water and ice refill station. The breakfast could have been better and the rooms could’ve been quieter. You could literally hear everything going on in the next room. However, overall, it was a great stay. I highly recommend it.",10,Amy,2025-07-28

Excellent and you cannot beat the daily free breakfast buffet…very awesome. Also great location close to restaurants and boardwalk.,10,Taeyma,2025-05-16
The employees seem like they could care less. I needed more tiles and I was told that I would have to bring them towels from my room to get clean towels. Also employees did not seem very friendly whatsoever. None of them acknowledged anyone except for the check in person at the front desk.,4,Mark,2025-05-13
"I have stayed this property several times, but this time was a disappointment as I felt very uncomfortable. First, my room was not. I spoke to the person at the front desk who apologized. I mentioned there was no toilet paper at which another person handed me a role. What surprise me most was the male employees we’re not friendly at all. One who I believe worked there did nothing but hang out around at the check-in desk eating and a front desk person, who has been working there for at least a few years was always talking on her phone while it was on speaker, which is very uncourteous when people were waiting to check in. I suggest more training is necessary.",6,Mark,2025-05-13

"The room was super small- lacking even a closet- just a couple of hooks on the wall. There was no microwave and the only other piece of furniture( besides bed and built in tables) was an office chair. No comfortable place to sit, no extra pillows or blankets. The room was just a dissapointment for the price and location for a Hilton Hotel. The staff always formed a little huddle at the front desk eating from morning buffet or take out. There was no toilet paper in the downstairs bathrooms- I did inform front desk.   Also not asked for car info and noticed non guest ( I asked) parking in prime spaces attracting the noise and attention  of very loud auto show partcipants passing by until after 2:00 in the morning. This was definitely my first and last stay at a Hilton Tru.


",6,Cheryl,2025-05-05
"This is our first stay at the Tru by Hilton in Ocean City.

The gentleman who checked us in was very polite; a young, tall, slim African American man who was so nice and greeted us each time we came/left the hotel. He's actually the only staff that did that.

The continental breakfast was fantastic! Eggs, hashbrowns, sausage, french toast sticks, pancakes, fruit, toast, etc. Plenty of options for many diets. And very clean dining area. Best breakfast compared to other hotels we've stayed in by far.

The rooms are nice. The biggest issue is the soap dispenser in the bathroom - you have to squeeze the sides and this may be difficult for those with hand injuries or arthritis, so keep that in mind. A simple small bar of soap would suffice. Rooms are clean, but don't have a microwave. The mini fridge doesn't have a freezer either. There's coffee and a convenience-style market by the check in for those needing snacks or items. The hotel is close to many restaurants as well in walking distance.

Overall, we've enjoyed our stay here and appreciate the clean, open room.",10,Tiffany,2025-05-04
"LOVE tru by Hilton!! This is the second location I have stayed at. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of booking a different hotel during my vacation that was dirty and unbearable to stay in. Tru by Hilton saved my vacation by being affordable and clean - I was even able to check in 30 minutes early. Staff was friendly and gave food recommendations that were nearby the hotel. I will continue to book with Hilton as much as I can when I take trips. Always clean & professional. ",10,Calista,2025-05-01

Room was tidy and clean and all employees was had contact with were very friendly.  With it being pet friendly our 2
small pets went with us. We will be staying there when we come back to Ocean City MD.

This hotel was lovely and sooo clean! Our room and bathroom were immaculate which we appreciated. The shower was nice and roomy. The staff was also very kind and friendly. And the breakfast was fantastic! It was really good and one of the better free breakfasts we’ve had at a hotel.  My only complaint is that the mattress was too soft for my liking. I have back issues so the soft mattress was not comfortable for me but may be just right for someone who likes a soft bed! ,10,Kia,2025-02-18

"All in All a Nice Stay!  Very Clean which was a Plus!  Rooms where Small glad I booked two queens !  Did not like that there was no microwave in the Room or Coffee Pot (Keurig) There was a breakfast buffet and free coffee and tea but if you didn’t drink it fast it would get cold and when taken to the room no microwave to warm up!  The Raisin Bread was Hard and Bagels tasted fake, had to ask for milk each morning for the cereal and cream cheese for bagels , the eggs tasted powdery, there was a bowl of apples that where brown that looked like they had been there for weeks!  Did enjoy the cereal options after we got the Milk we had to ask for!  The Prices on the Snacks and Microwave Food was Ridiculous, $5 for a cup of Ramen Noodles !  Did not like the Soap in Tubes in the Room the one leaked all in the Shower Floor and I had to wipe up so we wouldn’t slip on it!  The Thermostat in Room seemed to be controlled somehow as we would set it on temp for it to get warm and it would blow cold we had to put pillow over the vent or just turn off!  There was No closet to hang clothing just some hooks on the wall which was weird!  Hope this Helps with improving Guest Accommodations! ",6,Paula,2025-01-03

The hotel thinks it's standard height for a handicap bed is knee high well when your husband is 6/5 one leg two toes well it's not possible to get up from a bed so low. We were offered another handicap room bed same size ...we were then taken to different rooms were his wheelchair could somewhat get around the room which was very very limited we were crunched in like sardines the full 4 days we were there we had no handicap bars for him to use in the bathroom he had NO way of getting a shower we had to go to a convenient store for him to take a bowl movement cause ALL the toilet in the hotel were low. This place and other hotels need a good revision on accomodations on handicap situations. I will be dealing with this more with someone because this happens to us ALL the time.,2,Andrea,2024-12-02
"This hotel was near perfect! The ONLY thing I would request is that they keep the coffee and hot water thermals fresher overnight. Why can't I have a fresh cup of coffee overnight too? It isn't busy and the staff is sitting right there behind the desk watching TV. Four hours (or more) old ""free"" coffee to me is unacceptable. Even in the thermals it wasn't hot after sitting for so long. Same with the hot water for tea and hot chocolate. Luke warm at best! Just please make coffee more often overnight so it is fresh. They definitely have the time to do it. Besides that, it was the only negative thing I could say about my 2 night stay. Everything else was great! I saw a few reviews about the size of the rooms but you are staying in a hotel to sleep. How much time are you going to actually spend in there? They are the perfect size for what you need it to be, although we didn't have kids with us either. Water pressure was good in the bathroom, beds were comfy, breakfast was delicious and great location. Right next door to a Burger King or there are so many places to eat, shop and explore within walking distance. The beach is right across the street too. Do not jaywalk. I will definitely be staying here again!! Thank you so much!! It was nice to relax in your hotel on my little mini vacation! ",10,Jamille,2024-12-02

"Nice facility.
Indoor pool felt cold , but was told the room is set at 89° & the pool water at 86°, making it feel cold once in the water.
The room itself was rather plane. No dresser or drawers to put clothes into. Air while sleeping VERY DRY (need to have something to drink next to the bed, otherwise you'll get a dried out throat & sinuses.
Breakfast was nice but crowded.
Car Chargers did not work, but was told they do not own them, it's an outside company that maintains them.
Nice location, just about 5-10, but there are stores you could stop in on the way.",10,Charles,2024-12-02
good experience. good view. some of the toiletries were missing from the bathroom but were quickly remedied by the front desk. the bed was less comfortable than I would've liked but I don't count that as a fault of the hotel. I'm just used to my own bed.,8,Julian,2024-12-02

Property was a great price for free parking and free breakfast. Pool was a little disappointing and there was no microwave in room so you had to go to the lobby to heat stuff up. Also they only had 2 sets of linens and there was 2 of us. Liked the lobby games and animals. Also loved all the seating in the front lobby. Room was a little small but good for the price. ,8,Dezirae,2024-11-11

",4,Mary j,2024-10-09
"I had stayed here one other time before and the reasons I chose it again was because Expedia gave me a good deal, it has an indoor pool and last time was very convenient to where I needed to be. We had gone down for Winterfest Lights and I would recommend staying at this hotel if you are going to that or the convention center. Unfortunately this time they had some issues with the pool but got them quickly resolved. The manager is also very nice. I have food allergies so the breakfast choices weren't good for me (was really hoping to have bacon one of the 4 days there) but my allergies are not the hotel's issue. The only thing I had a problem with was I had my son along who has a sleep disorder and he takes longer to get up and get moving. The first two days he made it, the third day he was down at 9:53 and everything was put away and the fourth day he was down at 9:45 and the girl was removing the spoons and the food. He was able to grab some scrambled eggs and a piece of chicken sausage but the breakfast potatoes were removed before he had a chance to get them. I feel if you have breakfast from 6-10 then you don't start tearing it down until 10:01.",6,Lori,2024-10-01

The front desk staff wasn’t very interactive and didn’t seem entirely thrilled to be there or didn’t want to be bothered. The breakfast was plain and the breakfast area was always cluttered and dirty (along with the coffee area). The room service every other day was odd and left a lot of garbage in the room and dirty towels. When we did get room service, a few items weren’t replaced or soap/toilet paper wasn’t refilled. There were rooms nearby with dogs also that were very loud and annoying (should only be in certain areas). Overall it was a good stay just needs a few improvements. ",8,Stephanie,2024-08-28

The a/c in the room didn't work as it should have, but it at least kept it at a temperature that was sleepable.  The thermostat was at 76 or above at all times and when turned down, it would not adjust the temperature of the room.

The room was clean and location super close to beach and restaurants. The breakfast was excellent with yummy pancakes. After a fun boardwalk walk you can cool off in pool.,10,dana,2024-06-23
"The floor was extremely sandy. The bathroom door would not close easily and once it was closed, it was very hard to open. An elderly person or someone without much strength would have a dangerous time trying to open the door from inside the bathroom if need be. 

Aside from that, the room did its job. The mattress was very hard but I suppose that is expected. 

The staff were very prompt and accommodating. ",8,Alonzo,2024-06-23

"I liked the breakfast which had a home style pot of oatmeal with almonds & raisins.  I disliked the scrambled and hard boiled eggs which tasted imitation.
I disliked the lack of basic items in the room including no microwave, no soapshelf in the shower, no washcloths (The housekeeper said that the hotel doesn't have many washcloths when my neighbor and myself complained to her.).
Also, the people on my floor were speaking loudly at night twice at nighttime in the hallway and at 1:30 pm. 
It's what the hotel doesn't have which is weird.",6,Anne,2024-05-31

"We got down a little eary and they were able to accomodate us.  Everything was clean and bright.  Our room as well was clean, bright, and I loved the hard wood floors.  The bathroom was clean and bright, and just like new.  There was no tub but that was not a big deal for us.  We had a beautiful walk in shower.  The mini fridge was a bit small, but fit our 2 gallons of water.  Breakfast was from 6-9:30 in the morning but we noticed Monday morning before we left they seemed to accomodate a little later.  After all the travelling we've done the last 6 months, the french toast was a pleasant surprise and my daughter loved the automatic pancake maker.

There was a beach access on 33rd, but we crossed and used the beach access on 32nd.  The hotel is a convenient walk to Higgins or Shotti's, and my daughter loved OC Wasabi across the street.

The pool area was clean the night we went up.  Although the room was warm, my daughter said the water was on the cooler side.

The only issue we had was that the parking spots did not quite fit our truck.",10,Elisabeth,2024-05-07

"Our stay was nice. I will say issues we did have was the room should have been cleaner. The comforters on the two beds you could have have NOT been cleaned in a while. I picked up the two mattresses to check anything funny in bed and it was all dirty under each mattress and around the sides of the bed. There was chips, hair, candy all smashed. The desk in room all stained on the top too. Bathroom very nice but adjusents on shower can hurt someone. The hot water is tricky to control. I will add the staff is AWESOME...Onlly other thing was it would have been nice to know you can't smoke outside on pool outside terrace after 10pm at night and that was a drawback. Also the pool could have been much hotter since indoor.",8,francesco,2024-04-26

Let’s talk about the pool!! It was disgusting- the water was so cloudy you couldn’t even see the bottom, water was cold and area around the pool was dirty and all not maintained at all. When I talked to the front desk they said IT WAS FINE!! 
Let’s talk about the lobby - we went to sit down and play a game the cube chairs are all stained- they swing chairs same thing all stained.  You wouldn’t want to sit there. 
Breakfast was chopped hot dogs eggs - hard bagels amd coffee was terrible

Bathroom fan pulled in someones weed smoke it was disgusting.,4,Christina,2024-03-30
"Very clean and comfortable! The amenities were great as well. The surroundings stores were convenient and there was a bus stop right in front of the hotel, again very convenient.

As she continued to raise her voice at me (in front of other guests) she would not let me even speak after that! It was EMBARRASSING and I was livid! It was late and we had been driving for 15 hours or I would have just left! I will NEVER go to another Hilton hotel if that’s how they treat people with medical issues that need a service animal!

Their system had just come back up from being down so check in ran a little slower than normal. Room was clean but the fridge could have been colder and you have to request a microwave. Smh i have never heard of that but okay. That was inconvenient. The next morning we went down at 6 for breakfast because its from 6 to 930 and no breakfast. We sat in the lobby thinking they just running late, things happen and nothing. We never saw a soul. No one at front desk and no kitchen staff working. We waited until 630 and decided to order out. Very disappointing. Room was smaller than i had expected for it to be a king. I will not be staying again. I did enjoy the indoor pool. Very clean and warm. Only thing i missed was a hot tub.

There was a cheer convention and the kids were allowed to run the whole place . We didn't even take part in the breakfast or amenities because everything was a huge play ground!! The halls were filled with trash , Kids were banging on doors, and playing in the elevators so you had to wait and wait and wait to even be able to get on there was absolutely no supervision and the hotel did nothing to try to contain this.

I thought all of the staff that was on during my stay were all very nice and willing to help. The breakfast had a good selection and I enjoyed it very much. I also really liked that there was hand soap in the rooms as I’m not used to hotels providing gel hand soap. I also liked that the soap and shampoo and conditioner were in little dispensers instead of the typical hotel sized bottles that I’m sure go to waste all the time. Parking was easy as was check in and check out. The pool area was very nice and clean. The only thing I did not like was that we were right next to the stairs so anytime someone used the stairs the door slammed pretty loudly which was pretty annoying while trying to sleep. Overall though I really liked this property and will definitely be considering it again when looking for a hotel in Ocean City.,10,Kristi,2023-12-23

Timing this year for a parking spot was much more convenient  daily charge was just waived, although nearly booked much of this time.

I walked into the lobby with my fiancé and there 2 employees there one was on the phone with a customer and the other was on her cell phone completely ignoring us. We stood there for maybe 5 to 10 minutes while the women spoke to each other and never addressed us when we finally were addressed by one of them the woman asked for my id and that was it. She was rude and rolled her eyes when I put my card for the incidental hold. Our room was clean and the air conditioning great. The elevator broke on our floor so we ended up taking the stairs most of the time luckily we were on the second floor and didn’t have far to go. My fiancé hated the shampoo. House keeping did an amazing job for a beach hotel to have zero sand in the room is amazing.,2,Faith,2023-08-27
Hotel was nice and the location great - close to beach and dining/shopping.  A bit loud (road noise) and the music that plays around the hotel was on all night on the room floors - I guess it wasn’t turned off as it should have been.  The breakfast was okay - the eggs had an odd taste so we skipped it the morning of checkout.  Staff attentive and friendly! ,8,Alison,2023-08-27

"The location is good. Even though you cannot see the beach in your room but you can just walk to the beach by crossing a road. The room is fantactis. I ordered a big bed and I am very surprised that it is KING Size!!! The hotel room has everything you need. and the check out is super super fast, you just need to tell your room number and give the card back to the front tesk. I really enjoy staying here. They provide declisious breakfast in the morning untill 10:30AM. I will definitley come back some day! ",10,Yiqiao,2023-08-26

Filthy shower, dirty bed sheets, hair all around sink faucet, spots on mirror and to top it off bed was uncomfortable and room temperature was TOO COLD. Horrible experience. Even front desk attendant was extremely rude, they were out of antibacterial Wilkes
Down stairs and I asked for some and her rude response was ""we out"". I asked about the pool and she stated ""fourth floor"", when I was referring to a pool table. This was by far the dirtiest lobby as well. ",2,Erica,2023-08-03

"We made a reservation for 2 nights and 3 days. In the bathroom, there was no conditioner, so I had to wash my hair without conditioner. I came out and asked the front desk, but they said it was out of it. I don't know if this is true, and I don't know if they can say that they don't have it, so take care of it. On the second day, I asked for a new towel, but it didn't come, so I asked three times, but in the end, they didn't bring it to the end. The fire alarm in the room kept beeping, so I told them, but it didn't solve it either, so I had to listen to the beeping all night and had trouble sleeping. As a result, it is a case of being provided with a service that does not solve anything.",4,MINA,2023-07-31

"We love this hotel! It is a pet friendly one and there weren’t any issues there. The staff were all very nice. Our room was very clean and the shower was excellent. They use Radio brand soaps where you gently squeeze the sides of the containers attached to the wall. I found them to smell terrific and be convenient; we never ran out of soap, shampoo, conditioner or body lotion. Breakfast was amazing! They have a pancake machine; you wave your hand in front of the eye, and it makes and places them on your plate! Scrambled eggs with and without cheese, breakfast meats (sausage links, patties, smoked kielbasa), cereals, yogurt, coffee….etc I can’t remember everything we had to choose from. Can you say “Yum!” We could walk to Jolly Roger amusement park in under 4 minutes where the hotel has discounted passes, which you purchase at the front desk for Splash Mountain, Speedworld, Mini Golf, Night Time unlimited rides or Day Time unlimited rides. The hotel is close to great food options and there is a small grocery store close as well. I could go on and on! Almost forgot they have an inside pool so you can swim there too. It’s a good idea to join Hilton Honors online which is completely free, before check in so you earn points for your stay and get a gift bag. This is an affordable hotel that I recommend for couples and families. ",10,Verified traveler,2023-07-16

No hand towels provided, had to request. No shower wash, just hand soap. Bathroom door scrapes the middle of the floor as you open and close. Sand was in the shower from previous usage. Again normally our stays at Tru are amazing with zero issues, hopefully this was just a 1 off stay.",8,Verified traveler,2023-07-14

Staff is also frequently smoking outside the entrance, which is very tacky. The friendliest, nicest staff person was an awesome cleaning person. Despite the disappointing staffing, the room itself was clean and modern with a nice view. Traffic noise can be a bit of an issue, but I think that is just Ocean City. ",8,Elisabeth,2023-07-04

There was a staff member by the name of Br3 who was a delight,helpful,& always smiling!
My family of 3 adult couples, 1 teenager and a puppy almost had an AMAZING stay, except for running into C@mille the day of our check out. The lobby, front desk & eating area are connected & it’s a dog-friendly hotel. During prior breakfast visits, we had no incidents and kept our puppy leashed and at our side on the floor (ankle ht).When Camille arrived on the day of our checkout, she told us that having the puppy in the food area was a health code violation, found it weird no one else had told us but still obliged politely to her keeping our puppy at the front desk “away from the food”. Naturally, our puppy was whining to be with us & squirming, so she asks if she may hold him, we said yes. Her co-worker comes over while I am putting powdered sugar on my pancakes & says that she has been trying to convince her boss (C@mille) to get a puppy for the front desk, then when we finish our plates, my husband approaches Camille to receive our puppy b4 me & by the time I arrive Camille had still not & refused to put our puppy into our extended arms - asking aggressively if he’s registered & moving away from us like if he wasn’t registered she could keep him. It was very strange and unacceptable behavior for a manager. ",8,Rachel,2023-06-28

I just paid $1375 for a stay what was $75 more dollars for a pet. She assumed I was trying to a avoid a fee.
