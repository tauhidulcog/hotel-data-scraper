"We stayed 2 nights. Nice and comfortable area for family.  Great breakfast too.  Parking fee is difficult to understand, which can be surprising for guests unaware of the fee. Overall nice staff and quiet area. Very close to hospital too.  ",8,Arnold,2025-08-13

"Front desk staff super! Breakfast every day was superb. Property very nice, clean, well taken care of. Accommodating on every level. Only issue was housekeeping did not do a refresher of our room during our entire visit. Had to go to the front desk to get cleans toweled/washcloths and amenities. Other than that, it was excellent!

"The room amd the bed was okay. The biggest issue was the bathroom. The tiles were all cracked and tje grout looked loose likely from water damage. There was even a soft spot by the tub (look out 236, you may see the tub from above in your bathroom). The bathroom sink was also slow to drain. My husband did not like the tv placement. The room is poorly designed from that perspective. The employees were very nice. Check in and out was easy.",8,Karla,2025-05-27

We’re a family or 5 and this hotel was easily accessible and worked perfectly for our night stay while we traveled across the country. We didn’t stay in the area long enough to know if it’s conveniently located for amenities or shopping but loved it nonetheless. ,10,Benjamin,2025-05-12

I felt the parking fee was unnecessary. We stayed here because my mom had a surgery in the morning and we live 3 hrs away. When I asked about the fee they said they charge it because all other hotels do in the area. ,8,Verified traveler,2025-04-18

"The woman who checked us in was SO fun and friendly.  
The room was very comfortable except that it was painfully hot.  We opened all the windows, but it was still 78 degrees after several hours.  It was about 30 degrees outside, but we had to run the AC overnight.  The stairwell close to our room had the heat blasting even though it was 60 degrees during the day.",10,Gina,2025-02-24

"We’ve stayed at this hotel before and came back because we really loved it. Unfortunately this trip we were in a room where the heat didn’t work and it also smelled really bad. We overlooked the smell, as we don’t expect perfection, but by the time our kids were getting in bed it was clear that the heat wasn’t working, by then we had unpacked and figured we could just deal with being cold for the night. I’m sure if we said something they would have made a room switch, as they seem very kind of accommodating but we just dealt with it. The front desk personnel and breakfast attendant were both really kind and we love this location, we will still come back but maybe check the heat before we unpack! ",6,Kendra,2024-11-28

"The hotel overall was great. Check in and check out were easy and both ladies were friendly and efficient, and also accommodating when we asked if there was any way to get a room on the top floor. The room was good, other than the bed. It was most definitely on the firmer side and left us older parents hurting. The pool was fun for our son. But the highlight of the stay was the breakfast and the amazing woman who made it possible.",8,Veronica,2024-11-03

It was fairly comfortable and had the amenities to use the stove which came in very handy. The only issue I had was the $12 daily fee for parking. According to the Loveland hotel guide from Welcome Center it advertised all hotels offered free parking. We will be at Townplace tonight and their parking is free. ,8,Jocelyn,2024-05-27
"Our room had visible stains on the bathroom wall that we wiped clean, as it looked like poop. The shower was leaking, and when we went in for breakfast (with still 40 min left) they had ran out of sausage and told us they would not be making more. That was pretty disappointing.

Quiet and no complaints about my kids being too loud. ,10,Desmond,2024-01-06
"This hotel is adjacent to a virtually abandoned outlet mall, and I got the sense that its not getting a lot of traffic itself. Since there weren't many guests, and we're not early risers, there was not much turnover on the breakfasts, so the main dishes were pretty cold by the time we got down there. Not really their fault, but... Overall the breakfast options were pretty decent.

Housekeeping was virtually non-existent. There was supposed to be one on the third day, but no cleaning appeared to have been done, though the bed was made.

Turning on the TV was very encouraging. There were options for streaming services including YouTube and Netflix, plus a bluetooth option. None of them worked. called the desk, apparently enabling this options happens in the future.

I really liked the comfort of the bed.
The thing on the bottom of the dishwasher that spins around was broken and partially melted.
Crack in the face of the microwave.

Lots of drawers everywhere, but they are pretty old, especially in the bathroom showing wear.

The price was reasonable. ",8,Thomas,2023-12-18

"Good experience and comfortable. The only negative was paying for parking. No cameras in the parking lot, just a security car that came by a few times a night. ",10,Clay,2023-11-16
"All was good, except the parking lot could use a little attention… especially since they charge $12.00 per day to park. Not covered parking, just regular parking lot with pot holes. ",10,Teresa,2023-10-15

There was a lot of shops around the property as well as restaurants.  Nice parks and art work to see. The hotel wasn't to bad but the fan in our bathroom was broke and they never got it fixed and it never looked like room service did anything in the room. ,4,Blake,2023-08-24

Love the staff! Everyone was so kind and helpful. Only complaint was the inconvenience of the pool being closed (one of the main reasons we booked here) and all the carpets being cleaned which left the floor in our room sticky and wet. I would say it was a minor inconvenience though and would definitely stay here again - because of the staff alone. Breakfast was also a big plus!,8,Marla,2023-05-27

"Dishwasher in room didn’t work. No room service. The one treadmill in fitness center didn’t work. You have to pay for parking, which is ridiculous. It’s Loveland. Staff was very friendly. When we checked in we were told we were lucky our reservation wasn’t cancelled because they were overbooked and Expedia overbooks rooms so they cancel the Expedia ones. So I will not be booking through Expedia in the future. We booked our other 2 rooms direct through Marriott and my husband is a loyalty member and that is probably why we got our room.

"We stayed in a two-bedroom suite for a volleyball tournament. For the price it was a bit basic. The pull-out couch has seen better days. Mattress in the main bedroom was very stiff, blankets were also on the thin side, and we hardly got any sleep. ",6,Yuliya,2023-03-28
