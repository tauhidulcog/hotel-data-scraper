Felt like home. Loved the one bedroom with living room and kitchen. Clean and quiet. Staff were friendly. Breakfast was good. A little annoying to pay for parking ($12 USD a day).,10,Kim,2025-10-07
We enjoyed our stay.  It was a one bedroom apartment and I so appreciated the layout!!  My daughter slept on the hideabed and we in the bedroom.  Loved the walk-in shower and also the soap selection in the shower!  The kitchen was stocked enough for us.,10,Tomme,2025-10-07

"Been staying at this hotel annually since 2008.  Missed a few years in between (during Covid, the reviews were not good so we stayed away, but visited ourselves on a recent trip to see how “bad” things were for ourselves and since they seemed fine, we have been coming back since).  Our last visit to town was 2 years ago and although the room space was still great, we noted how the finishes were showing their wear - carpeting in the hall, walls, etc.  This visit we were very happy to see that most surfaces have been redone and all the showers have been redone so now you can turn on the water BEFORE getting in, which is fantastic.  Always a great place to stay.
That said, it’s disappointing that you now have to pay for parking. ",10,Kristi,2025-09-11

"This was a return stay at this property. The location was good for what we needed, their spacious two bedroom/two bathroom on a previous stay was just what we needed so we made the decision to stay here again. Some how we always end up getting stuck right by the elevator wherever we stay and hear all the noises, so the only thing I asked when I checked in on this trip was, ""Please do not put us anywhere near the elevator."" I was told that the type of hotel room we booked is generally located around the elevator area (mind you it is a rather large hotel, so there has to be plenty of rooms away from the elevator) and she says that they NEVER get any noise complaints from the elevator. Assuming she had listened to my only request, we get the keys and head to our room....only to find that our room was literally the FIRST hotel room immediately left upon exciting the elevator. Like we couldn't get any closer to the elevator. We were checking in late, had spent 15 hours driving on the road, all I wanted to do was go to sleep so I didn't complain. Ohhhh how I should have asked for a new room. All I heard all night, EVERY single night for a full week as I tried to fall asleep was the mechanics of the elevator going up and down, all night long because our heads were literally on the same wall that shared the elevator shaft. Unbelievable horrible customer service and I now I don't care to ever stay here again, my only request was ignored and we suffered for it.",6,Jennifer,2025-09-04

"Got a two bedroom suite, it was perfect for the family. Beds were super comfortable abd service was fast abd polite. Plenty of close food options as well. Only disappointed in the pool and hot tub. As the pool was ice cold and the hot tub was out if service. Which the hot tub is one reason id picked the place. ",8,david,2025-09-02

We arrived with an 18 member soccer team for some pre-season training and the hotel stay was one of the many highlights. The Trio rooms were spacious and contained a full kitchen which helped save on meals. The pool and hot tub were delightful and they had a comfortable spot to hang out for our meetings or to just get out of the sun. Excellent stay!,10,Michael J Buensuceso,2025-08-22
"Loved the room!
Breakfast was great!
There are a dozen hotels nearby and you are the only one that charges for parking. You are already more than your neighbors, the parking fee means I will not be back.

"During our 5 day stay we saw 4 spiders, 2 inside the sheets. Housekeeping changed the sheets and vacuumed the room. We informed the front desk and they had maintenance spray outside our room which was on the first floor.  The pool water was very dirty, a lot of hair floating, we asked the front desk, they said it was cleaned that morning, but we were the first out there. The pool filters were off. Front desk said they would close the pool, but when other people arrived and kids just jumped in, it was left open. We found a splash pad nearby, had to pay, but it was clean.  The patio grills were very dirty, we asked for a brush to clean it, non was available, so we bought one in order to use the grill. Laundry room appliances do not get cleaned either.  On the positive side, we appreciate housekeeping staff, and the kitchen staff who served the buffet breakfast and were very helpful, hard working people. ",6,LETICIA,2025-08-02

"We were there due to my husband having a major surgery and we had to travel to Denver to get the surgery done and stay around the hospital once released for a few days to get cleared to travel again and make sure all is good! 
The only thing that I can say that was really bad for us was upstairs above us they had kids jumping literally continuously jumping during the day which was fine but it was still going on after midnight and my husband was sick but no one could of slept through that so I finally called the front desk just after midnight to complain which I never do and it still continued why the hotel puts kids on the upper floors don’t make sense the only reason we didn’t leave was because my husband was to sick. Staff was great, room great, hotel beautiful but that experience the last night was not good. We do love the hotel however and will come again but now I know to make sure no one is above us I guess. 😉",8,Tammy,2025-07-26

Dirty and outdated. Rude staff. We were placed in the incorrect room and were told we couldn’t be compt for it. It was a king booking and we were put in a queen bedroom with an a/c that leaked and the water in the kitchenette did not work. ,2,Neyda,2025-07-20

My friend and I have both given this hotel a second chance, and this time - the over charged exceeded almost $300.00 - why take more money from hardworking Americans to proof a point of greed??

"Hotel Rooms were very good and clean.
The issue started with unknow parking space cost. This information is not clearly stated neither here in Expedia, neither in the Hotel's website.
Next day we tried breakfast. We came down at 8:30 (BF is served until 10 on Wkend). There were not fruit, no yogurt, no milk, no bacon. Next day the same thing and the eggs were smelling very funny and when I told the responsible person about it, she exchange the Eggs ASAP with a very scared face.
We talked to the management hopping they would do something , but after talking to 2 people, they said they couldn't do anything.
Last but not least, pool heating was broken, no estimate time to fix (we were there for 10 days). Fire pit was not working and was not planned to fix it.
Clean service was very good as for the rest(management, front desk employee and breakfast staff) not so much. It felt like we were doing them a favor staying in the hotel.

"Hotel was reasonable. However, you are charged $12 per night to park your car in a normal, outdoor parking lot. I was not told about this when we checked in. Total surprise when I got the final bill. Expedia should also advise of this. Also, 2nd night there for several hours a kid in the room above was jumping all over the room’s floor and we heard thump, thump thump. Hotel tried to get them to stop but folks were very inconsiderate. ",6,Christopher,2025-05-27

"I knew they charged for parking when we booked the room however, all the warning signs about the hotel not being responsible for stolen items or vandalism made me feel like the area was unsafe. We didn’t have any problems but it was weird. The room itself was clean and the front staff were nice. They have guest laundry but it’s $6 for one load. We bought 3 sodas, a bottle of water, a bag of gummy worms and one Claritin and the total was almost $30. The nice thing is that there’s a Target close by and lots restaurants as well. Breakfast was mediocre but free. We are gamers and the tvs were a good size however the tv cabinets were glued to the wall so we had to buy an extension cord to hook up our Switch. Overall, it was a fair price for basically a two bedroom apartment. ",6,Hermelinda,2025-05-08

It does appear that some people are living here. The parking lot is riddled with trash, pee bottles etc. The hotel should have a designated smoky area other than the front of the hotel. 

The breakfast buffet could’ve been a success, but with only one person attending to it, there were a lot of issues. She really was trying to keep up, but she couldn’t. 

With some minor improvements, this could be a really great place! ",6,Stacey,2025-04-27

"There was an air conditioning vent that leaked above the door/entrance to our room.  We woke up to soaked shoes and coats on our first morning, we let staff know and maintenance supposedly came and fixed it.  That night it had a couple drips but nothing too bad.  The following night, it was back to a steady drip, but fortunately we had moved our stuff away from the door. But we had to put towels to try to absorb the mess and you could also hear the constant drip especially when trying to fall asleep.  It was just annoying that it was t fixed to start with.",6,Sarah,2025-04-12

" I recently had the pleasure of staying at Hyatt House, and overall, my experience was quite enjoyable. The hotel offered a welcoming atmosphere, comfortable accommodations, and a range of amenities that made my stay pleasant.

The room was spacious and well-appointed, featuring a cozy bed and a living area that allowed for relaxation after a long day. The complimentary breakfast was a delightful surprise, with a variety of options that catered to different tastes. The staff was friendly and attentive, always ready to assist with any inquiries or requests.

However, there was one aspect that could use some improvement: the kitchen cutlery and cooking tools. While I appreciated having a kitchenette in my room, the quality of the knives and cooking utensils left something to be desired. The knives were dull, making food preparation more challenging than it needed to be, and some of the cooking tools were either missing or not in the best condition. It would have been great to have a more complete and functional set of kitchenware to enhance the cooking experience.

Despite this minor setback, my overall stay at Hyatt House was positive. The hotel’s commitment to comfort and convenience is evident, and I would definitely consider returning in the future. If they could address the kitchen cutlery and cooking tools, it would elevate the experience even further. Highly recommended for travelers looking for a comfortable stay with a homely touch!",10,Adrian,2025-03-06

"Overall, nice property. The rooms were set up like a small apartment. Separate room, living area and kitchen. I loved the fact that it had a full kitchen including full size refrigerator, dishes, dishwasher, stove and oven. Microwave was not very powerful and there was no toaster. 

The interior is a little old, but it looks like they are making some updates. They were paining some areas. 

The gym is clean with multiple cardio options, free weights and resistance training equipment. 

The laundry room needs significant cleaning and updates. 

The free breakfast is okay. Didn’t care for the plastic silverware, but they did use glass plates. 

Price was reasonable, but the parking fee seems ridiculous since the area is not a congested area. 

Shopping is close. Lots of restaurants near by. It was very cold and snowed, so we didn’t have a chance to walk around. 

I will consider staying here again. ",8,Angela,2025-01-23

"I am very sad to write this as i have had such success with expedias properties. This is not a report on the staff. The staff were friendly. My flight changed and i arrived much earlier than planned. My daughter was vacationing with me. We decided to call the office to see if we could check in early. Multiple calls through thw number provided and no actual person was ever connected. After multiple calls, i decided to drive to the hotel. The front desk employee at that time was very short with me( the only instance of this) she said your room is not ready. Your check in is at 3. Ok fine. This brienf encounter allowed me to notice the construction going on. Turns out it was the entire 1st floor. When i returned at 3pm my daughter and i noticed a smell.it was strong and didnt smell pleasant at all. We checked in, went to get out luggage from the car. Attempted to enter thru the side wntrance closest to our car to save some steps. We swiped the key card opened the door and saw what could only be described visially as Mold. But it smelled like mold too. Not a little either. The entire lower half of was by the stairs. It was gross. I was in a bind. I couldnt leave the hotel because i didnt have the budget to just up and find another or the time.. we were not planning on being in the room much and thought lets just get through this. They were obviously working  on it. My only wish was that we were notified of the pending construction and closure of some of the amemities prior to arr",4,rosalie,2024-09-30

For a hotel to sell a stay in a room that was “unfinished” and didn’t have working TVs and obstructed fire detection was unsatisfactory. The crusted elevator grinded it’s way closed each time we used it and the pool area had leftover games spread all across it, connect four pieces and beanbag filling scattered all across the floor from a cornhole game.

The room was outdated, the room I requested and paid for was not the room we were given. They say they have a bar and grill but did not disclose it's temporary shut down the pool was gross and the hot tub was cold. The carpet was old torn. The couch had springs poking out. The kitchen faucet was broken only two forks and one spoon for a family of six. There was old food left in the microwave. Staff was rude and the pool room is hazardous and unlocked with children playing this is very dangerous. The way they trap people into booking is crazy nothing is accurate or up to date. The breakfast was disgusting cold and not what they advertised at all. This place is a rip off... ",2,Shawna,2024-08-12

I liked the location.  It's off the highway and easy to access. It's close to shopping and the light rail.  What I did not care for is housekeeping non-stop knocking on the door at 10am the day I was checking out. The hotel has a system letting housekeeping know which rooms have been checked out. I opened the door wearing a sports bra and the male housekeeper was way too excited with his nose against the door.  Not happy!,8,MELISSA,2024-07-17

"When cleaning during the week stay maids forgot about leaving toilet paper which we had none.  The iron Board was broken, The refrigerator was leaking water on top shelf.  The breakfast food was all carbs.  Nothing really healthy. Our keys were unable to let us into the pool area.  The umbrella's in the pool area were ripped or unusable.   In the weight room which is one of reasons for staying here was missing a lot of attachments to the multi cable machine  that made it un usable. Two treadmills were out of order, the lightest weights they had were 10lbs. and the only adjustable weight bench was missing the knob to adjust the bench to be used. 

On a good note the manager and staff behind the front desk was helpful when needed.",6,Robert,2024-07-14
"We had to wait 30 minutes to check in because of a computer issue, the kitchen area was missing cabinets and had exposed pipes under the sink, the carpets had rips, the bathrooms were extremely small, and the breakfast offered only the use of plastic utensils and styrofoam plates/bowls.

The hotel itself shows some signs of wear (room carpet, single wall tile, back elevator lurches) - it all seems absolutely normal. At some point it will need renovation - at this stage it's really nothing to complain about - just noting it isn't pristine, but broken in.

"Staff at check in was very helpful and the cost for the room was comparable to other sites, but the upkeep of the facility and the cleanliness was lacking.  The entrance, hallways and elevator had a very unpleasant odor, the room was in bad repair, scuffs and wear and tear through out, the showers were both dirty and the shower head in the second. Bathroom sprayed everywhere but me. The TVs throughout the suite crackled and the pixels on the TVs were damaged so the picture and sound broke up constantly. The floors were nasty. But I will say the beds were comfortable. There was a piece of paper over one of the vents in one of the bedrooms?Unfortunate because this if the first negative experience I have had at a Hyatt, but it felt like they just didn't care about the appearance or cleanliness at all.",6,Martie,2024-07-01

"We had high hopes for this hotel. The overall appearance was good but there were bugs in the bathroom and the bathroom and items from previous guests behind furniture. Also, there was only 1 trash can for the entire 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom suite so I had to move it from bathroom to bathroom. There was only 1 person working when we arrived so every time we had a question or concern, he was too busy to assist. We basically fended for ourselves. The breakfast was average. Not what I expected from a Hyatt property. It’s the same thing as a cheaper hotel which is what we will end up utilizing in the future, a cheaper hotel. Very disappointing. ",6,Lorraine,2024-06-24
"We’ve stayed here multiple times but this stay was one of our least favorite. I asked for housekeeping to come by for trash and towels but no one showed up. We had three days worth of towels and trash. The pool area wasn’t cleaned the entire stay. Bean bags beads were everywhere around the pool. The men’s bathroom next to the pool was locked all the time. The shower walls were a bit dirty. We did enjoy the free breakfast, omelet bar, and ease of parking. ",6,Melanie,2024-06-24

We were told that because we had booked through Expedia, there was nothing they could do, but refund our $10 parking fee. Yes, they charged $10 for parking on top of the cost of the room! Really a shame, the room itself was LOVELY, large kitchen, living room, door to close off the bedroom, but not being able to take a shower was a DEAL breaker for us. 12 hours on the road and a sponge bath to freshen up is NOT good.

The elevator gets stuck between 2nd and 3rd floor, elevator doors attempting to open and close (between floors). We were stuck there for 30 minutes until the Fire Department responded. They had to pry the doors open so we can crawl out. The front desk told me they never use the elevator, only the stairs. Seems like a huge safety concern to me. The room was clean, except for the sofa bed mattress (Full of urine stains) and didnt have linens for it. The pool and hot tub were closed for unknown reasons. The breakfast was good.

"Nice enough at a glance. Layout of the room was nice and spacious. Was a great plan, terrible execution. The room looked like the ""work"" was done by a trailer park landlord pinching pennies. The fake vinyl flooring was crudely put down and bubbling and peeling up. Water leak from ceiling vent by the door. The shower head situation was a complete joke. The real shower head was broken so instead of fixing it they crudely clamped on a head crappy hand wand from probably Walmart, way too low, terrible spray. The Water stinks. If you're brave enough to get in the yellow nasty water in the outdoor untreated hot tub, all I can say is God be with you. Don't use the ice cube trays and don't drink the water. Add some drama, some language barriers and some straight rudeness and I'd say just stay anywhere else. It's worth a few extra bucks. ",4,Nicholas,2024-05-27

In the early morning part of the group ahead to brave by 6am. There was no warm water to shower. I had to leave by 11 and still none. So cold showers it is.

"My husband and I believed this hotel would be a good choice while visiting friends nearby due to the Hyatt name and the location. We were very wrong. The hotel staff we spoke to were all very friendly, but otherwise this hotel had nothing else good to offer. Upon entering the room, you were hit with an old smoky musty smell. Overall, the room had not been cleaned very well. The kitchen counters had dry crusted food stuck on them, the shelving inside of the fridge was not wiped down. The appliances were very dated and the stove drawer was falling apart. The bed ""comforter"" was very thin and didn't provide much warmth.  An extra blanket was not provided as I typically see in other hotels. The bathroom vanity light stopped working after being on for less than an hour while I was trying to do my hair and makeup. The shower curtain rod was pulling out from the wall on both sides, the curtain was very stained and missing several hooks so it wouldn't stay closed. The shower head was in need of replacing. When trying to call the front desk, the phone no longer had a menu guide on it so you couldn't tell what the buttons were. We would not stay at this location again.   ",4,Aimee,2024-01-03

I’ll start off by saying the front desk man was very sweet as our room was 20 mins late after 4 pm . Next the building is very gross and unclean. There’s garbage in the hallways and they leave the hallways untouched for days. My child got sick and I had to throw a diaper out and couldn’t leave her alone in the room so I placed it outside in a bag. As the sheet reads “ place overflow of trash in the hallways “ . I received a call from the front desk gal at 10 pm waking me and my child up. Insisting the trash stinks and people have complained about the hallway smell and to take my trash to the dumpster outside immediately. When I told her about the sheet I read she got very rude so I hung up the phone and called me back on the hotel phone harassing me it’s not her job to take the trash in the hallway out.

The hotwater for th.e kitchen wouldnt work and i had to ask 2 times to have it fixed. It finally work the last night out of 5 we were there. The dishes were incomplete of a basic set. And the silverware was greasey! They advertised a bar and showed fancy plates of food as if there were a restaurant,there was no nothing.  The breakfast they served was not worth getting up for.....very...very...cheap hotel and not worth the money. Especially since the charge for parking!!!

My perception was change however that evening by Steven, he was so helpful, kind, and his customer service was impeccable. He took to time to chat and connect with us.

"I’ll start with the good that’s the staff and the washing machines. The area is also nice. Very convenient off the freeway. And lots of things nearby for convenience. But the property itself is very worn down. Restrooms at the pool were disgusting and not cleaned. After booking, I was alerted via email that the Spa was closed. I called and asked about the pool and they said it was open and heated. Just a spot itself was not working. Well, the pool was murky, cloudy and definitely not heated as it was ice cold on an 83 degree beautiful day. The whole week we were there was beautiful and sunny, but we could not use the pool even once, I would have stayed elsewhere if they had been up front about this. This was supposed to be a relaxing vacation, with some pool time…. So while the pool “area” was open for use all you could really do is sit out there at the tables and chairs. The area with the more comfortable seating/ cabana area with fire pit is nothing like in the pictures. It is worn down old and the fire pit does not work at all according to the staff. Lighting also broken and just worn down. When I asked for housekeeping, all they did was vacuum they did not make the beds or bring fresh towels despite my towels being left on the floor and taken away, I had to call for more towels to be replenished and waited over an hour before just showering and air drying because they didn’t knock and just left the towels on the floor outside. Overall disappointing for a Hyatt.

The hotel was old and outdated. While walking through the halls of the hotel it smelled significantly. When i got to my room the carpet was ripped up in the living room and never replaced. The bathrooms had mold in them. The showers weren't properly cleaned and the doors were dirty and looked like they haven't been cleaned or wiped down in months. There was spider webs and dirty vent covers that also looked like they haven't been cleaned in a while. Asking someone to pay for a room infested with mold is insane. This property is not well maintained in the room i stayed in. I will not be staying here again. Mold in a hotel is completely unacceptable. ,2,Christen,2023-09-24

The last hotel we stayed out the night before the front desk and other employees were snooty but this guy was so nice.  The room was clean and updated.  It was awesome.  I wish there pool and jacuzzi was indoors but eveything else was awesome.  The pool area was clean.  There free breakfast was amazing.  The price if the room was an awesome price.

"I strategically chose this hotel after hours of searching for a nice place with a nice breakfast, a pool and a hot tub. After 12 hours of traveling, our only plan after checking in was to relax for the evening by the pool and in the hot tub. Upon arrival, after checking in, we headed for our room and realized there was no water in the pool and the hot tub was dirty, half full of water and clearly out of order. The ride guy at the front desk hesitantly told me it was broken for 3 weeks. I was highly disappointed. They wouldn't do anything for me for this major inconvenience and when I asked him why they didn't notify us in advance, his simple response was ""we don't do that."" The whole conversation was full of dead ends and the company doing absolutely nothing to rectify the issue. We ended up on the phone with Expedia for an hour and they were able to get us another hotel. I would not give this company my money. It was a terrible experience. ",2,Jamie,2023-08-13

"This property could stand to replace the mattress and pillows. The pillows were so flat that my husband and I went to Target to purchase pillows. The mattress was no better, just not practical to purchase a new mattress unfortunately. Sheets were pungent with chemicals and a hue of yellow from being washed so many times over the years. Fabric was maybe 200 thread count. Made me consider packing a king sheet set next time I travel. It really put a damper on the whole trip since I was dead tired all three days from lack of sleep. I get it, high altitude also makes it hard to stay asleep but those beds were making it straight up impossible to sleep due to discomfort. I had booked third party and had my hands tied to move hotels. Otherwise the hotel room was great, had everything we needed. ",8,Brittany,2023-08-10

Booked this property due to the cost but that doesn’t offset the overall condition of the property.  The pool and hot tub were broken which was a huge disappointment for my kids. It was nice to have a kitchen in the room but it was pretty beat up. The fridge’s freeze leaked into the fridge. The flooring strip at the door ripped up when we came in and there were no pillows or blankets for the fold out bed.  In the bathroom the toilet wasn’t fully secured to the floor. The location was convenient to food and activities.  Overall I’d avoid this property unless cost is the most important thing.,4,Charles,2023-08-06
The property didn't feel like the same one I saw online.  The lobby had a dreary fluorescent lighting kind of look.  Elevators weren't super clean.  Cabinets in bathroom were banged up.  That night either a car alarm or mechanical sound went on/off on a repeated cycle in the middle of the night for a few hours.  The light switches in the entry didn't turn on any lights and other bulbs were burned out in the room.  Overall this was a C- experience.,6,Laryn,2023-08-06

"I checked into Hyatt House DTC on 7/13/23 for a 4-night stay for 2 guests.
My reservation was for a one bedroom king suite; however, I was given a one bedroom queen suite. Concerned I might be overpaying for the room I was given, I brought this up to the staff. In return, I was told that they were overbooked and I was placed in a more expensive room instead. (A room with a smaller bed is more expensive? Not believable to me.)
Upon walking into the hotel, I could immediately tell that the lobby's AC was out. It stayed that way throughout our stay. 
While our room was cool, it was not in the best condition. The walls and furniture were scratched and scuffed. The refrigerator door was dented. The sectional couch was stained. The closet wall had a hole through it. The bed frame was bent — when one would lay on the bed, the frame would give way and force the mattress to lean toward the floor. 
The walls of this hotel were very thin. Our room was on the first floor, and butted up to the courtyard/pool area. The hotel did not seem to have a curfew for these areas, as boisterous noises from other guests could be heard coming from this area throughout each night. Guests above and next to us could easily be heard walking around and conversing.
The pool appeared filthy. The water was green and cloudy throughout our stay. Neither my guest nor I felt comfortable swimming.
Despite these inconveniences, I'd like to note that the linens were clean, and access to downtown Denver was great. ",6,Josh,2023-07-19

When we got to the court yard you could tell the water was green. You could see bugs floating in it and there was alge or some green slime on the steps and the floor of the pool. Super gross :( I did address the hotel front desk and he was shocked that the pool was gross but nothing was done about it.

"Hyatt Place at Denver Tech is run-down, old, and poorly cared for inside. When we arrived, we were told that there was cleaning service only on the fourth day of the stay— and it certainly shows. Our room had old, dirty furniture with stains, a bedspread with black fingerprints on it, doorframes with (I kid you not) buggers wiped on it, a moldy ceiling in the bathroom, and a shower with white calcium buildup on the floors, a poorly caulked grout, and a door that wouldn’t seal shut. Additionally, they capped off the A/C at 68 degrees, and the room could get uncomfortably warm. There was even a giant trash bin on the inside of the lobby with tons of bagged, smelly, visible garbage. The one positive is that the two concierges were both kind and informative. Please— update your furniture and provide more thorough and careful cleaning to each of your rooms. Lastly, pay attention to the little details: they matter greatly!",4,Emily,2023-06-05
"This is a very dirty and rude staff, outdated everything was broken…A/C leaking water in room, pool broken, dirty bedding, couldn’t shower water was scalding hot. VERY DISAPPOINTING HOTEL..",2,Kimberly,2023-06-03
"When we first got there, and they gave us a room that shower was full of mold, and the carpet in the living area was shredded and dirty dirty they gave us a different room. The shower still had some mold, and the carpets was very dirty you had to wear shoes in the room and also flip-flops in the shower. Also someone had spilled eggs in the hallway right in front of our door and it took two days for them to clean it up. And when I checked out, I asked them to email me my receipt. I had to call them two days later because I still have not received my receipt and then they sent me one. I was very disappointed in the rules I know Hyatt has a higher standard, but you didn’t see it in that Hyatt.",4,Diana,2023-06-02

"While the concept is nice, it’s a full square of rooms with a courtyard in the middle. However the elevator is only in one location meaning a lot of walking! The second elevator is only a service elevator? The suite did not have any bedding for the sofa in the room.? The air conditioner is like an airplane engine. The breakfast room had mainly uncomfortable high tops - and finally no pool or hot tub operating. The re fillable bottles in shower were empty:-( just generally lack of care here to what could be a nice hotel (that does need more elevators). ",6,Antonia,2023-05-28

"Extremely Disappointing 
Not sure where the good reviews came from but this hotel is not worth staying at. Very outdated and beat up rooms, dirty rooms and public areas. Crowded, terrible breakfast; strong of pot smell in lobby/entry area/hallways. Very surprised Hyatt puts their name on this hotel. Stay anywhere but here if you want a good night sleep. We only chose this because the Hyatt Park Meadows is under construction. Would not do that again.",2,Kirsten,2023-05-16

Wasnt happy went to walk dogs and tge dog area and trash can atea full of rats running around everywhere and up in our cars too i couldnt believe what i was seeing at a nice hotel. Than a week later when we already told the front desk person day of check in we would be staying a few months and he said that was fine and we could stay in same room and just book online and we will be good. But no they had us completely check out and wanted us to move to a different room wow really we both was heading to work had to call off lost a lot of money that day not cool at all very inconvenient and wrong. We loaded r 2 cars down and went to a different hotel so much better treatment with respect their. This is a horrible place cause instead of listening to u cause u got upset about have to moved to a different room which is so inconvenient and no other hotel has done this to me they allowed me to stay in same room and pay again without calling cops to cause upset about having to move last min when we had work we were fixing to walk out to wrongful treatment in so many area need fixing this shouldnt happen to anyone!!!,2,Connie,2023-04-21

This property is in desperate need of an update. The staff said they were in line with Hyatt for the update but didn’t know when. The carpets were dirty and the showers were caked with grime in the corners. The dresser drawers would not stay shut. This was the same situation at the other Hyatt near by that’s why this time we chose the Hyatt House. The breakfast was amazing. ,8,Karen,2023-04-18

I loved the service and location.  ,10,DrDayatrice,2023-03-21
"First, the positive. The room I ended up in was clean & all 3 of the rooms I visited were exactly as advertised. (There were a couple of maintenance & housekeeping issues with the first two). The only people I interacted with were the front desk staff & manager. They were all very nice & friendly. 
Where this property is shooting itself in the foot is the ""amenities"". One of the reasons I chose this hotel was for the convenience of on-site dining. The Hyatt website claims to have a restaurant & bar - they have neither.  When I questioned why they were advertising that they did, the front desk man told me they were having ""staffing issues"". Yet when I went back and looked through the other reviews, it seems they shut the restaurant down some time ago. 
I packed a bathing suit so I could relax in the hot tub after the long days I expected. I could have saved the space in my bag because it has apparently been out of service & ""waiting on parts"" for a very long time. Years, if the other reviews are to be believed. 
Then there is the absurd parking fee. I admit that if I had read through all of the fine print I would have known there was a parking fee, but in that area, $7 per night to park in an unsecured lot without security is absurd - especially when you consider that comparable properties in the same area offer free self-parking. 
The missing amenities are the reason that when I booked this week, I decided to pay the same rate to return to Hilton.

"I loved that my kids could take our dog out and I had the piece of mind knowing they were safe in the courtyard.  We travel a lot, and my hubby and I always have to take the dog out for safety.  You guys have that great courtyard and poop bags all around incase someone forgets theirs.  It was great to let the kids take our dog out so we could sleep in for once!

I think you need more 2 bedroom suites with 2 beds in the 2nd room.  We LOVED everything about this hotel, but my kiddos hated sharing a bed and I wanted to enjoy a clutter free living room.",10,ANGELA,2023-03-18

"This is my 2nd attempt to leave a review. The shower in my room was filthy with mildew & mold. I told the staff & they said they’d have it cleaned. It looked no different but I HAD to take a shower & was grossed out the entire time. Then the strip around the door fell off! I tried to stop it with my foot but my ankle was bruised. I asked for another room but the showers weren’t any better. I can smell the mildew, so asked for it to be cleaned 3 times. I realized that it needed to be inspected for mold, then cleaned & recalked. No one said anything other than is there anything else we can do - so I asked to be moved to another, better room - but the shower was just as bad. I’m in town for trauma therapy & honestly, not being able to take a shower & being injured when I did isn’t helping. I need to figure out how to get a refund so I can afford to book another room for next week. I thought Hyatt’s were nice / the ratings were good but I don’t get how that’s possible. The staff here is king & they must not be empowered to make the changes to make the shower safe. Thx Leslie Arnold (719) 232-7782",2,Leslie,2023-02-17

"The property was very dirty and not well kept. The building was outdated. In our room the carpet was peeling up. There was dust everywhere and gum under the bedside tables. There was hair still in the shower. We asked to change rooms but when in line with the front desk in the morning other people where also complaining about their rooms, so we decided none of the rooms were cleaned. The breakfast however, was really good. ",2,Kylie,2023-02-06
"Hyattと言っていいのか⁈と思うほど、施設が汚く、最初に案内された部屋は悪臭が有り、施設もボロボロでした。

"There was mold in the vent of our bathroom. Half of the stuff was not properly cleaned before we walked in. Everything was dinged up, the lamp shade by the bed was broken. The paper towel descender was also broken. I found a dead bug smooshed in the frame of a picture. The breakfast was never good. The staff told us they would clean our room Sunday but did it Saturday instead. The list could go on, we thought this would be a higher quality hotel but we were very wrong.
