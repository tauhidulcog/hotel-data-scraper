"My husband and I stayed here for one night while visiting family in the area.  The hotel was comfortable and clean, and the service was warm and friendly.  The room had everything we needed and good toiletries.  The bed was decent, and the breakfast was great.  I wish they had 'real' half and half instead of the small containers that have a funny after taste.  Also, if you like to work out when you travel, the gym is subpar.  They had a a treadmill, eliptical and Peleton. The treadmill wasn't working, and I couldn't figure out why the TVs on the elliptical and wall weren't working. 

After we checked out, I realized that I left the pillow in my room. I went back an hour later, and housekeeping went to get it and brought it back to me.  Very friendly staff.  I would stay here again for a short stay, but I would look for a hotel with a well equipped gym for a longer stay.  ",8,Shannon,2025-07-05

"Good buffet breakfast, something for everyone; if you stay for more than two days your room will only be serviced every other day unless you ask for everyday service. Our room was very close to the secondary entrance to the parking lot, but they barricade that entrance mid afternoon which was disappointing. Staff is friendly and helpful.",8,Gregory,2025-06-09
"The first night we stayed in a room by the 24 hr laundry. The walls are paper thin. We heard the washer and dryer all night, even after we turned on the fan and a white noise app. We were moved to another room the second day, but the toilet handle was broken, the ac rattled, and the thermostat didn't work. One reception worker, Linda, was excellent. One was rude. I expect more from Hilton properties.",4,Robert,2025-06-09

This is a nice property and quiet. The only hitch is the occupants above us had an uncontrollable child running around all morning and night and we couldn't have a peaceful sleep. The staff were great people and it's a place i'd recommend. We were there with our children and it was peaceful. Thank you.,8,KOFI,2025-01-01

"Larger property, floor plan can be confusing at first.  This is mostly business people... good for meetings.  Excellent breakfast buffet with locally cooked dishes (carnitas, tortillas, etc) Manager told me the entire property will undergo re-furb in 2025. ",10,George,2024-12-29
Breakfast buffet was excellent. Rooms are not very well sound-proofed - you can hear people talking in adjacent rooms and people dragging chairs on the floor. Darker curtains would be nice to block out light. Really annoying is a bright night light that cannot be turned off. I like to sleep in a totally dark room and had to find a way to block the light. Maid service was superficial - the shower conditioner bottle was broken and never got fixed or replaced. They should check everything rather than wait for guests to report problems.,6,Jeffrey,2024-12-27

We were in town for a family wedding and this spot was perfect for us. The room was very spacious with a full kitchen. I made use of the iron and ironing board that was provided!! Breakfast was good with many options. The staff was very pleasant. Thanks for a wonderful stay at a great price!,10,Susan,2024-11-17

"The service from the staff was great - very friendly, professional and efficient. I requested extra bedding around 2 am, and it was delivered within minutes. 

The breakfast area was outstanding: good variety of options, clean and organized with delicious food. 

My only 3 negatives from this trip: 
1) The mattress was so hard an uncomfortable on the king bed that I attempted to sleep on the fold-out sleeper-sofa, which also failed. 
2) The sleeper sofa (including the ""mattress"" within) looks and feels like it's from the 1970s. Definitely NOT the quality I expect from Hilton. 
3) The toilet is low enough to be ""toddler height"", which is extremely difficult to maneuver oneself as a tall adult. 

Overall, a good experience, and I anticipate staying here again in the future. ",8,Christina,2024-11-11

"My husband and I stayed at this property for a week. While the rooms were a bit dated, everything was very clean and in working order. I would only suggest better lighting, especially the area where the full mirror is. Also, a better water pressure in the shower would be great. We enjoyed the area and how close we were to restaurants and shopping and we were only 5 minutes to the apartments where are son moved in to. The staff was pleasant each time we encountered them. The pool, hot tub and basketball court was a very nice. This hotel allows pets and although we saw guests walking their dogs, we never heard one inside the hotel.   Overall, very clean and nice hotel. ",10,Carron,2024-10-17
"Relatively new location and not ‘broken in’ like some hotels turn out to be, as of 10/6/24 Extremely clean and nice inside. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Easy check in and the breakfast is well above average. Good quiet location tucked away in a patch of woods and easy access to the highway with plenty of dining options. Great value for the price paid. ",10,Anthony,2024-10-07
All rooms are pet friendly so the room smelled like dog. The only solution was a can of lysol spray. Unfortunately it caused my allergies to flare up. ,2,Rosie,2024-09-09

Horrible service.  Horrible.  I booked two queen beds and they said they didnt have available and tried charging me more when  I checked in.  My nine year old had to sleep on a sofa because the sofa bed wasn't made.  Don't stay here.,2,Justin,2023-04-03
