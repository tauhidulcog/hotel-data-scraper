"Aloft was just what we needed. A safe hotel for $140 between Denver and Boulder with FREE parking and affordable , clean and nice.  
We’ll be back.   Thanks !",10,Chad,2025-10-06
"Stayed 4 nights, on check out day the cleaning crew knocked on the door at 8:45 AM, we told her we would be a while.  Knocked on door again at 10:30 and I confirmed that check out time was NOON and we’d be leaving at NOON then.  No change available for washer/dryer and very expensive.",8,Donald Edward,2025-10-04
My reservation that was booked 2 months in advance was cancelled by the hotel 51 mins before the check in time. I will never book at this hotel again. ,2,Stephanie,2025-09-30
"Property was amazing.  I did get an email that my room was sold, but when I got there they had a room for me.  So I am a little confused by that.  The staff was so wonderful and allowed me to have a little later check out.  Would highly recommend. ",10,Carrie,2025-09-29
"Nice place with easy pub transit to Denver, Arvada and Boulder",10,david,2025-09-26
We started late the first day so all we asked for were towels. Yesterday no one ever came we had to tell front desk to ask them to bring them to our room. I was not happy with that at all. ,8,Susan,2025-09-22

"Booked online after having a flight delays, next flight canceled, baggage missing and will be arriving late to my scheduled event - whole purpose for traveling - just to arrive to the hotel to be told they’re at 100% capacity. Not sure why I was allowed to book if there was no availability. Horrible experience.",2,Tierra,2025-09-17

I used the fitness room. We ordered hot breakfast. Service was quick and accurate. ",10,Stephen,2025-09-06
"Enjoyed my brief stay! I like that there is a coffee shop walking distance and plenty of parking.
Rooms were clean and spacious.

It was cool to see Dry Bar branded products in the hotel as well as they are good quality. ",8,Marianne,2025-09-05

"The hotel was fine overall. Would have liked a complimentary breakfast, but the stay was fine.
Whoever designed the shower needs a new job. There is no seal or anything to divert the water around the shower door so the floor is always covered in water, and if you are not careful, it can be a lot of water. ",10,Ronny,2025-08-20
"The check in was so confusing and terrible. The hosts do not know anything about hospitality of welcoming a customer. Second, the bathroom had a leak under the sink, so water leaked all night running my sleep. Next the the whole floor was wet. Breakfast was included but frankly it was not pleasant at all",6,Juan,2025-08-18
,10,Arturo,2025-08-18
Nothing was clean in our room and everyrhing was outdated. The food was awful and it was unbearable to sleep at night thanks to the room being so hot due to the AC barely working. Awful stay will not return,2,Merryanne,2025-08-17

Wasn’t the room we thought we booked and they did not have what we wanted. Shower water flooded the floor with every shower. Sink clogged. Had to flush the toilet twice each time. Stained sheets. No ice makers in the hotel. No internet except for the lobby. Last morning of our stay the ceiling fell through outside our door. Took the staff 2 hours to respond. Water leaking from ceiling. Floor soaked. We would like a full refund. Terribly uncomfortable stay. ,2,Bree,2025-07-06

"I typically like this hotel, but the internet was down for my entire stay.  This hindered me in my daily work routines, I had to make other arrangements just so I can email clients, and complete the purpose for my visit.
It would have changed my bookings if I was told up front that the internet was down and no one had an idea as to when the system would be back up and running.  The internet in the lobby was useless as everyone in the hotel was using this service.

The carpet was wrinkled down the center of the hallway.  I was not paying attention and these creases caused me to trip.

Not impressed at all",4,Thomas,2025-06-30
Didn’t like the fact there was no Wi-Fi the entire time I stayed.,6,Lashun,2025-06-30
The property itself was safe and clean but the room that I was put in was definitely not the room I was shown on Expedia I was expecting a room that had a living room and a bedroom but nope it was a just a single King size room and it shows something completely different on Expedia so I was very upset and felt like I way overpaid I feel this should be refunded because it's false advertising ,2,Elisha,2025-06-30

"While the property looks nice aesthetically, the inside and run of the onsite registration staff cannot accommodate fully.  My room was not exactly as described and therefore not worth the lodging cost.  We probably won't return.  No hot running water, no microwave, room key card not working.  Not worth it if you are tired from a long driving trip.",4,Natalie,2025-06-12
,10,Diana,2025-06-10
The WiFi has been out for a week prior to our arrival.  We did get a notification about it but thinking it would be fixed sooner rather than later.  No.  There’s not even good cell service. You have to get against your room window.  The lobby has a locked WiFi that you only get if you ask for it.  ,6,Genette,2025-06-07

"This place is too modern for my taste.  The room had no drawers but, cubbies that didn’t fit everything.  The closet space is minimal.  The WIFI if not on there specific one is shot.  If you’re doing business on your private VPN or hotspot, it will not pull up at all.  A lot of frustrated business professionals were in the lobby trying to get some work done but, to no avail.  I would definitely not do an ALOFT again.",4,Eleilani,2025-05-14

"I've always had good experiences at Aloft, but this stay was a bit disappointing. We had planned and prepped for a celebration swim, only to find out the pool was out of order. That really put a damper on our engagement plans and killed part of the vibe we were hoping for.

To make things more frustrating, I originally considered staying at Aloft Westminster but was told over the phone that they required a $250 cash deposit instead of a credit card hold, which seemed excessive. So, I opted for Broomfield/Boulder instead.

We still had an amazing night out, and the hotel itself was fine, but not being able to enjoy the amenities we planned for really impacted the experience.",6,Devin,2025-03-30

Enjoyed my one night stay. AC is a little loud/room temp hard to regulate and sat at the bar for about 20 minutes before anyone served me which is why I gave 4/5.

"My stay at Aloft Hotels was a mixed experience. While the room itself was fairly clean and modern, I was disappointed to find stained bedsheets upon arrival. The stains—possibly coffee or worse—made me feel uncomfortable and concerned about the overall attention to cleanliness.

The rest of the room seemed to be in good condition, and the design was sleek and inviting, but encountering an issue like this immediately dampened my impression. Clean, fresh linens are a basic expectation for any hotel, and this oversight left me hesitant about recommending or revisiting this location.",8,Devin,2024-12-16

Lobby is sterile and unwelcoming. Staff is uninformed and uncaring. Breakfast foods are terrible. Even the coffee is bad. Carpet in hallways has huge wrinkles.  Streaming on TV didn’t work. The room was comfortable and clean though.,6,Mark,2024-11-13
"While this is the new fashion, it's uncomfortable. No sitting in rooms but a hard wooden bench. The shower contained 1/2 the water, the rest ended up on the bathroom floor. No exhaust fan so entire room fairly dripped with condensation. There were a couple nice desk clerks but the majority were SNOBS. The beds are for young people (under 30) of you are 40 and over seek Drury. No complimentary ANYTHING. My guess even toilet paper is called incidental. Can't watch free TV with anything. Decently clean, air conditioner and heat worked. They were slow to amend snow and ice slippage in parking lot. Over all not worth it to us. The Drury is 1000 times better. Worth the extra price to go there. We'll not be staying Aloft again. We ended up sitting in our car to watch on our phones with crappy signal no wifi in parking lot. By the time we left we needed chiropractic care from beds and lack of in room sitting and entertainment without pay. We bought our own toilet paper, tissue and soaps. I better not have one teenyb tiny ""incidental"" on my cats or there will be he** to pay. ",4,Lisa,2024-11-12

"The room was dirty, someone left a used sanitary pad on the floor, the carpets were dirty, the bedding was dirty, the bathrooms were dirty. There's no excuse for the condition of the room. It's disgusting to find used  sanitary products in your room discarded on the floor. And for being pet friendly and charging you for a pet it wasn't pet friendly at all.

"The people who worked the front desk where very nice and helpful ( I have never stayed at a hotel with no ice machine for the guest)
When we arrived to the room, which appeared clean, our refrigerator didn’t work - it was replaced our safe didn’t work either, replacement would entail changing rooms.  The temp of room wouldn’t stay cool, in other words to get it cool the room heated up to uncomfortable temperatures and then the AC would kick on.  I only tripped on the extremely wrinkled carpet once!! This carpet was in the hallways.  All they need is for a company to come out and fix it. ",6,Jane,2024-10-13

The windows don't open so there is no option for outside air.  The carpet in the hallways of all floors is ""loose"" similar to a rug that is folder over. extreme trip hazard.  Significant large scale, long term construction in the area also, there was an active shooting right next door one moring. ",4,Nicholas,2024-09-19

"Aloft was an overall decent experience. AC in the rooms isn’t really sufficient during the 95 degree days, but it cools down enough at night to be comfortable. The carpets in the hallways were wrinkled and puckered - worried that it is a trip hazard. Aesthetic is clean if a little sterile. Staff is terrific. Lobby is spacious and quiet. :) My teenagers loved the billiards table. Beds were SUPER COMFY. Showers were hot with good water pressure. Easy access to highway. Arista sandwich shop down the street has the best breakfast burritos ever. Would stay here again. ",8,Carla,2024-08-24

We still had about 2hrs and a half to check out and we went to get some coffee. Came back and lady was already cleaning.  I said (in spanish) we were not done with room so she left. Acouple minutes later they (i believe were other cleaning ladies in the same hallway) tried opening the door twice. Thankfully we had that second latch on door so it didnt open all the way. I was not happy with them invading my privacy. I spoke to girl at the front desk as i checked out and she said her manager would reach out later. They never did reach out.

After getting to our room I attempted to use the elevator to get to the first floor and it was not working. No big deal, I used the stairs and brought the issue up to the front desk. The gentlemen talked to me like I was a moron and made me feel like I was pushing the wrong button.

"Place is trendy-looking but is nothing but a big depressive building.  The front desk staff didnt smile and it seemed she didn't want to be there. And I dont blame her! 
There was no decent alcohol at the ""bar"" (cant even call it a bar!) 2 choices of beer, no name brand liquor, no tomato juice, not even a freakin lime! No food, no kitchen. Bartender was sweet but he was uber embarrassed that he could accommodate me in any way. He said new management cane in and took away all the good things like liquor, food, kareoke. The website says there is awesome nights at the bar, and its all a lie. 

Dont even get me started on how filthy the floors are. I had on white socks and after a few steps around my room, they were pitch black! I had to throw them away. 
Bathroom is poorly lit, making me assume that was filthy as well.

"My windows were facing the apartments across the street, so if i wanted to have my curtains open I had zero privacy once leaving the bathroom unless I was sitting under the TV facing the bed with the windows on either side of me behind me. The window to the left of the TV faced directly into the fogged window of the shower, which certainly would have silhouetted if I had chosen to shower at night. Check in was confusing, my payment was charged twice and they were not able to give me a reason as to why, and then after it being returned to my account during my stay I had to pay for my stay at check out which was very confusing. Also, no one checked or asked for my ID when I ""checked in."" The road noise is VERY loud for such a quiet neighborhood and you can hear quite well any time someone in a room near you moves their blinds open or closed. I will not be returning, and I will be telling my friends and family not to come here.",2,Miranda,2024-04-11

Would definitely return. Had a wonderful stay!,10,Mason,2023-05-16
"I wanted to like it - a cool, modernized Marriott, yes! 
Id hope to make this my regular place when in CO working or seeking family. 
But, it was a huge disappointment and I will not return. 
Upon arrival, we were given keys and told nothing, like where the elevators are, our room number, what time is breakfast, not a word. She was pleasant but said nothing after asking for my cc. The hallway on 2 needed to be vacuumed. Carpet was also warpedby elevator. No biggie to me but while we are giving a full review...There was no hot water for shower or sink. When I called about this, the response was not great. Told to run water for another 15 or so mins. One of us got a hot shower. One did not. No warm water to wash face in sink. Breakfast - we paid for the breakfast for 2.  After 3-4 unanswered calls the day before, we finally reached the desk and were told ""the breakfast chef is out"" - theres no breakfast. I left my key at the desk and the girl there said absolutely nothing. No thank you, have a nice day, hope you enjoyed your stay, peace out...nothing but a blank stare. It was weird. I hope this place gets it together. It has potential. ",4,Juliet,2023-05-16

Great service room was very well taken care of no complaints anywhere,10,Verified traveler,2023-05-15
"Greeter for check in and was not friendly. No hot water, called front desk the man said it hadn’t been working properly for a few days. So why continue to check people in when the hot water doesn’t work. Would NOT recommend! 0 stars for no hot water for showers! ",6,Benjamin,2023-05-14

The place was perfect for why we were there. Super convenient to walk to our event. Only complaint I had was that we had to go all the way down to the front desk to ask them to fill our ice bucket. And the fact our room smelled like Colorado skunk weed. 🍁 ,10,Kelsey,2023-05-01
"It was really nice, honestly. Better than I had expected, for sure. We had a great stay, the rooms were quite clean and spacious, and the housekeepers were great. My one and only complaint (if you could even call it that) was that on the second day we were there, my pillowcase was switched out with a more worn one and the ""pills"" on the case irritated my face. I just switched it out with the one underneath it and all was good, though, so I don't really even consider it a complaint. ",10,Kiersten,2023-04-24

"The Pool was not working the entire stay. We booked with this hotel for the indoor pool. We arrived on a Sunday, and it was down, they said it was getting fixed the next day. It did not get fixed, and no reasoning was given. ",4,Cody W,2023-03-27
No microwave. Small fridge. Are you catering to a demo thats only here for a day or 2?,6,Shawn,2023-03-26
Provide free breakfast and get rid of the candy for sale in the morning! Some people need food before they check out,6,Ashley,2023-03-24
"I liked how clean my room was, how friendly the was during my checkin process, and the laundry facilities that were available. The only thing i didn't like was that there weren't alot of dining facilities close by. Overall excellent place to stay and worth another stay in the future!!",10,Felicia,2023-03-23

"I have enjoyed my stay here. I like the music 🎶 in the elevators the seating areas throughout with a pool table & board game options for the non drinkers. Also, this hotel has Women employees which I appreciate. ",10,January,2023-02-23
"It was a clean room but the elevator and Lobby looked a bit trashed. People up after 3am partying and slamming doors, made it hard to sleep.",4,justin,2023-02-14
Everything eas good and clean except i reserved a King bed with a mobility tub. But this particular appropriate doesn't even have mobility tubs for the bathroom. I paid for A mobility room and got a regular room. The hotel is really nice and clean. Therl breakfast had a few items missing and there food shop didn't have milk for the cereal. But over all This is a Really cool motel! ,8,Maria,2023-01-28
