Hotel was nice and convenient location but my room was adjacent to freeway and it was very loud. My colleague had similar experience. Third colleague said his room was on the interior of the hotel and was quiet. ,6,Ryan,2025-10-06

I chose this hotel due to its close walking distance to the SAP center and it did not disappoint. Nice 5-6 minute walk felt safe as many other guests were also walking. Room was clean and comfortable. The showers are fantastic!  Will definitely stay again. ,8,Curtis,2025-09-29

Everything was great! Only hiccup was no hot water in the morning. The staff was great at communicating while they worked to complete repairs. This is something that I’m sure happens any where.m at any time. So nothing against the hotel itself. ,8,Alexander,2025-08-12

The hotel was very clean staff very nice. Did not like the parking situation a total of $34 per day to park in the parking lot that is not attached to the hotel that was a big inconvenience plus you had to park on the third fourth and fifth level could not park on the other levels.

"Unfortunately my exeperinece with the management has overshadowed the actual hotel itself.  The front desk was helpful during our stay and even let us keep our bags with them after check out for a couple hours so we didnt have to leave our luggage in the car.  HOWEVER, we were automatically charged for in and out parking which we did not use.  We left the car in the garage and paid the fee at kiosk.  I called several times to dispute it and they said they would refund it after not even appoligizing for such inconvenience.  Still havent received the refund and the manger seemed to just want to tell me why they charged me for a sevice I didnt use.  Butbwhy would I lay for parking twice. This seems very crooked to me and that they were hoping I wouldnt notice charge. Because of this, I wouldnt stay there again eventhough I did enjoy the stay and other staff.  This is just too sneaky to me and such a waste of time to be calling to get my money back. ",4,Janine,2025-05-04
"This is nice if you are looking for BASIC amenities. All their ""suites"" and I use that term loosely( they are not even 1 bedrooms like they advertise- 1 small room)- are over the FREEWAY. I heard every single car. the room was bare and cold. I honestly felt like I was in a jail cell. I am sorry to be so blunt. ",6,Kristen,2025-04-30

Nice hotel. The only staff we saw was 1 lady checking in. It was pretty much a ghost town. No one for valet and had to self park which is ok but how the parking lot is set up it's really hard to get your luggage to your car when checking out. The garage offers only stairs and it would be nice if there was an elevator to help get your luggage to the 3rd floor or a parking area on the outside to load your car back up. The beds were uncomfortable and the room was hot. We couldn't get the ac to work. I don't know if they put us in a room that wasn't great because I booked the room through Expedia and not direct. ,8,michele,2025-02-18

"This was our first time to the property. We came for a hockey game. We loved how close it was to the stadium. We had a room that was very large and had every amenity that we needed. The only drawback is that they don’t do valet parking because they have a separate parking structure that is privately owned next to it. So we had to bring all our luggage across the parking structure to the hotel, which was a bit of a pain.
We also brought our dog which was allowed and we were grateful for that - it was $50 extra. 
We will return to this hotel next year due to the location, the room, and staff.

Liked cleanliness and water stations to fill up water bottles. Didn’t like the bed. Too hard. Not happy with inconsistent information from front desk staff regarding paying for parking. I was charged for it before leaving even though I had been told to pay when leaving the garage. I had to ask about it when checking out. I also didn’t like that I was charged for my stay before I even got there when I was supposed to pay upon arrival. And why was I charged more than Expedia said it would cost?,8,Rhonda,2025-02-06

"All generally good except our 2 queen bed room had 2 glasses and 1 paper coffee cup........ Really! We had 3 people for the stay. It was New Year's Eve and we had really counted on have the hotel lounge open as stated, until 10:00 PM, so we could grab a decent bite of food and a cocktail after the 5:00 PM Sharks game. Closed because of some internet issue, or something? We really didn't want to drive anywhere or fight the Uber/Lyft scene on NYE.",6,Donald,2025-01-01

"If you actually would like a room at this hotel, don’t book here. They have a habit of overbooking, then telling guests upon arrival that they don’t have a room for them. It happened to me when I arrived for my stay on December 10, and it happened to a friend of mine a couple of weeks prior. The front desk people were incredibly rude as well. They curtly informed me that it was Expedia’s job to rebook me then just kind of stared at me. No apology, no offer to call around for alternate hotels, no asking if I wanted water or something while I tried to figure out my next move. I had to spend two hours on the phone with Expedia to find another room when I could have been enjoying time with my family (which was the point of the trip). Meanwhile, people who booked directly with the property were able to waltz up and check right in. Hey Marriott, if you don’t intend to give rooms to people who book 3rd party, don’t make contracts with 3rd party companies. It’s a big hassle for all of us and I’m pretty sure, in my state at least, it’s illegal. ",2,Kate,2024-12-14

The front desk Check in person was awful. They were answering the phone instead of helping the line of people waiting to check in. Then once I finally went to check in the lady didn’t even ask any questions and didn’t see my reservation and charged me for a room I already paid for. I was also charged twice by their parking garage as well and had to call back to get refunded for both. Great location if you’re going to a concert but not great customer service. ,4,Riley,2024-07-28

We reserved a King room and got a Queen room. I did not buy breakfast but it was included anyway. No one told us that until we checked out and our ride was waiting. That was disappointing.

" The check in was quick and easy. The lady who checked us in was very friendly and was more than willing to answer any of our questions. She explained the parking and the serving of breakfast and dinner if we are interested in eating there at the hotel. 

The room was very clean and fresh. There was a small fridge in the room which contained 2 small bottles of water along with 2 glasses. However, if you are bringing things into your room that need to be placed in the fridge you may have some problems since the fridge is quite small. Also, when using the hand held shower head the rain head shower head did not seal and it would leak cold water on you while showering. 

Other than those minor details the stay was excellent and I would definitely consider staying there in the future.",10,J Keith,2024-03-01

"Despite traveling with two kids, the place isn't really family-friendly. The bathroom door did not have a lock, which surprised us. As a result, our kids kept going in and out. Dirt was visible under our children's feet because the floors weren't clean. Service at the bar was slow. Breakfast buffet was a bit confusing. Staff at the reception desk were great, but overall, the hotel isn't kid-friendly. The price we paid was not worth it.",2,Rabel,2023-03-26

"Very close to the hockey arena and places to eat. Easy walking to downtown.
Nice park and river path close by. Unfortunately, homeless make their camps in this same area. Never felt unsafe, just sad.
The hotel is very close to the freeway overpass, but our room and the whole inside of the hotel was very quiet. 
Had a delicious omelette for breakfast.
Enjoyed our stay very much.",8,Kate,2023-03-21

I didn’t like that I wasn’t informed at check in that breakfast was not complimentary. I was only informed of when it was served ,10,karen,2023-03-19

Great location. Short safe walk to the SAP Center. Only Me and my daughters and felt safe walking around. Close to many nice restaurants. Only down side was the parking fee. Very expensive $35,8,Jessica,2023-03-13

"Paid $345 for a room with a view,  of the freeway and off ramp. Filthiest windows ever plus two bullet holes. Very limited breakfast item's and wanting $20 extra for it. Double charged for parking, not even a microwave in the room. Motel 6 gives you more for your money.",4,Richard A,2023-02-23
