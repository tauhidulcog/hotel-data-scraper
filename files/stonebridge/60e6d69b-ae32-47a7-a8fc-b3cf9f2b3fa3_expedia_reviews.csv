Breakfast was the best I've ever had from a hotel. The room was clean and looked newly renovated. It was pleasant.,8,Jesse,2025-10-03
the food is te terrible,8,Lawrence,2025-10-02
I was highly impressed with the cleanliness of this hotel. Our hotel room was literally spotless and smelled fresh. The staff were warm and welcoming. This is a great location and an easy drive into Denver. Many restaurants are nearby in walking distance. The only downside to the hotel is the continental breakfast was awful. But I think that’s the nature of hotel continental breakfast in general. ,10,Isaiah,2025-10-01

"Booked for one overnight because this hotel was next to the surgery center where i was having a procedure the next morning.  The room was clean and comfortable,  but the woman working check in was horribly rude and disrespectful to both myself and my partner.  ",8,Beth,2025-09-30

Clean and quiet.  Great breakfast options ,10,Theresa,2025-09-28
I think one of the things I didn’t like was the fact one of the elevators were not as reactive and yet stop at different floors even though there isn’t anyone standing by for the elevator at those floors. Also I find it somewhat troubling that there not a whole lot of tables available during the complementary breakfast. I do noticed that they had the conference rooms open for that reason. ,8,Abelardo,2025-09-28

"This was a great hotel! The breakfast was good, the facility was nice. The service was a little slower, we asked for some towels to be brought up and they were never delivered. We went and asked the front desk after several hours and they were able to give us some. I don't think there should be a charge for parking as it is not in a gated area, it's just in the parking lot behind the hotel and is accessible from 2 different streets. Other than that, it was great. Nice, quiet area with shopping and food close by. ",8,Jennifer,2025-09-22

"The room was great! Very clean and had everything we needed for our stay. I will say that the mini fridge in the room didn’t seem to work but we didn’t really need to use it. The breakfast was good, had the same few things the 3 morning we partook so if you’re looking for variety don’t hold your breath but was a good breakfast nonetheless. Wish parking was included too but it’s not bad for a short trip.",10,Justin,2025-09-21

The stay was great. There was one issue with the restroom. The design of the restroom was a bit odd. The toilet was too close to the door and it just seemed like the restroom was a bit small. Sort of a weird layout. ,10,Jarrod,2025-09-12

"The beds were not comfortable, one elevator was out of service so with six floors and a full hotel, one had to wait a long time or take five flights of stairs.  Breakfast did not include any meat, and the food was almost always out, or not fresh.",6,Jason,2025-09-04

"I did not get the room I booked. I booked a room with two queen beds and was told they only have a room with one king. Front desk lady was not helpful or friendly. Breakfast, I watch the guy wipe the floor with a rag and use that same rag to wipe a table. This place sure went down hill. ",4,Joe,2025-08-20
easy on/off Hwy25.  Breakfast area not large enough and started late on weekends.  Room layout was poor - bathroom sink and mirror were right in front of beds.  Turning on the light at the sink blinded anyone still in sleeping.,8,Erin,2025-08-19

"When I went to check out the girl told me that the parking fees were waived, but a few days later I was charged on my credit card.  The woman who checked us in was miserable.  Very unfriendly and only put us in for 1 night instead of the 3 we had reserved.  On day 2 our key cards didn’t work and we were locked out of our rooms. ",4,Judy,2025-08-16

"This was a clean and comfortable hotel in a nice neighborhood. It was centrally located to everything we wanted to do in the Denver area. The staff was friendly and the hotel felt very safe. The pool was nice. Our room was roomy for the five of us. The hot breakfast was not overly fancy, but no one went hungry. There was something there for everyone to enjoy. One of the elevators was not working and the other was a bit slow. It was not a perfect place, some reviews may bear that out. But for the money, it couldn't be beat. Again the property felt safe and everything was clean and comfortable. I plan on staying here with my family again. ",10,Corey,2025-08-04

"Made the reservation, and got a call the day of my stay saying they overbooked themselves and they were cancelling my reservation.  On top of that, they told me they already charged me and they weren't issuing a refund, and I would have to go through Expedia to deal with it. Also there is a hidden parking fee each night.   They probably could have handled the situation better.",2,chris,2025-07-28

"It was nice stay 
Every thing was excellent but the elevator ",8,Hadia,2025-07-14
"This hotel was in a good location as it was across the street from a great walking park.  Our room was very spacious. i think we could have slept 6 people in there. It had 2 queens and a pull out couch. The breakfast had a lot of options.  
There were a few things not working properly.
Our coffe maker in our room broke and burned the coffee. we got a new coffee pot but our room smelled for a while. The pool was indoor but it was freezing. Everyone who got in said the same thing. We were told it was heated but there is no way it was working. 
We weren’t aware that it is not a full service hotel according the the front desk. We asked why our room was not cleaned and we were told because it isn’t a full service hotel so they only clean room every 3 days! On the Expedia app. however it says daily room service.   We also had to pay a daily rate to park in their parking lot.  I’ve never had to do that before, but in looking around at other hotels in the Denver Tech area, it seemed a few of the hotels choose to do charge for parking also. 
Breakfast was good, but sometimes they ran out of food before breakfast was over. sometimes there was no where to sit to eat. The breakfast staff worked very hard and tried to keep the food coming, the demand seemed to be faster than what they could keep up with. 
I might stay there again in the future as I really liked the access to the park and I liked the room a lot.  ",6,Wende,2025-07-14
"The hotel and the room was very clean and well maintained. Breakfast had good options. One downside is parking fee, it's normal parking lot and not a heavy traffic area, not sure why the parking fee.
The reason for reducing 1 star though is for front desk staff, during check-in, breakfast or any other interaction with them was cold with no enthusiasm nor smile.",8,Rakesh,2025-07-12

"Stayed at the Hyatt Place Denver Tech Center for a short business trip. Overall, it was fine—nothing stood out as particularly great or bad. The room was clean and spacious enough, and the bed was comfortable. The staff was polite but not especially engaging. Breakfast was the standard fare you'd expect, and the location was convenient for where I needed to be. If you're looking for a basic, no-frills stay in the area, this place gets the job done.

"Clean, spacious, and friendly staff. ",10,Javier,2025-05-11
There were very few things that I liked about my stay at the Hyatt.  What I didn't like is that the bathroom floor was dirty when I checked in.  What I didn't like is that the TV didn't work as advertised.  What I didn't like  is that there was very little toilet paper when we got into the room.  I spoke to the front desk and they said they would bring it up...after too much time...I went down and got it myself.  I didn't like that they clean the room every 3rd day.  Why would a hotel not clean a room especially when I asked for it to be done.  Not happy with Hyatt at all.,4,georges,2025-05-11
,2,Marina,2025-05-10
"At check in there was no information provided about the property itself, aside from what room number we were in. Not a peep was shared about breakfast start/end times, when the pool opened/closed, where the pool was located, when housekeeping would clean our room (which turned out to be every 3rd day), where the elevators were, etc… We were given our room key from a grumpy front desk supervisor and that was it. 

Other staff members were quite friendly, especially the folks working at breakfast time but overall I was very disappointed with how we were treated. This was my third stay at a Hyatt in the last 6 months and this was by far my worst experience at ANY hotel, EVER! The GM is a real treat too who shouldn't be in the hospitality industry at all as she is the furthest from “hospitable or accommodating”, charging us $1470 USD for not fulfilling our group block, which I was lead to believe was a courtesy agreement, but was ultimately just a manipulative money grab especially considering the hotel was completely full during our stay. 

The beds were comfy and the rooms were spacious. The elevators were dreadful and breakfast was mediocre with only 2 hot items to choose from which staff never seemed to able to keep up to the demand of the guests. Coffee was decent too, when there was some to be had. 

Overall this experience ruined my time in Denver and I will never stay at a Hyatt ever again and neither should you.",6,Marina,2025-05-10

"The property was ok. The kitchen was flooding every morning. It stunk. Although they were trying desperately to fix the plumbing problem. The disappointment was with the fact the pool was closed. I picked this property specifically for the indoor pool. The manager apologized and offered me Hyatt Points. I was told the pool was closed because they had to empty it and clean it because when she was on vacation noone tended to the pool. I was also promised it would be fixed and ready the next day. The pool was finally ready our last day, late afternoon, but of course too cold for swimming. We were there 5 nights. Also, I still have not received the points I was promised. Disappointing.",4,Annette,2025-05-05
"The two ladies at the front desk were obviously too busy to be bothered by guests who wanted to check in. When one finally took time to do it she was pushy and rude. She asked for my id and as i was retrieving it from my wallet asked for it four more times until i snapped and told her i was getting it if she'd be just a bit patient.  The hotel & room was clean, and pleasant, but i didn't appreciate having to pay for parking",6,Michele,2025-05-02
"The flooring is new, the front desk staff friendly and they checked people in while still serving a few of us in the bar. We were glad to see they had a small menu. 
The room was very spacious, with a sitting area, separate bed area a kitchen set up and work table. The only strange thing was with all that space, the bathroom was too small and cramped, where you have to step completely inside to close the door. The door is too close to the toilet.

"The property was what you would expect from a tech center or business property staff was not at the front desk upon arrival we had to find a housekeeper to call the front desk person.

The room was about average no stove top one of the elevators was not working properly leaving guest having to push the door close from the outside to get on the second one.

The price for parking is unnecessary and really just a ploy to charge more the property has a onsite parking lot that they charge a fee for while saying they arent responsible for anything happening to your car which negates the reason to pay for parking.

There isnt many food places close the area itself is dead on weekends no need to stay here to have a good time or explore, just stay in the city or aurora itself. 3 out of 10

"This was my worst Hyatt experience. The room I was placed in, after a day of driving across the country, was on the first floor, sharing a wall with the gym and the kitchen was directly across from me. Needless to say, I was unable to sleep in. Additionally despite the appearance of rhe Hyatt looking excellent from the front when I arrived, my room had a horrible view on the first floor as it was tucked in a weird corner. Lastly, the gentleman who checked me in was professional BUT far from hospitable. Ultimately, this Hyatt had multiple floors and very likely multiple other open rooms on a Wednesday night in March, the room was placed in was offensive to say the least. Combine the horrible room with apathetic ""hospitality"" and this is by far my worst Hyatt experience to date.",2,Danielle,2025-03-28

"Arrived late night (2am) after a long flight delay. Check in was very friendly and welcoming. Saturday morning, the fire alarm went off around 730am and continued for an hour. We were on the 4th floor and went downstairs to see many other guests ""business as usual"" enjoying breakfast. No communication was made to guests what was happening and the desk was un-manned. Sent my husband and kiddo back up the stairs to try to get more rest while i grabbed breakfast which was very good for complimentary. Fire dept arrived and were able to silence the alarm.
The room was very spacious (2 queen beds) and clean. Only complaint was the bathroom was extremely small. Pretty much had to stand in the tub to open the door. The sink and vanity were outside of where the toilet and shower were. 
I thought the bed was uncomfortable, but my family didnt mind so it was just preference. We appreciated the sofa, desk, fridge, sink, and glassware. We were centrally located to the airport and our main destination (casa bonita). Check out was easy on the app as we never did see another desk attendant after the first check in late at night.

"Arrived right in time for 3:00 check in. We were told our room wasn’t ready yet. Not ok after traveling with a baby all day. After waiting for the room to be cleaned, tried to get to the 6th floor in the elevator. One elevator was out of service. Again, not ok for a sold out 6 story hotel. Mind you, the 2nd elevator was not in service for our entire 5 day stay. This single elevator was also shared by house keeping and their large carts. The Hyatt also advertises quick things to eat such as pizzas and sandwiches. We reserved this hotel with that in mind for our toddler. I asked to order and was told they don’t do that. False advertising in their part even though the entire dining area has QR codes to scan for the food. The pool was ice cold. We did not enjoy the stay.

Rowdy children filled the waiting room making it difficult for someone with a disability to navigate with a service dog. The hotel charged $30 parking. The pool was dirty. Only one working elevator (I had requested a bottom floor at time of reservation but that was not provided) so the wait was several minutes forthe elevator without a chair present.

"I would like to start by saying i would have loved to given a better rating. Multiple factors played a part from when first checked in untill we left. I felt extremely uncomfortable as one of the females was constantly in clothes that are horribly revealing! Didnt match what the property was trying to display. We have young boys that even said something about how he could see her belly.The first day corn on the cob all over the parking lot, we had to clean our room/ we took pictures. The beds Are uncomfortable, The pillows made our necks and backs hurt really bad. There was a horrible stench in our room like wet dogs,not to mention no one told us we would have to to park at the hotel we already paid to stay at for the wedding, we are out of state, was never mentioned. When we requested ourbroom be serviced because their was 1 little trash can and we needed towels and beds made it was a problem by the time we came back still nothing was done finally showed up at about 4 pm. We tried to go swimming and it was freezing cold.all in all i feel like this could have been better and more up front about all fees.",6,Alisha marie,2024-08-12

Overall the hotel was average. Beware if you book in advance with Expedia or other that the hotel will not honor your choices no matter how far in advance you booked.  I paid for 1 night for 2 rooms with what was supposed to be 2 queens beds in each.  The night attendant very clearly related to me that I would not receive that.

Although this property is in the tech center district we must have arrived in between conferences and meetings.  No large crowds and easy parking was a plus for us. A six level building has the business vibe to it.  Rooms were clean and has small refrig and bar sink.  Beds were ok for comfort (6 out of 10) and AC was acting up.  Warm and cold cycling which was not consistent making peaceful rest a bit difficult (6 out of 10).  Seems like a safe area but not alot of options for food in walking difference,8,Len,2024-07-24

Also, the breakfast was gross. Given the cost of the stay, I was hoping not to spend on breakfast but ended up having to take my family out.

"We stayed here for 1 night for a concert near by and it was a terrific option!  There were 3 of us, so we chose the 2 queen room with a pull out sofa and it literally was the perfect size.  
Staff was very friendly and speedy when we needed extra linen.  
Parking was super easy.  Access in and out was easy.  Room was clean.
We didn't get to eat the breakfast, so cannot speak to that.
There was another restaurant next door that we ate dinner at, that was great.
The only negative and we didn't ask if they knew about it, but it smelled like septic in the hall down stairs and in the elevator, but NOT our room.
Overall, we were very happy.

(I'm also comparing this property to the Marriott DTC, 2 or so mile away that we stayed at 3 weekends ago).  It was old, outdated, room was sooo dirty and we paid double for that hotel).  
So this Hyatt was a very pleasant surprise compared to that!  ",8,Nora,2024-07-01

Was told the room was soundproof, but definitely heard movement from the room above, and their shower run at 11pm…",8,Andrew,2024-06-27
Good clean facility and staff was very nice. Excellent for the blonde at the front desk my last day. I asked about extending my stay and extra couple days and one lady said yes. The blonde lady interrupted and said no we can not. I left it at that. I just told her I'd go somewhere else. After that her attitude was a surprised oh! If they don't want my money I'll gladly give it to another business. That is the only negative thing I can say. The stay and the rest of the staff was worth every penny I spent.

"I am writing to share my recent experience at your hotel, which unfortunately was very disappointing. After checking out, I realized that I had forgotten my laptop in the room. I immediately called the hotel from the airport to report the issue, but when I followed up after my flight, I was told that the laptop could not be found. As a guest, I trusted that my belongings would be secure in your hotel, and it is extremely upsetting that my laptop has gone missing under your care. I am certain that I left it in the room, and the fact that it could not be located by the staff leads me to believe that it was stolen by one of your employees.The lack of responsibility and care demonstrated by your hotel has left me deeply dissatisfied and has negatively affected my overall experience. I expect a resolution to this matter, as the loss of my laptop has caused significant inconvenience and stress. Needless to say I will never stay at this hotel again.

"We had to call down for sheets and pillows for the pullout bed even though they knew we had our son with us.  We were charged a pet fee after we booked with hotels.com and had to pay for parking every night.  That totaled almost $100 more than I was quoted on Hotels.com
The breakfast was okay but the coffee was super weak even with them saying it was starbucks brand.  The staff were nice.  The space was clean and it was easy to get to places.  We were there for a baseball tournament.  Would probably stay somewhere else next time. ",6,Verified traveler,2024-05-27

The room was quiet, way clean and brand new, so no repairs were visible.  The room had a couch, table, fridge and bar area as well as an ample closet and drawer space.  Shower was super and towels were soft and didn’t smell like strong antiseptic though they were obviously sanitized.  The bed was so ver comfortable and sheets were fresh smelling.  Super soft comfy pillows. Parking behind the hotel was ample with multiple entryways.  Highly recommend.",10,Gregg,2024-05-25

Pros:Free breakfast, easy parking,bedding was comfortable and clean room.
Cons
This was a huge con for us. My teenage daughter went swimming and showered immediately after.Then came home the next day and showered and washed her hair multiple times and can not get the chlorine smell out of her hair.Not to mention her hair feels so dry and brittle. We are a family that travels and stays in hotels at least 30  times a year. We have never ever had this issue.Now we are having to look up solutions and possibly buy her stuff to fix her hair.I understand wanting to keep the pool clean but there was way to much chlorine put in there.",8,Shaundene,2024-05-20

"First of all we visit Denver at least once a year. We stayed here for 9 consecutive days So I think we have good view of the property. 

4 stars because :
1. Housekeeping missed us. We were told at check in that housekeeping would come every other day. We checked in on Saturday. 
They came on Monday as promised. But missed Wednesday. I had to ask twice to have the room serviced. They finally came late Thursday. It went ok after that 
2: Breakfast. Yes it’s “free” but the food was often cold and they constantly ran out of coffee. Also their seating was short of serving the number of  guests. 

Other than this the room was nice and staff is very friendly and accommodating.

The alarm of the office building behind the property was going off all night. Every 15 minutes lights and sound. I alerted the front desk staff at 5:30 am after not sleeping all night and the clerk did not seem to comprehend what I was saying. The pool was also freezing which was disappointing as we rented the room as a staycation for our little one. She didnt get to sleep all night due to the noise and couldnt stand the cold water for more than 15 min. The staff was nice and the hotel was very clean. Noise was what made the stay horrible. ,10,Cynthia,2024-04-27

"We chose this hotel since it was a few blocks from the freeway. Unfortunately, we were able to hear loud trucks and cars from the nearby roads outside of the hotel. We also paid extra for an upper floor, thinking that would prevent loud people above us, but we still had loud walkers in the room above. So I guess that was a waste of money. 
I also love nice pillows - I assumed since this was a Hyatt, that they would have comfortable beds and pillows. Unfortunately, the beds were fairly stiff and the pillows were cheap foam-filled pillows without much give. That was a big disappointment. I can deal with a stiff bed, but I need soft pillows for a restful sleep. 
The staff were friendly, but the noise and especially the pillows I would not recommend this hotel. ",6,James,2024-04-25

The lady who checked us in was horrible.. I mean so rude. We paid the $10 parking fee and whatever other charges.  We asked about where the parking was and she just said somewhere in the back and rolled her eyes. I was a little confused because we paid for parking so I thought she would have gave us a little direction as to wheat we would do. So I just figured we were in so we went and parked and I realized everyone had a parking pass in their window and a sign said we’d be towed if we didn’t have that.  I’m guessing this lady that checked us in wanted us towed? Or didn’t really care. I went back down to the desk and thank goodness another lady was there .. she was super nice and apologized for the previous lady. Gave us our parking pass and got down what car we had. ,8,Jenna,2024-04-22

The entire staff was incredibly pleasant, friendly, helpful, and attentive to anything we needed. Breakfast was great, so many options for different tastes.

"To begin with, the hotel was listed as pet-friendly.  Upon check-in, we were told we could not have a cat which meant we had to leave him with family.  I know that had I called to clarify, the problem could have been avoided, but I also think more clarity in the reservation process would be helpful.  With that said, as we were waiting for the elevator, we were growled at by a very intimidating dog.  Is there a vetting process for dogs? 

Upon check-out, the key was deactivated 40 minutes prior to the check-out time (which we clarified the evening before). We had not indicated that we were checking out and one of us had to remain in the room to let the other in while we were loading up to leave. This was inconvenient. 

I will say that we needed to add a night to our reservation and the person at the front desk was extremely helpful and accommodating.  We definitely appreciated that. ",6,Marc,2023-12-28

- Pull out couch had no linens anywhere in the room, I had to call and wait an extra half hour to receive anything) and once pulled out had food crumbs all over it. It was so excruciatingly uncomfortable only children could sleep on it. 
- although breakfast food was good enough, there is no logical place to sit. The dining area is completely non-functional for more than a couple people.

Cons: When I arrived at the hotel, it took about 15 minutes until a lady (short blond hair with a bright color in it) came out to check us in, when I asked her a question, she snapped and said ""I'll share all details at the end"", where she failed to answer any questions I had. The elevator reeked with smoke, our room floor was COVERED in DOG HAIR!! And the pull out couch was COVERED IN DOG HAIR! Went down to get sheets, and the same front desk lady made me wait about 10 minutes to ask a question, she said she would send it right up. We waited for 45 minutes, then had to leave so I went to inform her that I would get the sheets when I got back and she said she was busy and couldn't request them again in a rude manner. We got back to the hotel about 3 hours later, I stopped by the front desk on my way in and she said the sheets were in our room. I DO NOT appreciate anyone going in our room while we were out as I specifically told the front desk lady I would retrieve them once I returned to the hotel!! The pool was freezing cold, and we have minimum supplies in our room such as pillows, towels, and toiletry items. I wouldn't stay at this hotel if there was room at different locations near this area. ",6,Whitney,2023-11-06

This has been the worst hotel of this chain that I have stayed in. The first day the room was delivered dirty. They gave us the option of having another room and in this one the sheets had blood. We throw them aside so the cleaning staff can take them away and notify management. The next day the cleaning service came to our room and used the same dirty sheets that we threw aside to dress our beds. It is totally unacceptable and unhygienic what the cleaning staff did. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!,4,Harriet,2023-10-18

"Clients book hotels based on amenities as described. When a hotel like Hyatt Place Denver Tech offers NONE of the advertised amenities clients WILL have issues.
We booked this hotel b/c my daughter had been hospitalized in a Denver treatment center, one of only TWO in the US that treats her condition, for two months.
Her beloved younger brother hadn’t seen her in 8 weeks. We took him out of school & flew him to Denver so he could sit in the hospital w/her 4 hrs per day, then booked Hyatt Place Tech Center so he’d have a nice place to swim & relax after spending most of the nerve-racking days in a hospital w/dying people.
FAIL! Hyatt Denver Tech Center’s pool had been non-functional for WEEKS! But they didn’t bother to notify us or any other clients. Breakfast was also a fiasco, the kitchen staff has NO interest in keeping the breakfast area equipped; meanwhile 40 clients are wandering around fighting over breakfast table seats & no milk or juice. An absolute hell-hole. Despicable.",2,Kimberly,2023-10-18

Sink was clogged and had issues.

Bathroom flush was not that great.

house keeping team comes only on alternate days and when they came they didn’t make the bed well. They didnt even put enough towels or bathroom issues. Had to go to the front office to get additional towels and toilet papers.

They charge for parking $7 per night but they don’t take any responsibility. When asked they said they have a fake camera installed but it’s not a real camera.. if you are charging for parking, you are responsible for the vehicle safety. ",4,Verified traveler,2023-10-10

"Great location and space in room to spread out.

No major complaints but had a couple:
1. Pay for parking although it’s just an open lot with no security or garage. Makes no sense why guests need to pay. 
2 water pressure in shower was all but non existent 
3. No real blanket/covers on beds. So thin it was like there were like 2 sheets.
4. Not enough towels in room either, had booked room for 4 guests but was provided 2 towels.

Main floor didn’t have any working bathroom due to remodel of facility. Staff in front wasn’t the friendliest and did not feel secure.

My husband lost her room key and was walked back up to our room and let in because they ran out of keys. Concern here is they didn’t even verify who he was or if he was named on the reservation. While I am glad they let him in, disappointed they did not verify he should have been there. 

While many items listed, truly I would stay here again. Price was great even with additional pet rent.

Expect to NOT be notified if changes are made to your reservation and you are now staying at a different place other than what was originally booked & when you check in the front desk will not explain why your paying more than booked price. I was originally booked at the “sister” hotel that apparently over booked and was switched to this hotel. Upon arrival the guy at the front desk was not friendly & said our rates are higher & it’s not my job to notify you of changes. ,2,Katelynn,2023-06-28
"I had booked a one King sized bed with a sofa bed. I ended up with a room with a King sized bedroom with a half completed connected room that had the sofa bed. They had not completed the renovation in that room as you can see in the pictures. The side desk wasn't assembled nor attached to the wall. There was an exposed electric pole, beds stacked on top of another, no sink, along with items left on the floor. When I told the front desk lady she said she would let maintenance know, which she was trying to be helpful but it wasn't at all. She did say they had just remodeled but never mentioned it anywhere. 
Even then if they did announce it, it should not be acceptable to rent out unsafe rooms.  NOT WORTH THE PRICE.",2,Cynthia,2023-06-27

"At first glance we were happy with the hotel and room. We knew in advance the hotel was under construction, and wasn't a big deal. Our room was large enough for our family of 6 and looked nice.
After we settled in we began to notice things though. 
There were old towls hanging on the back of the bathroom door, and there was hair and hair ties on the bathroom floor. The Kleenex box was empty. There was no extra bedding for the pullout couch. There were no throw away cups, and the glass cups provided were filthy with coffee and fingerprints. 
When my husband and I finally got the kids down, we pulled back our sheets and it looked like there was sock lint at the bottom of the bedding as if someone slept in there socks and the sheets weren't changed.
The next morning, the already low tp was gone and there was no replacement rolls. The heating element was put on the hair dryer. And unfortunately, I am tall enough to have noticed a dirty rag and condoms that were thrown on top of a cabinet and left. 
I am a pretty easy going person. Traveling with four kids means you may have to sacrifice a little to make a trip work, but if I would have noticed the bed and condom issue before I had put the kids down for the night we would have been complaining and switching rooms. 
I took photos of all of the issues, but the review will not allow me to upload them.

The hotel is under construction. There was so much construction going on the hotel should not be open. I feel like I got scammed and ripped off. One day we had to step over broken tiles they were removing just to get to the elevator. The breakfast room was disgusting/makeshift. None of the hotel amenities are available. Worst experience at a hotel in my life. Everyday we had to deal with very loud hammer drilling which completely disrupted my business calls and work. Booking had no warning - which is totally dishonest of Hyatt. Don’t stay here until it’s done. Go to a Marriott. The room was newly refurbished and clean but not stocked well- we had to ask for soap and they didn’t clean the room the first day we were there.

Pool and gym not accessible, could drive to other Hyatt to use (however still not convenient).  They should tell you they are under renovation when booking.

"Rating: ★★☆☆☆

During our stay at the hotel, we had a mixed experience. While the lower cost was appealing, ongoing renovations resulted in the closure of amenities such as the pool and fitness room. The hotel layout was also confusing, and construction impacted our overall experience. However, the recently renovated rooms were impressively clean and well-appointed, and the staff at the front desk were friendly and accommodating. 

Despite the construction inconveniences, the hotel could still be a viable choice for a comfortable stay if you appreciate the renovated rooms and can overlook the ongoing renovations. However, if easy access to amenities and a hassle-free experience are your top priorities, it might be best to explore alternative options until the renovations are complete. Ultimately, it depends on your personal preferences.",6,Tony,2023-05-25

"Do not stay here for a while. The web site no Expedia tells you this property is being renovated! Checking in there were a couple of men working on their knees behind the counter, we were greeted and lead to a back room where a temporary lobby was in disrepair. First morning we were awakened by jackhammering and dust everywhere, even on the sixth floor! Hyatt you will not be forgiven !",2,Bruce,2023-05-13

I brought all my bags up to do some reorganizing before my flight. The floor had several wet spots which turned my white socks a weird color. I didn’t bother changing rooms because I was exhausted and it seemed like more work. I just expected more from a Hyatt. ,4,rachel,2023-05-09

"Fundamentally, the rooms in this hotel have an awkward layout that doesn't make good use of the space. The decor is also quite drab and makes the rooms feel dark and dated. They're in the middle of a renovation which can fix that problem but not the weird floor plan. ",6,Dan,2023-05-04

"Extremely easy to get to, kind and friendly staff but the rooms are a little old/out dated. We did not get the room we booked on Expedia. It was a Similar room  but definitely not the room we booked and it wasn't an upgrade. Would stay there again. ",8,Allison,2023-04-28
They are doing a major remodel. Otherwise rating would have been higher.  The people were great. ,8,Brenda,2023-04-26
"The location and parking are great. The rooms and common area are nice.  The breakfast was great. The staff was very helpful. But.. the walls are paperthin. The was a guest in the room next to me that I could easily hear.  He has the TV blasting into the wee hours.  I did call the front desk and they called the guest who turned off the TV.  I could hear him on the phone in the next room!  There was some construction going on, but that wasn't a big deal.  Everything was good except the lack of soundproofing between rooms.",4,Katherine,2023-04-20

Terrible experience! There is construction going on all hours of the day. The construction company and foreman do not follow quiet hours. The assistant general manager also does not do anything other than give you points in your account and a bottle of wine for the noise. Completely disrespectful and ridiculous. ,2,Kristina,2023-04-16

"For the price I loved the quiet area it was located, definitely going to be one of the hotels I stay in when I’m in Denver. The accommodations were fantastic,  I loved the hot breakfast options, it’s delicious. The chilled fruit was my absolute favorite. 10/10 
I loved that the check out time is later than most. I had no issues with anything, the service was spot on! ",10,Kimberly,2023-03-27

The hotel is going renovation so do not expect to sleep at all. I had a horrible experience the room across  my #305 had a dog that didn't stop barking at night and the sounds of the construction early in the morning wouldn't help. The hallway was always dirty and the elevators it was a mess. ,6,Diana,2023-03-13

"To start with our room was not clean, it hadn’t been vacuumed, floor was stained, surfaces had not been wiped down and there was a dirty towel hanging behind the bathroom door. I tried to let it go but the next morning I went to breakfast for coffee, a nice lady in front me said she took the last of it and would let the front desk know, I followed to make sure. So I waited, the lady at the front desk and another employee were busy talking. I continued to wait and wait. I finally went over and asked again for coffee. Then we took our kids to the pool, there were no towels so back to front desk I went. I was not happy. Not only was this entire hotel not clean, elevators included, the service was terrible!

"I wasn’t told the property was u set construction until my arrival and already checked in. I was told construction would be done from 08:30-5:30 every day of my stay, which is a problem in itself. However, they started at 7:45 both mornings I was there. And apparently they were doing all the construction directly above my room. 
I also was traveling light for work purposes and needed to use the provided hair dryer. The first one overheated in 30 seconds. The second barely blew air at all before I gave up. 
The room was spacious, decently clean. Albeit, the entire building made me cough incessantly due to sawdust and sheetrock dust. 
The staff was incredibly kind and helpful, which was definitely the best part of the stay. The bed was comfortable and the vanity area was an excellent size. 
I just wish I had been warned about the above mentioned issues before my stay, so I could have decided if I wanted to stay elsewhere. ",6,Charis,2023-01-08
