Loveedddd the staff they made my experience amazing ,10,Strangae,2025-09-28
"I’ve stayed here before on an higher floor and had a much better experience than this most recent stay. Room was clean and nice but bathroom was tiny and kept hitting myself on shower door handle when using the room. Hallway carpet was noticeably stained and either needs to be cleaned or replaced. Other guests were in and out all night, slamming doors and having entire conversations in the hallway as if they were in their own home. Got very little sleep. ",6,Anne,2025-09-26

"Disappointing Customer Service Overshadowed My Stay

The room and hotel itself were satisfactory, and the rates on Expedia were good. However, my experience was ruined by the way staff handled an important package that had been delivered to the property for me. The front desk could not locate it and told me to speak with the supervisor, who then directed me to email the operations manager. Unfortunately, the manager never responded.

This lack of care, accountability, and follow-through left me without essential items I needed for my trip, and I could not replace them in time. To make matters worse, each time we passed the front desk, staff avoided eye contact, which only reinforced my impression of guilt and indifference.

While the accommodations met expectations, the unprofessional handling of my package and the dismissive attitude of the staff left me with a very negative impression. Sadly, this bad experience put a huge damper on what should have been an enjoyable stay.",4,Ajene,2025-09-12

I had a terrible check in experience at this hotel.,8,Verified traveler,2025-05-03

"The shower leaked constantly after every shower, so we would have to ask for many towels to keep the floor from flooding. The bed in the room was not the same as what I booked and the room didn’t even have a fridge. The staff was okay, there was only friendly faces when we left the hotel. Area is great and near a lot of shopping spots, but difficult to locate for Ubers.",4,Joelle,2025-04-29

There was mold all over my window that I couldn’t even see anything outside from my room,6,Justin,2025-03-31
"Overall we would stay here again, but for a couple of points. 
Firstly there's a lot of work in the street, and so a lot of scaffolding to duck and dodge.
Secondly there was a constant hum in the room. We turned off the A/c, to make sure it wasn't that. We thought that it may have been something associated with the building work going on in the street. But on further investigation, and going up to the top floor in the stairwell. It became obvious that the noise was coming from the roof of the hotel itself. Not sure if this is the Buildings A/c unit, or something else. But it was sending the vibration noise through the building. 
We were on the 13th floor (of 17) and if we were to stay again, I'd want to be on the 10th floor or less, just to avoid the noise.",8,Paul,2025-03-27

"The hotel has a good accessibility. Room size is small. But the hospitality is totally gone for a toss. The manager Mr. Crystal Estepa fraudulently charged my credit card Rs.2500 more than a month after my stay was over, that too without any prior permission. Sadly when you travel back to other country there's no way you can recover your money. They wont accept money through pre paid travel cards. And once they make any payment through your credit card then God help you. They will store its entire info and charge you anytime after you leave the place even if you clear your dues.

"Here are the things you should know about before you book this hotel. One, they will charge you days before your actual trip so be ready for that banking statement. Two, the location is in a VERY sketchy alleyway. I as a woman did not feel safe whatsoever in such a location that so dark, filled with trash, and sewer. Three, service overall is very bad. The hallways smelled of weed and they have a place downstairs for utensils (which are never stocked) and one lone microwave that barely works. 4, the WiFi goes out occasionally so dont expect to have it all the time. Overall just be careful and make sure you know what you’re getting into before booking here.",4,Kole,2024-12-07

"Die Zimmer sind sehr hellhörig, die Klimaanlage super laut und schäppernd.
Man hat den Aufzug schlagen hören, wenn er hoch und runter gefahren ist.
Wir waren abends so müde, dass es nicht groß gestört hat, jedoch sollte einem das bewusst sein.
Das Klo war auch nur mit einer sehr wackeligen Schiebetür vom restlichen Zimmer getrennt. Man hört jeden Atemzug.

Gegenüber vom hotel ist direkt ein toller irish pub, der genauso einen riesigen Pluspunkt bringt wie die Haltestellen direkt um die Ecke und das OWTC.
Brooklyn bridge war auch direkt um die Ecke. Die Lage war also mehr als perfekt. Frühstücken kann man in zig Spots um das hotel rum.

Das Personal war sehr freundlich.
Es gab immer Kaffee und Tee um sonst im Eingangsbereich sowie billiard im Barbereich.

"Highly recommend. The place is in a convenient spot. It’s in between the World Trade Center, financial district and the Brooklyn bridge. There was maintenance everyday so the room was spotless. 
I would say that there is sometimes smell of weed. If that is not a problem to you then this is a great place to stay. If you cannot tolerate the smell I would recommend another hotel. ",10,Kiara,2024-08-06

"The front-desk employees were helpful and polite. Our room smelled like marijuana, but there were no other rooms available.  So we stayed there (we arrived at 2:00 from a delayed flight). The odor got better the next day. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. There is no microwave nor mini-fridge in the room.  Just FYI. There is complimentary ice water and hot water in the lobby. ",8,Colleen,2024-07-17

My first night I noticed the sheets weren’t clean on the bed. I had to call for new sheets. The bathroom door is dirty. It needs a good wipe down. And final I brought my own washcloth and it was taken by housekeeping when they came to clean the room. ,6,Verified traveler,2024-05-20
"The staff were great for a stay of 3 days, I needed an early check-in. The proximity to Chinatown area was the motivation. There was a luggage stow service which I was glad I didn’t have to use as it didn’t seem particularly secure. Location -the street has so many potholes & scaffolding that several taxis would not actually go down Ann st. They stopped several blocks away. 
There were issues with TV not working properly, to change the station one had to use menu then select the written option conversely if one used the arrows up & down , ( which is international standard) then tv went to static. , I went thru 3 coffee machines (wasn’t outlets)  But  Beatrice & Anna from housekeeping were wonderful! The desk staff were kind & attentive. I’ve stayed in Alofts before, this seemed more like a pod room, the lighting is very dark through out the hallways, which just makes it dismal. The elevator was grim! The toilet was ridiculously low, it sprayed water out when flushing. There was a window that opened in the room, but prevalent sirens were loud &  unexpected. As for the Pod like feel - each  shower there was a minor flood in the room. It’s hard to adjust the water temperature without the floor getting very wet! 
My expectations of the Fidi, were it would be very quiet &clean, whenever I’ve stayed in an Aloft previously they were roomy, immaculate and quiet. My room outer curtain had many rips, there were gashes in the walls- this wasn’t a bargain booking.

This information would have been good to have prior to booking as I had a number of bags with me. Hotel itself is basic, very noisy and hotel staff especially cleaning staff a little disrespectful taking loud phone calls on speaker phone early in the morning outside and slamming doors as they come in and out of rooms.

"The plus for this property is that it’s by a lot of subway stops, so it’s convenient to get around. The front desk staff was also friendly. We did enjoy the complimentary popcorn and filtered water in the lobby. The a/c worked fairly well in the room too, if we were warm. 

Now for the cons, there were a good bit. The place itself is not very updated, but you get what you pay for. There were multiple times where we ran out of items in the room (toilet paper, towels) and it took more than 30 minutes to get some. The window was broken (it actually almost fell on top of us at one point when we tried to see if it opened). The sheets were sparse and not even a fitted sheet was on the bed. There was no comforter.  We had to put our trench coats on top of us to stay warm at night. A few of the lights didn’t work in the room, with the curtains only opening so far, we had a hard time seeing things in the room bc it was so dark. The shower floor was disgusting and it also leaked onto the bathroom floor bc of a crack in the shower door. Toilet paper holder was also broken. Space was small, but that was expected.  

I wouldn’t stay here again. The reviews were misleading. ",6,Kelli,2024-01-05

"Stayed at this hotel for an overnighter in NYC. The hotel entrance is hidden in an alleyway partly blocked due to construction. But it was not hard to find and did not feel too scary walking down the alleyway. The price of our stay reflected this inconvenience. Otherwise, the hotel itself is nicely located just off Wall St, close to Seaport and China town, and not too bad to the WTC.

Inside the hotel, we were greeted by the hotel staff, checked in very quickly, picked up a scoop of free popcorn to go to our room. Not a big room, but sufficient with a comfortable bed, tv, shower, toilet and basin, for a economical 1-nighter in NYC. Everything looks like it has been refreshed recently, we like the modern design which is on par with other NYC hotels of the similar price range, but was disappointed by the execution, which may deter us from returning without an enticing price. 

The first problem we had was with the TV - could not turn it on. We returned from dinner to find the staff and got the TV working, but only intermittently. Even then, we could not enjoy a good movie night as the movie channels gave us black screens despite the other channels all working.

The second problem is the shower. The glass shower screen door drips water on the raised threshold that is sloped towards the outside of the shower. The result is a mini flood outside the shower door after every shower. Cosmetically, the grout and caulking of the shower and bathroom need to be more professionally done.",6,Spencer,2023-12-31

The only time it was cleaned was because we called and asked. The provided shampoo and conditioner were very drying - I'm having a hard time believing those were Drybar brand.

"I was very disappointed with the appearance of this hotel. I received an email before my arrival, but I was unprepared for my experience. 

They claim to have parking, but they do not. You have to park in a public lot 3 blocks away and you receive a discount. I paid $50 for one night. I could not go in and out without paying again. You then have to walk those 3 blocks with your luggage. Why? Because there's no parking area where you can drop off your baggage. 

The main lobby, which is the main draw for Aloft, looked like an airport. It did not have the style of other Aloft hotels. They has an area with food for sale. The muffin I bought was dry. 

One of the 2 elevators was out of order. The inside of the elevator was scuffed and unappealing.

I asked for a room with a king sized bed. The photo I attached is of a 12 year old sitting on the bed in my room. It was likely a full bed, which I had the share. 

Positives: I asked for a ""city view,"" and my view was decent. The staff is tremendous. The rooms are small, but they do a lot with a little. It's walking distance to the subway. It's close to a university and a hospital. I felt safe. The coffee is still free. ",4,Patrice,2023-11-20

Once we saw charges coming out from an account we challenged the staff, we have been told the extra charges will be released when we check out. Even more charges were added at the last day of stay.

Yes, they let me know about a ongoing construction but what was supposed to be operating, was in very poor conditions (i.e. elevators, bathroom door inside the room). The very front alley of the hotel had vomits and trash the whole 4 days of our stay. Very good location but I would not recommend it. I question how the Aloft franchise let one of their units operate under these conditions.",4,Hugo,2023-10-18
Great,10,Michael,2023-10-16
"This place should be discounted by $100/night or more because there is construction *all around* the building. It's not just scaffolding nearby -- the entire road of that block on Ann Street is being ripped apart, and the sidewalk is boarded up, it can feel a bit sketch just to enter the hotel. You look outside the window and there is a gaping hole with rubble all around. I'm pretty sure it's illegal for the construction crew to start drilling before 8am but they do it anyway, even on the weekends. The rooms aren't soundproofed enough so you hear the neighbors opening/closing their doors. The only redeeming factors: near subway stations, near Joe's Pizza. ",4,Tiara,2023-10-16

"apart from the fact that it is the smallest room that I ever stayed in, there is construction going on in front of the hotel and the road is blocked from both side and there is only a small ally which leads to the hotel, which is very difficult to find for someone who is new. Non of the amenities were working(apparently because of the construction). what has the road construction to do with your gym. Anyway, I told the staff that I am not satisfied with the hotel and that I wanted to checkout early, but the staff was not co-operative and said that they will not refund the money if I checkout early. I am not going to stay at this property again. ",4,Shiva,2023-10-14

"Excellent, wonderful, friendly service - thank you so much! Cute, clean, great location, great price, fun perks, everything was perfect. My only wish is for the rooms to get bluetooth speakers so guests can play their own music. Not loud, just would prefer to not listen to music through my phone while relaxing in the cozy, awesome rooms. Also, need a rooftop or outdoor deck! ",10,kelly,2023-09-25

"Had a great stay, super friendly and helpful staff! We initially saw mixed reviews and were hesitant, but it seems like they went through a rough couple of months with construction. Along with some odd reviews about how the room is small?? It’s New York!?

We are glad we chose to stay here, and would book again!",10,Taylor,2023-09-20

"All of the staff members and managers are excellent, they went above and beyond to make our stay excellent despite renovations and street repair. We asked for a fridge and got one delivered to our room in 5 minutes, we needed ice....again got it quickly. The location was perfect for us. Extremely close the the WTC, Brooklyn Bridge and Wall Street nit far from the Statue of Liberty. There are tons of food options within a couple blocks. The entrance was on Nassau St, the entrance through a door in the green wood wall blocking off Ann St due to construction...a bit weird but completely safe even late at night. We had a king bed with 4 comfortable pillows. The room was on the smaller end but ok as long as you don't have more than 2 suitcases. I will definitely stay here again.",8,Leslie,2023-09-16
This was a very nice hotel. Very reasonable with the price. My flight was cancelled so I needed a hotel and this was perfect. Small room but very clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay again when I'm back in NY.,10,Ladaysha,2023-09-16
They are in the middle of a remodel and so is the street where they are located. This is not mentioned until AFTER you check-in. They have very few amenities until after the remodel.  This should be noted in the hotel info.  ,2,Barbara,2023-09-12

El lugar tiene una construcción de frente que no te permite encontrar con certeza la entrada al hotel … no hay microondas o hielo en la habitación y tampoco tienen variedad aunque sea pagando para comprar comida ligera o snacks.

The hotel was dirty and the rooms barely fit a bed let alone a person, i would not recommend this hotel unless you were desperate.",2,Craig,2023-08-29

So I was a little iffy about the reviews. We took a chance and it paid off big time. Very close to all train stations. A pizza place open till 3 am on the corner. A CVS24 hour  right a round the corner. Right by one world trade center and the 9/11 memorial. It satisfied my needs. I will say the room was really small but I only needed it to sleep.so that did not affect me. People had started it was hard to find because of construction and I felt they had more then enough signs to show me where it was. This is now my go to NYC hotel,10,wesley,2023-08-15

Worst communication ever. Showed up to the hotel just to find out the hotel was closed. Had to call travelocity on the streets with my luggage and it took me 3 hours to recitfy the situation. Extremely dissapointed. Ops manager sends an email 4 days after i was supposed to check in to apologize. Complete joke. ,2,Jerome,2023-05-27

"I could not believe that this Marriott Hotel had NO PARKING GARAGE and NO VALET PARKING.  There is no place to pull your car over so you end up double parked on a very busy street.  My wife went in to inquire about parking and was told to ""just drive around until you find a garage that is not full"".  This is 3pm on a Friday.  No suggestions at all and NO WARNING when booking.",4,Michael,2023-05-15

"Pues muy mal porque llegue del aeropuerto directo al hotel y para mi sorpresa estaba cerrado porque hubo un incidente en un edificio aledaño, pero a mi no me avisaron nada. Y estaba allí en la calle y lloviendo sin lograr comunicarme porque ni siquiera tomaron la previsión de habilitar un número para atender a los huéspedes que llegaban que fue mi caso. Por suerte expedía fueron muy amables y lograron reubicar me pero por parte del hotel nada de nada. Muy mal ",4,Patricia,2023-05-05
"The hotel (and the entire block it’s on) was closed due to construction, but no one bothered to let me know that in advance of my trip. Hotel phone number went to some random guy’s voicemail with no mention of a hotel at all… I arrived at 9 pm, walked all the way around the block with my luggage trying to find a way in, then spent 90+ minutes on the phone with Expedia trying to get a new room. Ultimately, they put me a block away at the Moxy and it’s fine, but it was past 11 when I finally got everything settled and got to check into my place…",2,Adam,2023-04-29
"The staff was very nice. The elevators took a very long time and caused delays in the AM. it took one gust over 20 minutes to get downstairs as he was on an upper floor and had lots of luggage. I took the stairs from the six floor and wound up in some back hallway where I had to push a curtain to the side to find where the walkway continued, probably pretty dangerous if there is an emergency or fire, the room was maybe five / 10 clean. The carpet in the room and hallways was absolutely filthy and probably hasn’t been vacuumed or washed in a very long time. ",4,Jean,2023-04-29

"Came on a last minute stay away from home to enjoy at an Aloft hotel which I've been wanting to try one of their hotel. The area is in the cut in someways in the Wall Street area. There are many places to eat and grab food in the area. The hotel service was good, nothing above and beyond but friendly. We liked the decor especially the lounge area which was playing music and nice place to relax. The room itself was modern, bed was comfy, tv have you everything you wanted to watch and the room had all the amenities you would usually
See and need. Loved the bathroom and how it had a sliding door for privacy. The curtains were a bit outdated so maybe could use to touch ups there but other than that it was a smooth hotel. Would not kind staying here again.",10,Nadia,2023-04-16
