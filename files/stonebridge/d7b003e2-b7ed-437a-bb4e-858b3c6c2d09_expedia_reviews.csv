"Nice property, very friendly staff. My main issue is the mattresses and pillows. Both need to be replaced. Both beds in our room needed to be upgraded and all of the pillows were flat and bumpy. It made it very difficult for us to sleep, we actually had to buy pillows at Costco. I asked for new pillows but they were all super flat and bumpy too. Otherwise this is a great place to stay.

"Amazing property if you want safe and Quiet. The drive to the beach is approximately 15min. The hotel charges $16 per day for parking which is a great price compared to some other Hotels. Rooms are clean, no issues there. The pool is small but who needs a pool when you have an Ocean. I like it and definitely will consider it next time if in the area. ",10,Jovan,2025-06-10

Good hotel but having a pool that open only at 10 am when check out is at 11am is not great when you are only staying a night. ,8,Julien,2025-06-02
"Loved everything, except breakfast. All the meats, pastries, and egg dishes were processed. Even just freshly made scrambled eggs would’ve been a joy but it was clearly something out of a box. ",10,Genevieve,2025-06-02
"The hotel is in a nice area and the hotel is in good shape, but it lacks adequate parking.  I was told to park up the street a block away and then was charged for that parking!  I protested, saying I didn't believe I should have to pay for parking that wasn't even on sight, the desk was not the least sympathetic.  ",6,John,2025-06-02

Wouldn’t let us check in until late after 4 o’clock and was late to our wedding rude people at the front desk two different encounters very unfriendly,2,alfred,2025-05-22
We had originally planned on staying two nights here but had to check out early and got a different hotel due to the dirtiness of the room. My family and I couldn’t sleep well all night from getting itchy sleeping in the bed. ,6,Vivi Ching Yun,2025-05-16
"Meh. Meh free breakfast. Meh rooms. Meh check-in experience. One front desk afent did not give keys to my wife and son cause their names were not on the reservation. Did not bother to ask for IDs or help in anyway. One of the most ""meh"" Hilton's I ever visited in my life. ",4,Timothy,2025-05-13

"The facilities and staff are good.
 I didn't know that pets were allowed, and there were many people with dogs.
 People with allergies, etc., may want to consider staying at the hotel.

Food from the prior guest was left on several bowls and plates as if the guest didnt wash them before putting them away and housekeeping didn’t bother checking to verify the dishes were clean for the next guest. Hotel provided shampoo was empty when I arrived and I had to request a replacement. Housekeeping didn’t bother to remove the kitchen trash upon room refresh until prompted. Bed was uncomfortable. ,6,Dana,2024-08-10

"The hotel was nice but the front desk personnel Service was severely poor.
When they realized we were a Hotel.com guest from a third party guest, they treated us like third class citizens.

A major turn off and made us to reconsider booking through Hotel.com in the future, nor going back to this hotel.

It also made us reflect back on similar incidences in the past booking through your company.

"We stayed in this hotel twice over the last year as it is very family friendly and offers spatious suites. The breakfast has many options, but they are all very low-quality foods (like boxed scrambled eggs with fillers). Only the fruit is fresh. The coffee is always plentiful though. 

Each visit there have been cleanliness issues like soiled carpets and mildew and hair in showers. Housekeeping was never sent to resolve the issue during 3-night stays on either visit.  There is ongoing wear and tear - loose handles and fixtures,  peeling fabric on furniture.  The bed quilt cover is very scratchy and uncomfortable.

After the same issues across two visits,  we will stay somewhere else next time. ",6,Tara,2023-09-04

"Check-in was pleasant. Got to our room to drop luggage and head to a baseball game.  Returned to the room late.  Noticed the poor condition of the bathroom at that time.  The tub had a film on it that I cleaned before using it.  There was rust/red colored substance splattered all over the walls of the bathroom.  The toilet paper holder was bent.  There was a ring around the sink and the baseboards and tile need cleaned/repaired. 

The bed was very squeaky and uncomfortable. The shade screen over the bedroom window didn't open or close.  Wires were exposed like a repair had been started but not complete.  The walls had tape on it directly over the bed.  

As a gold level Hilton nember I can say that this was the worst stay I've had in at least 4 years. ",6,Verified traveler,2023-07-24

"After a 4 1/2 hour drive from Las Vegas with our three small children, we were given a room on the 3 floor. Upon arrival at this room, we found the room was not clean nor ready for people to stay. I have a broken knee so walking to the 3 floor, then back to the front desk was terrible for me. 

When asked if we could get some type of “upgrade” for the businesses mistake, we were told they building was “fully booked. But, we were given another room on the 1 first floor which I appreciated (I just don’t understand how we can get another room when the building is “fully booked”).

 Upon entry into the room we found several cobwebs on all the lamps and lights. In addition, the carpet had small crumbs scattered in certain spots. We were advised up front that Housekeeping would not be attending our room. 

When asked how the Business could accommodate us with these issues, they only offered to “wave” our $20 parking fee. In my opinion, more should have been done. ",6,Bruce,2023-06-04

Also my wife and daughter used the bathroom in the lobby and found the toilet paper was soaking wet. She attempted to tell the front desk how gross this was and the lady at the front gave my wife a hard time and didn’t believe her at first. The room was dirty, it was clear the cleaning crew only does a minimum wipe down after guests check out.The breakfast was very limited in the selection and the first day it was cold and gross. The second day was just as bad so we didn’t bother getting any more “free” breakfast. I have stay at other Homewood suites and this is nothing to the standard I was expecting.
