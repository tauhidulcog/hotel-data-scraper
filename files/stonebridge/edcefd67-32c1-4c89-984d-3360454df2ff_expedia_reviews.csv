Clean room Staff beyond good ,10,LUCIA,2025-10-06
"We traveled to Colorado to see Sleep Token at the Ball arena. We liked that the hotel was only an average of a 20-30 minute drive to the arena and downtown area! The rooms were very clean and the beds were the most comfortable beds we have slept in by far! Between the comfy beds and black out shades in the room, we got the best sleep of our life. The hotel is in an overall great location and we enjoyed our experienced! ",10,Elissa,2025-10-05

"Excellent service! Wonderful breakfast!!!
Comfortable bed! 
Bathroom not good! Single tiny lav. No place to set anything! 
Shower curtain a foot short! 
No instructions on remote to lower or raise the two window shades! ",8,Mary,2025-09-29
Staff did everything possible to accommodate us. Matthew took great care of us and made us feel welcomed!! Special shout out to him. Breakfast was awesome ,10,Daysy,2025-09-28
"I paid over $300 for one night at the hotel. They charge for parking which, I think, is ridiculous. It’s not in the heart of the city, and there were many available spots. For $300 parking should be included. ",8,Terry,2025-09-27

Clean room And great stafg,10,Thomas,2025-09-23
"Biggest issue was noise. Poor sound insulation to the point where I could hear the person in the next room snoring and people talking and moving around in other rooms as well. I don't believe the other people were being overly loud, it's just the property seems to have no sound insulation. Shower was also disappointing with low pressure. ",4,Douglas,2025-09-21

A+++ property all around.  Stayed here on several occasions.,10,Randy,2025-09-18
"Staff was friendly, room was clean, bed was super cozy. 

Only reason for the lower rating is that this hotel is so poorly constructed that I could literally hear every single movement and footstep of the neighbors above, below, and next to me. My bed would literally shake with every footstep as I was trying to fall asleep. I will likely never stay here again for that reason alone. ",6,Sarah,2025-09-17

"We checked in and the internet was down, so they had us write our cc info on paper sheets. I shared my safety concerns about having our cc info on papers at the front desk and the women checking us in did not respond. Later, we came down and there were a stack of papers with people’s cc info sitting unsecured on the front desk, not even behind the counter, but out where anyone could easily take a pic. The woman working only moved them behind the desk when I said something.",4,akilah,2025-09-13

"A brand new hotel. The faucet came off in the shower. Put me in a room that smelled like dogs in the room on top floor. Manager came and changed our room out. I saw the cleaning lady just spray air freshener in room. Now it is clean! I love dogs, out I am allergic to dogs! I do not understand the poor quality of a new hotel. Manager was  nice and correct the issue. Holiday Inn do better!!!!",4,June,2025-09-04

"The property is located 10 miles from downtown Denver and 3 miles from Denver Airport. The property has no food serve on site so food options are limited to other hotel or fast food locations. Parking is charged thru a separate parking service. 
In general the property ok for a quick stop over but not much else.  ",4,Joseph,2025-08-31

"Decent hotel. Difficult finding the shuttle bus at the airport as all hotels come to same spot. Hundreds of people waiting and then pushing to get on the bus.
Hotel itself was decent. Reasonable shower. Bathroom not in great condition. Continental self serve breakfast was ok. Large quiet room.",10,Ziva,2025-08-27
"The property is mediocre at best.  Of the 3 shuttle drivers we experienced, only one was a good driver and that was the young white guy.  He drove safely and I didn't feel like throwing up by the time we got to DIA.  ",6,Theresa M.,2025-08-24

I arrived in Denver very late and was happy to have a clean and safe location close to the airport,10,Jeff,2025-08-23
The hotel was close to airport. They offered transportation to and from airport. Breakfast great a lot of options.  The only problem we had was finding the transportation from airport to hotel.  Called 3 different number to find out where to be picked . Then the van was labeled Double Tree not Holiday Inn Express.  Gentalman walked down street with homade sign wirh three different hotels written on it.,10,Sharon,2025-08-23

"Matthew checked us on and he wonderful! The room was clean and well equipped with amenities such as Dove products with plenty of towels. There is a refrigerator and very clean microwave. The bed was soft but firm enough for a good nap and night sleep. The room didn't have a smell of cleaning chemicals or freshner. The breakfast could stand a little tweeking such as better cooked omelets and biscuits. There are quite a few other selections though, even some I have not seen before. There is not a coffee maker in the room but there is a great ground to order autolated machine in the breakfast area thats available 24 hoirs a day. I will definitely book the Holiday Inn at the Denver Airport again! It's so quiet!",10,Kathy,2025-08-10

The room was a bit run down. The bed and pillows were not super comfy. The noise during sleeping hours was awful. Doors slamming for 20/30 minutes straight. Loud TV from the room next door.

The process to pay for parking is not smooth or simple.  It is tedious and creates a negative impression from the beginning.  Just charge more for the room.  I was unable to use AMEX because the app wouldn’t allow all of the account digits to be added.,6,Randall,2025-08-03

"Charisse was unwelcoming and unhelpful, even when I wanted to pay for an upgrade or pay to stay for late checkout. It’s not that it wasn’t available, it was that she didn’t want to be inconvenienced. The tub was dirty and had some stains so I didn’t want to use it. There’s no dining other than breakfast but two of the breakfast machines weren’t working. Everything was simply mediocre. Except the bed…the bed was very comfortable. ",4,Mallory,2025-06-03

The hotel was centered in a good location. The breakfast selection was good and very tasty; and I liked the fact that they provided to-go containers and bags. I also liked the fact that the hotel had a laundry area, just in case one wanted to wash and dry their clothes.  
Overall,  my son and I enjoyed our stay,  and would definitely recommend this hotel to others. ",10,NICOLE,2025-05-05

The staff was terrible we waited to be checked in for 10-15 mins when she finally checked us in she was very rude my son was getting surgery and we didn’t know if we booked enough nights so I asked if needed to extend my stay how I could do that and she was rude about it. Next day another staff member was rude about us asking a question about a pool. Was never greeted and overall just not impressed by this stay. Also the bathroom had hair all over and put no effort to make it look decent and like if it were cleaned. ,4,Brittany,2025-05-04

"Room was large and clean.  It was not clear to me when booking that there would be a $16 parking fee, which I found out about last minute, and had never seen at a Holiday Inn Express before.  This made my good price not so good.  I'll need to be more careful in the future, as that small difference could pay for a slight upgrade in accomodations elsewhere.",8,Scott,2025-03-17

"Whenever I have a flight cancellation at DIA, I choose a hotel on Tower Road. I chose the Holiday Inn Express for ground transportation and breakfast options.  It's quite clean and recent-ish construction.  IT went downhill from there. 
When I asked the front desk for a toothbrush and toothpaste (as a result of not having my luggage), the attendant provided them begrudgingly. 
This is the 3rd IHG hotel in 3 weeks that also didn't have a channel list for the tv and no channel menu option on the remote.
The wifi wouldn’t stay connected - they sent a tech who verified.  I was told other people in the hotel weren't having 'my problem'.  
In the evening when making up the bed, one of the pillows had a small bloodstain on the bottom. Thankfully no bedbugs.
Then I woke up about 2:45 because the adjacent room's TV was blaring.  I called the front desk, they sent up a person who tried to hear the noise from the hallway.  The tvs are placed at the farthest distance from the room entry doors. He couldn't hear it, and I was told, they would not ‘disturb a customer to turn the volume down.’. When I told them I was a customer being disturbed, they said I could mention it to the front desk crew in the morning. 
Totally disappointing.

"We're Canadian and had an overnight layover in Denver. We missed our shuttle as we didn't really know how to navigate the airport (we are not travellers) and a shuttle for a nearby hotel very kindly dropped us off at our stay :) 

Check in was nice. The staff working that night was incredibly pleasant to deal with. Our room was spacious for our family of 4, everything was clean and tidy, and the continental breakfast was great 😊

"In an effort apparently to safe paper, there were no glasses or cups for drinking and no coffee pot in the room.  One then had to ask for them.  

Also the TV remote did not work.  It needed batteries. 
 When we asked, were told to come down and get them, but we were already in pj's and asked them to bring them up.  But we had to call a second time before they arrived.  One would think that the cleaning staff should always check to see that the remotes are operational.  Apparently not.  The only soap and lotion were in push jars on the walls.  No separate facial soap, no shower caps.  In short, the amenities were rather poor.
However, the morning breakfast included was quite good; lots of choices.  ",8,Patricia,2025-02-25

"It’s really convenient after a long flight to hop in the shuttle to just go to the hotel. The shuttle is easy to spot as they provide instructions on how to find the shuttle through calling the hotel number. The only downside I would say is the distance from the airport, it took about 30 minutes to get to the hotel from the airport and if you’re really tired this might be an issue. For me it wasn’t though, I think the cleanliness and convenience of the hotel makes that one downside irrelevant. Overall, a nice place to stay and would definitely recommend. ",10,Renee,2025-01-26

"Very poorly designed in as much as internal noise.  Room entry doors require considerable care to close quietly, most people didn’t notice or care regardless of time of day or night, sounded like cell doors from a B movie.  The rooms cross transmit other noise such as anything short of very light tiptoeing it’s like mall parking lot with every other car a mobile boom-box.  Staff started vacuuming before 8 AM which shouldn’t be a problem unless you are kept up all night and as was the case, but again the facility design just echoed and amplified what would normally be tolerable.  The staff working in the halls were obviously not aware of the issue as there seemed to be no concern to speak at a reasonable level.  This was easily a 4-5 star unit but for the sleepless night.  Nice complimentary breakfast, accommodating staff, clean and pleasantly priced. We spent two weeks on the road during this trip, and honestly the noise issues were not normal.",4,M,2024-10-26

"We have been long time guest at Holiday Inn Express before our early morning flights to Florida, but recently the staff have been rather unwelcoming and one morning we had no hot water to shower. The front desk staff told me that was normal when every guest showered at the same time first thing in the morning. Really? not an issue at every other resort I've stayed at EVER. The last straw was the parking fee, we have one more booked in Dec that is non refundable but all of our 2025 trips will be at a different hotel for before flight stays. ",6,Mellisa,2024-09-25

Had some problems with the handicap shower leaking water all over the floor in the bathroom and out into the little hall area, we had no curtains on our windows just a blind that did not go all the way to the bottom of the window. Did not like that because we were on the first floor and everyone walking by could see in our room. I took our extra pillows and blocked it so no one could see in. ",6,Laura,2024-07-04

Walked in the front to check in and not a hello, or a thank you for staying with us. She went straight to ‘ ID and credit card’ in a very unfriendly tone. When inquired about why the service was so bad, (didn’t even bother to tell us where our room was, where the elevator was, etc.) we got a repetitive ‘Thank you for staying’ in the most sarcastic tone, with the never ending bad facial and body attitude by both the employee and her supervisor.

Needed a place close to the airport for an early morning flight back home and happened to pick this place and so glad I did. It was a complete 5 star hotel that was perfect for a quick over night. Then I was blown away by a large hot and cold breakfast waiting for us downstairs at 6am. The shuttle bus was right on time to drop us at the airport. I highly recommend this place.,10,Jeffrey,2024-02-28

"Everyone who we interacted with was so kind and helpful! However, this place could use a lot of love. Bathroom was very dirty and had a thick layer of dust on the poorly painted shelves. Towels had some black stains on them. The lobby bathroom was disgusting too. The toilet was clogged, there was urine everywhere. 

We stayed one night to stay close to the airport for an early morning flight. Would never stay again just based solely on the cleanliness. 

Also, thin walls, we could hear people all night long hollering and stomping. 

The people who work here were all so friendly and welcoming. It is just the state of the place that needs help. ",4,Verified traveler,2024-01-07

 me wonderful directions to the airport to drop off my rental car so I could avoid paying the hotel parking fee but they didn't tell me when I got back that I needed to sign up for the shuttle in the morning and consequently had to take a taxi in the morning because they were too stupid to know that I needed to know that,4,Thomas,2024-01-03

One knock against this place was the overnight parking fee. One last positive was the wonderful Christmas decor in the lobby.,10,Nathaniel,2023-12-30
We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality and comfort easily rivaling a four star hotel and will definitely stay again. Close to Denver International airport with a shuttle. Unfortunately we arrived on a midnight flight and even though we were told by a hotel clerk when calling ahead that it would be no problem as the shuttle could be used up until 1:30 am by contacting the hotel this was incorrect info as the shuttle runs every half hour until 2345. The Uber ride was about $40. all this was frustrating at such a late arrival but everything else was so pleasant and easy we were still overall very satisfied.,8,Gregg,2023-12-29

Young lady at the front desk Sunday morning was pleasant and informative with the shuttle information, breakfast had a great selection of hot items and was kept fresh and full. 

After getting stuck in Denver after missing our connecting flight, it was such a relief to check into this hotel and have a comfortable and clean room for me and my daughter. ",10,Gemma,2023-09-05

"The property was clean and well maintained. This was positive. 
Our room was ready so YAY for that. 
A friend and I were heading home from a retreat. We were exhausted. She had a sprained ankle. I use a cane due to arthritis in both feet. 
We had taken a Mountain Carrier from our venue in Granby CO to the Denver airport. Our plan was to take the hotel shuttle to the HI.
We were dropped on the wrong side of this huge unfamiliar airport. 
I called the HI 8 times (plus my friend called 3 times) and we could not get a person to help us with zthe shuttle. 
Eventually, we grabbed an Uber and arrived at the hotel. 

We both had luggage and are over 60, AND have mobility issues. Our Uber driver actually ran in to find us a luggage cart, seeing how hot, sweaty, limping, dehydrated and exhausted we were. No carts. 
So we lugged everything in.

No one was at the desk. The two young ladies were hiding in a side room. When they emerged so we could check in, one was clearly annoyed for being tasked with helping a few guests. 
I asked for a luggage cart, explaining how exhausted we were. She simply said, ""I guess they are all in use.""
No offer to find one.
I mentioned I had called many times for help.
She was snippy and asked, ""Are you. sure you called the right number?"" Caroline. Dont patronize your guests. 
Her rudeness caught me so offguard, I added angry to my list of challenges. 
I wish we had stayed next door at a different hotel. I am done with HI. ",6,JILL,2023-08-15
