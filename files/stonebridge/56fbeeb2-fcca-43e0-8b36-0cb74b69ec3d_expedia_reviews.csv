Nice area but very overpriced ,8,Kristin,2025-09-29
"We had a pleasant stay at this hotel. Sadly we didn't have a nice view of the mountains even though we booked a corner room on the 4th floor, but of buildings. Given that it isn't located in a city centre, the fact that you could only park outside free for a couple of hours, and had to pay $25 each night in the underground garage seemed expensive.",8,Alexander,2025-09-06
Very nice hotel. Bar looked fun but I was tired/Ill so I spent most of time in bed.,10,James,2025-09-03

"Arrived and room was extremely hot.  Turned down ac and left, came back to a room well over 80 degrees.  Called front desk, maintenance was sent ~45 mins later, said it was fixed and would cool within 5-10 mins.  Stayed another 15 still 80+ degrees.  Asked for a refund, was told it would be approved, was declined.  Total crap.",2,Josh,2025-06-23
The hotel was very convenient to where we were vising. The room was excellent,10,Donald,2025-06-23
"Despite the hotel SPECIFICALLY noting (in at least 2 separate places) that cats are allowed, and us mentioning at the time of booking that we were traveling with a pet, after a 7 hour drive we were turned away when we arrived with our cat. We informed both the reception staff member and manager that in their Hotels.com profile they specifically list cats as being allowed, however we were informed that regardless of the misinformation no exceptions would be made. The staff did not offer any assistance in finding us a last-minute pet-friendly alternative hotel.  Since the issue was 100% the hotel's fault, we felt more should have been done to either accommodate us at the hotel or to assist us in finding an alternate hotel.  Even when traveling without our pet we would never stay here due to the extremely poor management and customer service.  ",2,Michael,2025-06-14
Okay property.,8,Satish,2025-06-07
"The property is in a good location however the hotel didn’t meet our expectations. We were traveling for a family of 4 and booked a 1-bedroom executive corner suite. This was not as described instead we were in a room with a half wall(no door). The morning shift personnel Jeff was also ill informed and was unfamiliar with the Marriott application and how it worked specifically with the electronic keys, was unfriendly, terse and insensitive to my kid’s disability as they relate to a service dog and continued to press on asking for details of my kids disabilities.",4,Rowena,2025-05-29
"The property was nice, well kept and modern. The fitness center was great, my only gripe was that the floors in our room were very dirty. I walked around barefoot after taking a shower and actually had to wash my feet again before putting my socks and shoes on. Clearly they hadnt been cleaned in a long time. I would have expected better in a Marriott like this one. ",8,Justin,2025-05-26

They charged me $25 for parking- total rip off and that was not stated in the reservation. I also believed that the reservation included breakfast and there’s no record. No perks for the Expedia platinum member either. ,2,Melissa,2025-05-07

"I liked the overall feel and look of the hotel. Staff were so pleasant and courteous. Even when the fire alarm malfunctioned. It certainly wasn't their fault and nothing they could have done to prevent it. 
It was also convenient for me to walk to the university everyday for my meetings. I would stay here again.
Thank you ",8,Heather,2025-04-03

"The only issue we had was when we wanted to use the pool the lights in the room would not work. We thought it was a bit unsafe, but we may do anyway. It was Christmas time and we were full of good cheer.",8,Steven,2025-03-07

"This was a wonderful place to stay during Christmas week. Four generations of our family met at the hotel to ""snack and swim."" Unfortunately, some/all(?) of the lights in the pool room didn't work. It wasn't a major problem as everyone had fun regardless. The room was wonderful, the property was well-kept, and the staff was personable and professional. While I can't remember his name, our bartender on duty during our stay was fantastic!

"Very nice area, safe, walkable to some shops and sprouts. Short drive to downtown. 
Staff super friendly. We thought the $25 park fee per night was a bit much, but we were told that we could find parking in the street (a block away) which we did, since we felt we were in a super safe area. No regrets. Will definitely stay again. Boulder is beautiful and so was this hotel. ",10,wanessa,2025-01-03
Great location in the center of Boulder.  ,10,Renee,2025-01-03

"The staff was great. My only complaint is they have a massive parking lot that they only allow their guests to park in for 2hrs. Otherwise you are required to valet with them in their garage for $19. 
So, their parking lot is fully empty by the evening because they force their guests to valet in their garage and pay a fee. Seems like a way to price gauge their guests. Nothing is more irritating to see an empty hotel parking lot and paying $19 daily to park in their garage. ",8,Nicholas,2024-09-10

"Got there at 4, expected check in was at 4. wasn't able to get in a room until 6. Was fresh off a few 14er hikes, 0 sleep, and very tired, so this frustrated me. The staff was very friendly though, the lady at the front desk was sweet and very apologetic. However, overall put a stain on the stay.",2,Wells,2024-09-03

"We were here for bolder Boulder Race, perfect location near start & finish (roughly under a mile so it’s perfect for warmup and cooldown) love the proximity to restaurants walking distance and shopping. Hotel itself is clean. If you are Marriott member the bonus is getting free breakfast and coffee etc in M club. Highly recommend ",10,Larry,2024-05-27
"Awesome facility, however, it takes more than a facility to make a visitors visit wonderful, it takes staff, such as Mr. Blake Dubrow, Guest Services Manager, who went out of his way to welcome us. Keep him on board.",10,Stuart,2024-05-21

Overall it was good.  Comfortable beds clean room.  I thought it was BS that they charged you 25.00 a night for parking. The room was 271.00 which is not cheap so I thought them not including parking was lame. ,8,Kristen,2024-04-25

"About 5-8 minute drive to the university. Very clean, modern room. Four great pillows on each bed, very comfy. There’s breakfast buffet ($20) in the morning. Adjacent to shopping areas - very convenient. Underground parking is available but tight & awkward ($25/night) ",10,anika,2024-04-19

"What you are not told after you make a non-refundable reservation is that the hotel is under major renovation.  Unrelated to the renovation, neither elevator is working so the service elevator is the only option which aside from being very grundgy has nowhere near the capacity needed. For what they charge a night I’d say hard pass",4,David,2023-08-27
"Please stay somewhere else.  Booked our room with no mention of major construction on the website. We paid top dollar due to college move in wknd and the place is a mess. This is not minor renovations, the hotel id going through major renovations. Only one elevator working causing huge delays to simply move about in the hotel. Plus the extra charge parking garage is awkward to begin with plus they never activated our room key at check which is how you access the garage. Luckily there were some garage attendants that bypassed the system for us. Overall very disappointed based on the service and amenities that are provided for the price that was paid.  Please don’t get ripped off.",2,Patricia,2023-08-21

"The entire staff was amazing! They were attentive and helpful at every opportunity. Assisted with every task and were fun and happy and a blast to chat with. From finding middle of the night microwaves and plates to helping AAA with a dead rental car battery so we could stick to our plans, everyone smiled and helped and were genuinely happy to do so. Rooms are nice, have a beautiful view. Need a few repairs- loose towel racks, key card plates and loose toilet paper holders but well worth it for the helpful staff. Great location for any CU activities as well!",10,Stephanie,2023-04-29

"The hotel accommodations, location & cleanliness was perfect....but the security is questionable. The room next door to us had loud music, slamming doors and numerous people streaming in & out from 12:30 a.m. to 3:30 am! We tried to call down to the front desk, but the phone in our room was dead. Once we called on our cell phone & politely asked them to address the problem, we were told that they could move ""us"" to another room! Really?!  Very disappointing since it is a really ideal hotel.",6,Verified traveler,2023-03-13

"The laundry machines were out of service and the AC in our room did not work. Luckily it was cold enough outside and we had a door we could open.

Yes, the property looks very modern and the people are nice. However, the issues with amenities and the fact that Marriott nickel and dimes you for everything from parking to wifi detracts from the experience.",6,Alexander,2023-01-21
