Place is outdated, needs a refresh.

"I stayed 6 days in Denver and it was great. The room was spacious, clean with good amenities. 

The laundry room was great but missing a board or table to fold the laundry. 

Complimentary breakfast was very good as well as the dining area and lobby.

The staff was friendly and helpful.

Our stay was okay. Although had we had known the hot tub was out of order we probably would have booked elsewhere. Beds were comfy and customer service was good. Breakfast was your typical hotel breakfast. ,8,Christal,2025-08-19
"Good location. Ran out of Kleenex and toilet paper- 3 people in a room! Had to chase down person to get some. Went to breakfast, was locked out of room at 9:00 before 12:00 check out. Tub was not clean. Fake eyelashes!!!! On floor and got stuck to our feet.",6,Nancy,2025-08-18

"A lot of homeless around the area and I had a weird experience with a person in the lobby she was making a mess where the coffee and water was and she was not all there and acting weird she just told me sorry I am a resident here and left her mess there and got on the elevator.
Our bed was like a taco sunken in the middle.
Also one of the lobby person was so rude and impolite twice we created when we walked out the hotel and no answer ",8,Ramon,2025-08-11

Pros: The continental breakfast had a large selection and the area was kept clean.  The room was very nice and clean.  The bathroom had a tub and shower.  The exercise room was very clean and had what I needed to do a little work to feel good after driving for 9 hours. ",10,William,2025-08-01

We were charged for a night that had been paid in advance.  We were assured twice that it had been credited back and taken care of.  Then saw the charge on our credit card and now have to dispute it.  Very disappointed!,2,Verified traveler,2025-07-09
"What a bummer! I booked the Fairfield because I thought it would be a better stay, more comfortable beds, etc. I booked 2 queens for my family if 4, but when we checked in, they didn’t have any left. Gave us a King with a pullout couch in the tiniest room I’ve stayed in that wasn’t in Europe! Just not a great experience. Has to shimmy by the pullout bed to user the bathroom. The pullout was not good mattress needed to be replaced. ",6,Melissa,2025-07-08

Everything was fine. The only little problem is that once the sofa bed is extended there is about twelve inches clearance to walk around it. ,10,David,2025-07-02
"We stayed at the Fairfield Inn for 3 nights. Overall our stay was decent with just a few inconveniences. We initially booked a king bed room, the mattress was completely worn out and caved in, we were either trying to sleep uphill or rolled into the middle on top.of each other. The desk staff were very helpful and found us a two queen room to finish our stay. We did run into a few snags with that room, the fridge quit working and the sink drain was slow draining. They promptly fixed the fridge for us. The rooms were clean. The breakfast was adequate with choices of eggs, bacon/sausage, muffins/bagels, cereals, yogurt,  oatmeal, and waffles. The juices were watered down but the coffee was good. The location worked well for us too for visiting family and going to Coors field and Empower Stadium. I would stay here again.",8,Nicole,2025-06-29

"Horrible experience! We arrived at 2:30 on a Sunday and was unable to check-in until exactly 3:00 p.m. Once we got to the rooms the beds were horrible. The mattress looked like a bowl. We had two rooms and they were both exactly the same. We were able to change rooms but the staff was not helpful at all. We asked for recommendations for places to eat and they didn't have any suggestions or any lists/flyers to assist us. The next morning we went down for breakfast and that was a nightmare. Coffee was cold, scrambled eggs standing in water, no oatmeal, no waffle batter, no yogurt and the bananas and oranges were moldy. We told staff about the issues and left to eat elsewhere. This was the same for the whole week we were there. The bathrooms on the first floor outside the pool and exercise room were never clean and did not have soap, toilet tissue or paper towels. I can understand a bad day...but a whole week of the same even when staff knew about the issues is UNACCEPTABLE!!!!  This was my first stay at a Fairfield Inn & Suite and it will be my LAST!!!!!",2,Verified traveler,2025-06-23

"It was just ok. There was no room service everyday. The room key was not good and we had to try 5-10 times with the key to get inside our room, bad experience. And on one of four nights we stayed, the room door was open when we came back from outside to our room, the cleaners didn't lock our room door after cleaning and left it unlocked for anyone to get inside our room leaving our valuables in the room at risk. No bathroom soap refill after couple of days stay. No trash pick up last two days.",6,Verified traveler,2025-05-21

"Hotel seemed clean throughout. Came downstairs for breakfast right at cut off time and was told it was closed. Found staff delivery of this information to be extra rude. After more than 4500 miles of travel this was the only complaint I have had about service anywhere we stayed. Evening check-in service was strange as well, had to wait for someone and there was no staff manning the desk the rest of the evening. ",6,Lindsey,2025-05-17

"It ain't the Ritz, but it ain't Motel 6. This is a GREAT area. 20 minutes outside of Denver and there are GREAT places to eat nearby. Check-in was easy. Rooms are standard. Pretty clean and comfortable. Good channels on the cable. 

Pool and jacuzzi were nice. they have a gym as well.

Breakfast was simply eggs and weirdly thin bacon.

Lots of parking although many potholes so be careful during snow/rain 

Overall, it did the trick for about a c-note a night.",10,MATTHEW,2025-04-07

"This two-night stay was part of a longer family vacation and we chose not to extend our dates at this particular hotel due to the limited breakfast options and the cold swimming pool. There might be some polar plunge folks out there who enjoy a colder pool, but my kids were not fans. 
On the bright side, the beds were comfy and it was easy to get to and from shopping and downtown Denver.",8,Verified traveler,2025-03-29
"Staff was very friendly and helpful, especially when I had a late check in. Nate was awesome. Only area of improvement I would suggest would be the breakfast offering.

"Their machine to make keys broke, they would pay to get one sent next day (Per manager). You had to be escorted to the room every time you walked in because the manager didnt want to spend almost 200 to get the machine expedited. This is what the maintanence manager told me. The manager was very rude to my and only when i called bonvoy he rudely asked me if i wanted a refund for the nights that  i had left on my reservation. Then he was basically asking me to get the refund and go somewhere else. The receptionist was initially fine during the checkin then she was full blown on a panic attack when the machine to make they keys broke. Making the situation very uncomfortable. Then she got rude and dismissive when i requested to speak with a manager, she said he was busy on a call. Afterwards when she thought i had left to my room i heard her and the manager talking about him leaving before i got back to ask for him. After talking to him and leaving exause he also got rude they started making fun of me and the situation. Will never stay at a marriott again. Never had anything like this disrespect anywhere else.

Great employees.  There are homeless in the area and signs in the parking lot that say not responsible for vehicle damage and stolen property.  This is a problem all around Denver after 20 years of democrat leadership.  There's a lack of law enforcement and sanctuary cities invite these issues. ,10,Brandon,2024-10-13

"Hotel is rather clean and pool looks very inviting. The only downside I noticed is that on more than one occasion, there were people coming in from outside the hotel that were not guests to take advantage of the breakfast service. The staff either never notices or does very little to prevent it. A simple/innocent room key verification at the breakfast area implemented for 2 weeks could fix that problem. ",8,Kevin,2024-10-12

Traveling to Denver to get my son set up in college. We stayed 2 nights my wife and I. I reserved a King room but at check in none was available so we got a queen room. When I first got into the room I noticed that one of the drawers was open. I closed the drawer but it opened again. It would not stay closed. There is no way they did not know this was a problem but rented the room anyways. I informed the front desk in the morning because it was pretty late when we checked in and just wanted to go to bed. The front desk did move us to a king room which was bigger but had issues as well. The bathroom door handle was barely hanging on. It did not even work. The toilet did not flush well. Had to flush several times in order to get completion. The breakfast was very ordinary and did not have the waffle maker just scrabbled eggs and bacon or sausage. For the price I paid for the room I expected a lot more. The service was great but short staffed for all the things they had to deal with. It is very apparent that this property is not maintained well and they need to do better. ,6,BRENT,2024-08-19

"The facility and surrounding area's were littered with garbage. 
Homeless sleeping all around the hotel. 
We found trash under the bed from previous occupants. 
We found ants in the bed in the morning. 
The bed was sunken in on one side. 
The ac unit was so loud that you could not hear the TV. 
When I spoke to the front desk in the morning I was told because I booked through the Orbitz website they could not offer any refunds for the room. He took my info and said a manger would call me. No one called. 
Do not book this hotel. ",2,Roni,2024-08-18

"The hotel was in pretty good condition. The carpet in the room was newish. The bathroom was okay, it was clean and the water pressure great. They could have added more amenities like a shower cap. The a/c was very noisy. No safe in the rooms. The breakfast was good. Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, breads, yogurt, oatmeal, two types of cereal, milk and great coffee that was available at all times. The rooms had a small coffee maker but we never used it. The trash outside the lobby was full a lot. The staff was friendly enough. Lots of restaurants and grocery stores nearby. Easy access to the expressway. I would stay again. ",8,Susana Ruiz,2024-07-01

"The Fairfield Inn was clean, comfortable, and a very good place to stay. I would have given it five stars. Unfortunately, though, Fairfield Inn moved me over to the Super 8 across the street for the first of the two nights. The cigarette smell in that supposed non-smoking Super 8 room was horrendous. I have asthma and felt like I could barely breathe the entire night and the next day. An outdoor tent would have been great compared to Super 8. Disgusting.....",6,Verified traveler,2024-06-01

"Overall nice stay but highly disappointed in the breakfast. Excepted a nice, hot breakfast,  each morning - only to find that within an hour of breakfast starting on both days,  they ran out of hot food - with no indication that more was being prepared.  Just discouraging when you book a hotel that claims to have breakfast but the only available items are breads,  cereals, and yogurt.  Wasnt worth the price. ",8,Stephanie,2024-05-30

Coffee machine with coffee and microwave in the room with functioning iron and ironing board. Room was clean, bed was comfortable, the entire booking/stay process was easy. They even incorporated Marriots ""free fresh baked cookies"" in the evening policy. Free continental style breakfast in the morning starting at 6am weekdays and 7am weekends. Great location right off the highway with plenty of stores and restaurants within 5min drive time. Area felt safe and was well lit. Hotel was perfectly in the middle between Denver and our destination of Boulder for a graduation.  Overall, my wife and I were extremely satistified with our stay.

"We've stayed at the Fairfield Inn numerous times and I was a bit disappointed in the breakfast options and availability.  On Saturday when I went down approximately 45 minutes after the start of breakfast... most everything was minimally stocked.  There were no plates, only one or two pastries, a couple slices of bread, and some hard boiled eggs. 

The gal working the breakfast area finally brought out some breakfast sandwiches and I watched some teenage boys grab a few and they both spit it out saying it was disgusting... not sure what offended them, but I wasn't willing to try it.

When my grandson and his friend (both hearty eaters) came down there was only 2 small boxes of cereal and only one container of milk.  

If ""breakfast"" is part of the room fee, I would anticipate a better stocked pantry WITHOUT a petulant worker who was put out anytime anyone asked about an item that SHOULD have been readily available.",8,Chrisy,2024-04-30
