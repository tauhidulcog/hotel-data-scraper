Room was very clean and beds where very comfortable staff where great no problems inside the hotel but outside wasn’t very clean there was a lot of homeless on the street outside of the hotel ,10,Sean,2025-09-23
"We had a pleasant stay at this hotel. The rooms were very comfortable, clean, and well-kept, and the staff were consistently friendly and helpful, making us feel welcome from the start. Service overall was excellent, which made our time here enjoyable.

The only downside is the location. The hotel is right beside a harm reduction center, so there are often people struggling with substance use gathered outside. At times, this meant seeing individuals sleeping on the street or openly using, which can feel unsettling. While the hotel itself is great, the surroundings may not be ideal for everyone. That being said, the hotel has great security and we never felt unsafe.",10,Charlotte,2025-09-23
Staff upon check in was very. Clean but small rooms. Overpriced but I guess NY is expensive. ,8,Sonia,2025-09-23

The hotel was convenient to Times Square within walking distance and many dining restaurants. The hotel was near many shops. Parking is a short walk from the hotel entrance for an additional cost.

All staff professional and accommodating. The outside area was a bit shady. Homeless people close by and their areas were very dirty. As a general statement the city is pretty dirty. Despite this comment, we love NYC and will return again and again!",8,Beth,2025-09-02

"We had a wonderful stay at the Courtyard Manhattan Times Square West! The hotel was very modern, spotless, and had a warm, welcoming atmosphere from the moment we arrived.

Katherine Garcia checked us in and was absolutely fantastic – quick, friendly, and very informative, which made the process smooth and stress-free. Crystal was always cheerful and welcoming whenever we passed through the lobby, which made us feel right at home. A special mention also goes to Aaron Whitening, the bell attendant, who greeted us with a warm smile every day. He went above and beyond by helping us store our bags and even arranging our car service to the airport.

Overall, the service, cleanliness, and hospitality were outstanding. We felt truly cared for during our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York City – it’s a perfect choice!",10,Carly,2025-08-29

"Unfortunately, my stay was disappointing. The area around the hotel felt unsafe, with many loiterers and ongoing construction that made the street even more uncomfortable. The room itself was very small and not worth the price. Check-in was supposed to be at 4:00 PM, but our room wasn’t ready until 4:30 PM, so we had to wait around despite arriving on time. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend staying here unless the location and conditions improve significantly.",6,Mun,2025-07-30

If you stayed past the 9th floor, you had to come from the higher floors to get ice. Also, no vending machining on the floors and you had to come down to the lobby to use the microwave.

Loved the fact that it had a place downstairs to grab snack and coffee. Amazing gym and even had a laundry room for guests to use. Highly recommend.

"The hotel room was acceptable for the area. We stayed for 4 days. We asked for housekeeping each day, but had to call one day to get some supplies. We drove to the hotel and the staff was not very helpful about directing us to where we were supposed to park. When we left, they weren’t sure about where we were supposed to go to pick up our car. They should be a little more informed about this. We ate breakfast there one morning and it was not good. Over toasted dry bagel with a little container of cream cheese and the avocado toast was not the best. 
Angel, who works at the front desk, was very nice and helpful. However, we would not stay here again.",6,Beth,2025-07-14
"LOCATION !!

walkable distance to times square 10 mins , 10 mins to Macy's , you need your room card to get into the lobby at the hotel which give safe to the customer .  ",10,Mileydis,2025-07-14
"Stayed here two years ago and was disappointed this time how rundown the area is outside the hotel.  There is a large group of homeless people living right outside the hotel.  The Penn Station area is just not nicest anymore.  We will not return because of this. 

Rooms are very small and elevators run slow. Would not recommend unless price is the only factor you are considering. ",6,Cathy,2025-07-13

"As instalações do Hotel são boas, quarto moderno e limpo.  A localização é perto da Times Square, mas o entorno é péssimo: moradores de ruas, usuários de droga, prostituição; Isso gera uma sensação de insegurança muito grande; Não recomendo para famílias com crianças, porque vi situações de pessoas se drogando e até mesmo o segurança do hotel expulsando uma pessoa que estava agachada para defecar na frente do hotel. Claro que o hotel não tem absoluto controle sobre seu entorno, mas pelo preço, há melhores opções em lugares mais seguros - o custo benefício foi ruim;",6,Marcio,2025-07-12

When we shared this with the hotel staff, they said they are aware of the health issue, but that they couldn’t give us any clean water to drink or clean our teeth, and instead we should wait for the free ice they supply to melt. This is very poor service, so be aware and bring your own water. 

The location is good in that it’s close to Times Square but still far enough away to not have as much noise. The rooms are quite small compared to others across the country but it seems most hotel rooms are small in New York. ",2,Jacinta,2025-06-21

Also no refrigerator or microwave for a week was ridiculous. The bed was extremely rickety and uncomfortable. It felt like it was going to fall apart when we climbed in and the mattress was thin with bad pillows. We stayed at a lot of hotels on our trip and this was by far the worst! Some of those rooms were under $100 and this was over $250! Worst hotel bed ever! The staff were very nice but we will never be back. We need to sleep and function in the room.

I’m personally a little upset with the property there are things in the rooms that look nothing like what the website says and I even went to the front desk to see if I could upgrade due to the stuff I had with me and I was told that the website hasn’t been updated and that’s the best room they had.

Welcome when arriving was disappointing- Geoffrey checked us in - not very friendly- felt like we were an inconvenience so we stayed away from reception after that & found out things on our own.

"Excellent Stay in the Heart of Times Square!

I recently stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Times Square, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish.

The location is unbeatable—just steps away from the energy and excitement of Times Square, yet the hotel itself offered a calm and quiet retreat from the bustling city. It was the perfect base for exploring nearby attractions like Broadway theaters, Bryant Park, and the subway for easy travel around Manhattan.

The room was clean, modern, and well-maintained, with comfortable bedding and thoughtful amenities that made my stay relaxing. I appreciated the in-room coffee maker and a mini fridge. 

The staff were outstanding—friendly, professional, and always ready to assist. Whether it was providing dining recommendations, directions, or ensuring a smooth check-in and check-out, they went above and beyond.

I also enjoyed the convenience of the on-site bistro for a quick breakfast and coffee before heading out.

If I had to note anything for improvement, it would be to provide more chairs. But overall, my experience was flawless, and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for comfort, convenience, and excellent service. ",10,JENNY,2024-12-31

"This hotel is in a great location for sightseeing and concerts. I stayed 2 nights, and was able to get everywhere easily. Lots of food options around. The room was a double so quite comfortable for 2 people. Beds were firm, which I like but my son does not. Can't expect the hotel to have a mattress firmness for your particular taste. The rooms and hotel in general look as if it were recently renovated, since the bathroom fixtures were pristine, and the furniture didn't have a single scratch or dent.  Hallways in this hotel were very narrow. My room was on the 8th floor, so if noise from below bothers you, get a high floor. NYC is never quiet! The staff here were wonderful, especially Gyselle who arranged a car to JFK for me.  But everyone was super professional and lovely to deal with. Food at the bistro is a bit pricey, but nothing in NYC is cheap so take your pick. There's plenty of places to eat around.",10,Nicole,2024-11-06
Staff and manager Aaron were fantastic. Our only complaint was lack of hot water for showers - it was warm but not hot. Everything else was fantastic! ,8,Erin,2024-11-06

"I had high expectations for my stay at Courtyard, but unfortunately, the room fell short of what was advertised. The room was much smaller than the photos suggested, as I was making my reservation the room I chose had a living room area and nice city view.   When I brought this to the attention of the staff, they were polite but unable to provide a solution. While the hotel had a great location, the lack of comfort made it hard to enjoy the stay. I would recommend that the hotel update their online descriptions to better match the actual rooms, as this would prevent future guests from feeling let down.",6,Jose,2024-10-02
"Crystal was excellent - we turned up early & she found us a room big enough for our luggage. Room was clean & modern. We require decaf coffee so asked reception to sort out for us on day 1 - it arrived eventually! On day 2 we had to ask again - after an hour it didn’t appear so we told reception we were going out for coffee. When we returned hours later it was in the room. Considering the price of the hotel the service was poor.
Whilst the hotel was excellent directly you stepped outside you felt unsafe. There were numerous down & outs and addicts. Once we saw an addict syringing into his foot.",8,Christopher,2024-10-02

However, Crystal at the front desk went above and beyond by letting us check in early, which was a lifesaver for our tired group. This small gesture made a huge difference in our day and set the tone for a great stay.

On our last day, Steven, another team member, really stood out. He was attentive, friendly, and kept the positive energy up. He even took the time to interact with my nephews, which added a personal touch to our experience.

"Don’t let the price make the decision to stay here!  The entire room is smaller than my bedroom at home.  As soon as you open the door, the corner of the bed is right there.  You can hardly open the door without hitting the bed.  Also, after a long day of sightseeing, I was looking forward to a goodnights sleep, which is impossible to get because the mattress on the bed felt like concrete.  I don’t think I’ve ever laid on a bed this hard in my life and certainly not for over $400.  The bathroom was tiny and didn’t have a walk in shower.  The old cast iron tub shower combo was not what I was expecting from a “newly remodeled” hotel in NYC.  Spend the extra money and stay with Hilton.  ",4,Melinda,2024-08-31

The facilities were beautiful, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was excellent. the soundproofing between rooms could be improved. There was an anime convention going on and some of them were very excited about it… And we could hear all about it in our room, which is the only downside. ",10,Christina,2024-08-27

The room was spacipus for a NYC hotel and we could barely hear any of the hustle and bustle from outside! Made for great nights of sleep! (Mind you we were on the 24th floor, so that helped)
Will be booking this hotel again for my next stay in the city!

Sad the hotel doesn't offer complimentary breakfast. :(
Special thank you to Katherine, Jeffrey and Crystal who made sure that we got a large room and received all our packages. Thank you also to the tall African-American man who helped me with my laundry in the basement and sweeps the common areas on the ground floor.

The staff were very professional, helpful and friendly. I was very happy with our experience. It is a family friendly hotel and can't stress enough on how clean the room was and also the hotel. The location is good,  but outside the hotel there are a lot of homeless and druggies, just have to be extra careful at night besides that I can only say positive things about our stay as a family of 3. .

"The hotel has everything you need, great service, nice staff, clean, comfortable and new rooms, but unfortunately is not in a great area. I wouldn’t call it unsafe, just not the best neighborhood vibe. The streets are dirty, where the garbage is piled high and smells terrible at times, there are some unsavory people around but nothing too bad. Just need to be prepared. A very nice hotel in a slightly busy and crappy area near the Garden and the Port Authority. Good way to save some money but still have a nice clean room! There’s a Starbucks inside for a paid breakfast and you feel plenty safe in the lobby. ",10,Daniel,2024-08-13

Location is a little sketchy, but that’s pretty much the case everywhere in this part of Manhattan but I never felt unsafe. Sadly, since the pandemic ended, many homeless people who were housed in hotels just got dumped back on the street with nowhere to go, so you will find them around the place, but this doesn’t reflect on the hotel, just on the general state of welfare in the USA.

"I only landed , so just needed a comfortable bed for one night to rest before I venture for my other journeys. Staff were rather friendly, and thank you so much to ladies who kept and hold done to my glove which I accidently left. Good location. Plus option to leave language for few hours is really good and allowing guest to change phone and rest for a bit in the cafe - so thank you. 

The only suprise was a deposit - I am from Europe and Hotels website didn't specify how much I have to pay additional. This should really be included in the overal price. It's been now 16 days - over two weeks from my journey and deposit was still not return to me. Smooth process with deposit return would have made for a better experience. Two other hotels I stayed in after already return me deposit. ",8,Barbara,2023-11-26

It's generally not a safe area, especially the ""health facility"" nearby for drug addicts.. However, doors are locked and heavily staffed hotel and need key to access elevator floors and rooms...

"A fire alarm was set off when we were in bed one night.  The entire building was evacuated.  Not one staff member took charge.  All the occupants were across the road and not one staff member took the initiative to come across and let the occupants know when to come back into their rooms.  The only reason we knew it was safe to re-enter is because the fire brigade trucks left the scene.  We were in our rooms not even one hour and the fire alarm activated again.  This time we did not leave as it only sounded for a couple of minutes.  The fire alarm went off again around 2am and sounded for a minute.  No explanation was given to the occupants.  No apologies for any of the disturbances. A total lack of consideration for the occupants.  I would never stay at this hotel again because if there was a real fire, there was no person in charge or even seen to be doing anything to assist the occupants. 
There are homeless squatting in the alcove right next to the hotel and each day I witnessed homeless peeing and defecating right next to the building. I know it is not the hotel's fault but that is what you need to pass through to get to the front of the hotel. ",4,Brigitte,2023-08-23

Decent size room and in good condition..had bright modern bathroom.

Close to theatres and Times Square, subways etc..all within a 5-15 minute walk.

"37th street has easy access to the theater district, 5th avenue, Penn station, the High Line.  Hop on a subway (2 blocks away) and you are all over New York.  It was a busy place without the craziness of the Avenues.",10,LAURA,2023-06-03
"It was practically the first time we visited New York city so we wanted to find a place close to everything. And indeed, this hotel is conveniently located a few blocks away from 34th Penn station and Times Square/Broadway. What we didn't realize was that 37th street was a bit unsafe. It's only 1/4 of a block from the busy 8th avenue, but that little stretch (maybe just 1 minute walking distance) was a bit dark and unclean. The hotel room was spacious, the beds were clean and comfortable.  However, you have to keep the curtain closed at all time, otherwise you look right into the office building across the street (maybe this is standard for hotels in Manhattan). Staff were friendly and courteous.  Overall, it was a very pleasant stay with reasonable price (for Manhattan). ",6,REIKO,2023-06-03
"O chuveiro poderia ter água com mais pressão e volume e o ar condicionado era extremamente barulhento. Fora isso, tudo excelente principalmente o atendimento. A velocidade dos elevadores também é incrível, sempre tem algum disponível e super rápido.",8,Gustavo,2023-06-02

"We had a wonderful stay. The entire property was clean and welcoming. Nice lobby, staff were great and housekeeping was really good. They cleaned the room every second day during our 5 night trip. Very quiet rooms, short walk to Penn station and Times Square. We had a king bed room, a little small but expected for New York. Nice bathroom. We also booked way in advance and their rates were really good for the location. Chose this hotel after some research and I can see why it has a high rating across all hotel/review sites online. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay here again. ",10,Melissa,2023-06-01

"We really enjoyed our stay at this property and would love to stay again sometime. The staff was helpful and friendly, really pleased with their team.  This property is a great value for those looking to be close to everything without breaking the bank. We walked to Time Square, Empire State Building, Carnegie Hall and Central Park all in under 20 minutes. It could improve on the amenities and offer a breakfast, they only have a high priced Starbucks that is rarely open. Overall it's a decent, clean and accessible location to enjoy Midtown Manhattan and most of NYC.",8,Dennis,2023-05-29

"This hotel is not recommended enough!  

-Centrally located at 37th & 8th but yet not right in the busy part of Times Square.  It's a short walk to two different subway lines, close to Times Square, restaurants and shopping, etc.  I've stayed closer to Times Square and it was very loud at all times of the night, but not at this hotel.  We slept well every single night. 

-Extremely clean hotel, which is of utmost importance to me.  The room was spotless as well as the property in general. 

-I also felt very safe given that we had to tap our room card to even enter the hotel.  Some prior reviews mentioned the clinic next door being problematic so I was a bit concerned but it was totally fine and we had no issues.  

-Staff were very friendly and helpful.   

-We tried the restaurant on the last day for breakfast.  Very yummy and a great option.  It's open a few hours each morning.

-Gym is open 24 hours, we did use it a few times.  It was clean and well equipped.

If you are looking for a simple hotel that is clean, centrally located and good value for what you pay, this is definitely a great hotel.  We will stay again!",10,Cathy,2023-05-29
"The Courtyard NY Manhattan/Times Square is an ok place to stay if you are able to swing a good price.

"The hotel itself is well run, clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful. One feels very safe once through the doors (locked later in the day and you can't get in without your key). The area has seen a real downturn in the past few years as there are many homeless living on the streets and close by on 8th Avenue.  The hotel itself is situated in a very good location though to get to some lovely restaurants, shop and see plays/musicals on Broadway.     ",8,Susanne,2023-05-16

Will stay again next time I’m in NYC.

"The people at the hotel were very helpful and friendly.  Unfortunately it was very hard to get cabs in the neighborhood.  I realize that with maid service only every other day things are hard and when they did come they did a lovely job, but two people in a room for 48 hours of trash and showers was not really top drawer.  Also the breakfast was not great.  No gluten-free options except oatmeal, all paper with no plates, even paper plates, made eating eggs and other items unpleasant.  I believe kitchen is being renovated so perhaps that will improve but even a buffet would have been better.  ",8,Katherine,2023-04-25

Lol) They could have more towels in the room especially when it's more than 2 people in one room, also a microwave would be a nice touch. Not complaining just an idea.

My family and I stayed for 3 nights and was so impresssed! It was clean and the staff always greeted no matter how many times we were in and out.  The location is several blocks from Penn Station so it was super convenient because we took the train in from Newark and easy getting back out too.  And being that close to the subway gave us easy subway access to other areas.  It is also walkable distance to Times Square and there are so many eateries around the area that it was hard to choose where we were going to go!  Loved everything about our stay.  I would not even look for another hotel the next time we are there.  I’ve been to other hotels and it’s hit and miss even when you’re paying more.  ,10,Kimberly,2023-04-06

"Hôtel choisi pour un bon tarif. Première fois dans cette hôtel mais 20ieme fois à NY.
Pour l'emplacement c'est tt à fait correct, pas loin de Times Square et à qques pas du MSG et Penn Station.
L'arrivée c'est fait sans problème et rapidement avec un étage haut ( 25 sur 27) mais malheureusement aucune vue car en cour arrière...
Le gros bémol est la taille de la chambre qui est trop petite et pas rafraichi...on est encore dans les années 90-2000 avec les meubles imposants en bois foncé ce qui réduit considérablement l'espace et la sensation d'être confiné...
La VMC dans la partie sanitaire est méga bruyante comme un super aspirateur puissant non stop ce qui est bien dérangeant la nuit tt comme le petit frigo bien efficace même si tt petit mais qui fait lui aussi un bruit de dingue....on l'a déplacé et on a bien réduit la puissance...
La salle de bain est très propre de ce côté rien à dire...juste le manque de pression.
