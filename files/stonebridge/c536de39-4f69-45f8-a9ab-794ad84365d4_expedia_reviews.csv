Loud drag racing on Washington late at night. Area feels unsafe,2,Julie,2025-09-23
"I don’t even know where to begin on this review. Upon checking in the front desk charged our credit card for our stay and it had already been paid for. They stated they were running my card for incidentals, but charged my card for our two nights and the incidentals. That was eventually fixed after contacting Expedia. Our room was not great. There was mold all over the ceiling in the bathroom and the furnace that was readily accessible in the room filter was probably not changed for years.  The breakfast in the morning was just vile. Our room faced the street and I can’t even tell you how loud it was. We were on the sixth floor. It sounded like our window was open and we were on the first floor. We also did not get maid service while we were gone the entire day. Called down for towels at 11 PM and they told me to come get them myself.",4,Ben,2025-09-22
Stayed here a few times over the years. Always well maintained with good service. ,10,Rich,2025-09-21
Fantastic place downtown food around the corner was wonderful. The rooms are very well decorated even though they had kind of an old-school feel and the place is built very well.,10,Matthew,2025-09-20

"The staff was friendly and so helpful. The building was beautiful and has an amazing history! Although the parking wasn't at the actual property, it was easy to get to. The breakfast was lovely and we had an overall great stay!",10,Kayli,2025-09-06
I paid for my parking. The spots are limited and drivers sometimes take up more than one spot. Ended up scratching my car trying to squeeze in. There is carpet in the fitness center which is odd. You can text the staff for assistance which was nice. Breakfast is nice,6,STEPHANIE,2025-09-05
The fact that we had to shlep our bags fromthe garage arou d the corner ,10,Patricia,2025-09-05
The room was run down and not maintained well.,4,Jacob,2025-09-04
"The hotel is a little outdated, especially the carpets, but it's nice and clean. The room was pretty good. The beds were very soft. The tv was huge but didn't have many channels. We couldn't close the curtains so it was quite bright at night. Breakfast was quite good. The staff was nice and helpful. ",8,Chantel,2025-09-01
The elevator was very dirty with worn out carpet.  The room did not feel very clean. I understand it is a budget hotel but it need to be kept up much better.  Will not stay there again,6,Wolfgang,2025-08-31
The room was a little cramped.,8,Karla,2025-08-30
"The property was good, but had some problems. One was only one entrance. Second was the remote location of parking. I am disabled and the distance wzs a real problem. Hampton Inns and Hilton could easily afford a driver and a golf cart for transportation to the garage, at a minimum for handicapped. 
The two front desk personnel, Sharon and Maria were two of the best I have had the pleasure of dealing with at any facility.",8,John,2025-08-30

Great place to stay. Close to lots of useful places!,10,Kellon,2025-08-12
"The service was fantastic but the inconveniences outweighed that heavily. I have stayed in a lot of hotels and never had to pay for parking or $75 for incidentals? That makes no sense! There is no pool so you have to walk a few blocks to use another hotel’s pool. The pool is not heated! I wouldn’t even go in past my feet- ice cold! The hot tub was warm barely. The parking lot was not close by and totally inconvenient. The wallpaper was peeling and the view was awful. Everything else was nice though. The breakfast was good. The woman at the front desk was super helpful and kind though! Wish I could remember her name! Thank you for your help and kindness. With all the cons, would not stay here again. ",4,Anna,2025-08-11

"We purchased the room and within minutes are informed that there is no parking except the customary Hilton fee of $10. We are then told you have to park on the street in the loading zone to check in. When I get there, the road is not big enough for me to get out of the car to go in. I have to wait. We check in, and riding the elevator, I wonder if we will make it to the top. We get out to the smell of mildew and very hot. The room was ok. The bathroom had peeling paint and peeling wall paper. The shower head was a cheap waterpik head that was plastic and old. Once showered you could see the marks from previous years of mildew on the wallpaper and on the ceiling. There is no fan for proper ventilation. 
I went to get ice and when there, smelled the most putrid smell of sewage or something.

I was not impressed for staying in a Hilton. Yet again the Hilton name has failed me. Lipstick on a pig.",6,Verified traveler,2025-08-02
Room was a little dirty but staff was very attentive. I would highly recommend this hotel. ,10,Tod,2025-08-01
"The staff were great, the breakfast very typical and clean. But the road noise was terrible.  Absolutely not the fault of the hotel- but the road its on is the ""cruising"" strip.  Literal drag races at 2 am. So many revving cars and motorcycles we slept terrible. (My house is on a main road and I'm used to car noise. This was on another level of loud). Even though the staff and hotel its self were fine, i would not stay here again. (Unless they get soundproof windows). ",6,Amber,2025-07-27

"I would not recommend staying here unless you’re there for a conference or very VERY short stay.
Our entire stay, included a stay with 200+ cheerleaders preteens-teens and they were noisy and not at all controlled
Breakfast: not a lot of options honestly and was the same over and over again in different variations.
Parking, not connected to the hotel. You either have to have a free pass limited or like 10 people, or pay daily for a parking garage. We did not have good luck, as the conference center that’s attached took the entire parking garage on multiple occasions.
Or you have to park on the street which is very VERY limited. It’s not at all convenient nor the safest with the homeless around that area. 

Housecleaning was great, and most of the front staff was great but they have a lot going on it seems and couldn’t remember simple requests.

Most likely won’t stay again, but it wasn’t the worst or the best. 

Also only had one elevator working at the time, and with as many guests that they had was not quick and taking the stairs every time to the 6-8th floor is not the most convenient.

They allow pets BUT be prepared to not have a pet area anywhere near by unless you walk down the street a way from the hotel and into the park. Not quick if they need to go then and now. ",4,Jordan,2025-07-15

Room was smaller than expected. The noise from the street was terrible. I was woken throughout the night by sounds from cars and sirens.,4,Alia,2025-07-07
"The property is nice and well located, and the breakfast was very nice,  but we were on an outside room and, even on the 7th floor, it was so loud with traffic noise it was difficult to get to sleep. Also, the curtains would not close, so the room was extremely light all night. ",8,Richard,2025-07-06
,10,Dayle,2025-07-06
"The room and service were good. There was significant noise from the street below, which made it tough to sleep. Also, the breakfast offerings were not impressive. And lastly, the fact that we had to walk about a block to our parking space was frustrating since we had to PAY for it.",8,Wesley,2025-06-30

We was not able to check into my room upon arrival at 4pm and waited around until we were almost late for a concert.  Very inconvenient as we had to leave our stuff in the lobby and back at our car.  ,4,Shane,2025-06-30
We tried to,2,Betsy,2025-06-30
"Parking is $10 a day and garage is not connected to Hotel, you have to walk half a block. 
Staff was friendly, no problems checking in/out. Breakfast buffet was clean and well staffed. Our room was directly across from the elevators and they are old and loud so we could hear every time someone used them well into the night. Room doors also are heavy and slamming late through the night. We were on the Washington Street side, which turns into somewhat of a local drag after dark.  Cars with loud music, sirens, and lots of motorcycle groups kept us awake until about 2am. 
We stayed in a weekend. We asked to be moved to a quieter room but they were sold out. 
Probably won't stay at this location again. We prefer a quieter place to stay. ",6,Ayisha,2025-06-29

"This is a city hotel that was okay generally, but it has inadequate parking.",6,Thomas,2025-06-02
"I won't stay here again.   MOST of the staff were wonderful, and the bed was comfortable, but a) check in was horrible.   The staffer seemed VERY put out to be checking me into the hotel.   Extremely off-putting.  b) Poor hotel security.   I can't remember the last time I stayed at a hotel where a room key was not needed to use the elevator?   No elevator restrictions at this hotel, and, the front desk was OFTEN unstaffed, meaning, anyone walk in off the street, and can get into and use the elevators.    I did always double lock my room door? but the lack of hotel security was unpleasant.   Finally -- and I realize the hotel itself can't control who checks in -- drunken guests fighting in the hallway disturbed my sleep.  Maybe I should have called local police?   I did report disturbance to front desk, twice.   I believe front desk intervened?  but guests continued to be disruptive, for more than two hours.   Not helpful for a good night's rest.

"This hotel is located on the corner of downtown and while peaceful during the day. At night time all to local kids with super loud exhaust systems cruise around the hotel and surrounding city blocks reeving up their engines a making so much noise, this goes on from Nightfall thru around 2:30 am so it's really hard to sleep. The city of Ogden does nothing to curtail this activity. ",2,Cindy,2025-05-27

Smelled like rotten garbage disposal but no soap for me to run through the sink.   Tried to contact front desk and no answer.  Room is very dark.  Windows are blocked so no light.

"Was not impressed that the parking for the holel was a parking garage behind the hotel on the otherside of the block with no access to the hotel had to walk around the block. Also not impressed that they did not mention the filled in their pool. Told us if we wanted to swim we had to walk down to their other hotel the hilton garden 2 blocks down. Was very upset as we chose this hotel based off it having a pool and being close to the Egyptian theater. If we had know about the pool we wouod have just got a room at the Hilton Garden instead

Check in was ok - top floor with a bath tub-so excited since I’d been driving all day. NO HOT WATER! Waited till morning still NO HOT WATER! Said their boiler was down. Would have been nice to know before spending well over $100 for literally just a bed. No courtesy call, no compensation….just good luck and on our way. Never again. ",2,Misty,2025-01-16

There was an aromatherapy machine similar to a Halloween fog machine on the desk pumping pine scent into the air. I’m assuming it was supposed to be on for just a few minutes but could have been running for 5 hours and the smell was overpowering. We ended up changing rooms late at night because the smell had not dissipated after five hours. ,4,Michael,2024-12-21

Parking required that you walk trough a dark ally around the block to the hotel.  I had to leave at a very early hour and it was a bit disconcerting.  My room had HVAC that was going on and off all night - very noisy and the street noise was very disruptive as well.  There was confusion about my reservation and I was called in the middle of the day and informed I had 10 minutes to get my belongings cleared.  I finally was able to speak to a manager and the issue was resolved but I had discussed the reservation on my arrival at length.  Not sure why the front desk waited until the end of my stay to advise about the problem,4,Merleta,2024-12-08

"Te hotel and staff were average. We stayed on a Saturday night, which included loud street racing until about 3 am. The parking is about 2 blocks away. Loading and unloading is by the front door on an extremely busy street in yellow zones. The rooms were extremely small. Elevator access doors is about 36 inches, making it very difficult to transport items. I do not recommend for pets. You must walk a couple of blocks for a relief area. Overall, I do not recommend this property. ",4,Donna,2024-10-23

An absolute horrible stay! No hot water and no heat on a freezing cold night. Absolutely unacceptable.,2,Kim,2024-03-11
"WORST PLACE EVER!!  HORRIBLE!  NO HOT WATER and NO HEAT!  THE HEATER NEVER WORKED!

The hot water was out for the entire day and NIGHT!  The heater NEVER WORKED.  So we basically froze the entire time.  We had a maintenance person come to our room.  They explained since the hotel was fully booked and everyone was using the heater and water, that we would NOT have any hot water or heat!  Sounds like they are connected to one broiler.  This was THE WORST hotel experience I have ever!  When I spoke to the front desk person, she kept telling us, it would work in a few hours.  That went on ALL DAY every day!  I understand tproblems, but they never addressed it or fixed the issue.  They blamed it on the building being old!  If that is the case, they need to put a warning label on this hotel stating, ""YOU WILL FREEZE.  We do not have hot water or heat""  There were multiple people complaining.  However, the front desk person could NOT do anything to help us.  The only person that could help us only works Monday to Friday.  They need to have someone who is in charge over the weekends too.  This is not acceptable.  I will NEVER EVER stay here again!",2,Kim,2024-03-11

Our stay was good.  The hotel had issues on our first night with no hot water but they worked super hard and had it fixed the next morning so we got hot showers.  The staff was amazing very friendly and helpful.

I didn't see a breakfast host to clean tables or to keep things stocked. They only had 1 type of coffee, dark. 
This is the first time, I've ever been to a Hampton inn that breakfast was disappointing. Will I return to this Hampton, probably not. Parking was terrible too. Hotel parking area was so close that I took 3 tries to park. I had to squeeze into my parking lot.",6,Genevieve,2024-03-10

A very unique Hampton inn with a lot of charm along with modern conveniences. The front desk girl was extremely welcoming and made sure that I was registered as a Hampton inn VIP for a future stays. The neighborhood is walkable and so many great food choices,10,Julie,2023-10-21

"The off site parking is a bit of a hassle for the guest. There is also the question of security for our car.. fortunately we didn’t have any problem.. then to charge $6 for that experience seems silly. 
It seemed maybe whatever remodels they did was lipstick on a pig. Just the one of manny, Torn carpets in the elevators that make maneuvering those wacky luggage  carts impossible. We won’t come back ",6,Verified traveler,2023-10-12

"The staff was really friendly and the breakfast was great both days. The location is ok, there is a parking garage right around the corner. Decent location next to a lot of food and entertainment options. But also next to some pretty loud and busy roads.  The hotel and building are very old, and it shows in some ways. But overall they keep it pretty clean anyways. ",8,Aaron,2023-09-24

"I was traveling with my severely disabled mother.  We booked the handicap room.  It had luxurious beds, a large bathroom and lots of grab bars!  Thankfully we brought both Mom's walker and a wheelchair.  She couldn't have done it without the wheelchair as there was a hike to the room and to breakfast from the room.  the walk would've done her in.  I was impressed with the number of grab bars in the tub/shower but the only way my Mother could've used it is if they also provided a stool to sit on.  The small parking garage is disconnected and also quite a hike (for a disabled person) to the entrance.  Thankfully, we were allowed to park in the loading zone once we got situated.  Everything was wonderful...the compassionate staff, the accommodations, the breakfast.  I would definitely stay here again.",10,Donna,2023-08-05

"The staff at this hotel was fantastic.  They were attentive, efficient, and friendly.  The property was not what was advertised on the listing when I chose the hotel.  The pictures showed much larger rooms.  The room we got was small and the carpet in the rooms and hallways was really old. The elevator was really old as well, and was unsettling to ride in.  It was small and made a lot of noise. Also, there is no on-site parking. The hotel has street parking for loading/unloading and you have to park in a garage around the back of the hotel.
