The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was larger than the photos on line. The gym was one of the best I’ve ever worked out for a hotel. Dumbbells go up to 75 lbs. The hotel was also dog friendly. Definitely recommend.,10,James,2025-09-27
Room was great. The fenced yard for the dog is a plus +,10,Elix,2025-09-25
"Was pleasantly surprised with a very modern Hotel. The room was incredibly spacious and clean and comfortable! Loved my stay. Free breakfast in the morning was presented well, good coffee and so many options in a very well thought out space that could accommodate a lot of people.. did not feel crowded what so ever. Very nice. I can see why people would want long term stays here!",10,Michelle,2025-09-24

"From the moment Jeanine greeted us and allowed us to check in early to when we checked out, we had a wonderful stay.  Our room was clean and quiet.  I was initially worried that our room overlooked what I think was the kitchen ventilation system, but we did not hear any noise from it.  While not the nicest view, we were able to check in early and get a good start on our day (you have to take what you can get when checking in a noon).  The room had a fully equipped kitchen which we made good use of.   The included breakfast was fabulous!  There were so many options and some of the best bacon I've had in a long time that was cooked to perfection.  They also had vegetarian options.  The coffee was delicious and always available and always hot.  Location is terrific if planning on going to Lewes and Rehoboth beaches. We'll definitely be staying here the next time we come to the area.  ",10,Carolyn,2025-09-16

"Hotel was nice, but stayed two nights and one day without any housekeeping help. Also at checkout the desk clerk was rude was speaking to daughter and having private conversation on speaker at the same checking is out and asking us questions. Actual hotel set is beautiful, stocked with needs, and breakfast was hot and ready on time. ",6,Tony,2025-09-15

Aerosol spray was everywhere and isn’t needed the pool was opaque and the same items were on the floor two days in a row. The staff were friendly and the room was clean but the sheets and blankets were polyester. I thought Hilton prides themselves on a comfy bed. There is nothing comfy about polyester. ,6,Cheri,2025-09-15

"The room was not ready at 3,, so I went to Starbucks and came back an hour and 1/2 later and the room was still not ready . Then she asked if we would like to move to another room and I said is it the same and she did not know then finally she looked and said yes it's the same and I said that's fine . And then they told her that we wanted it on a different credit card and she's still charged my credit card. Then we had to wait for the hot water to get done and when I asked she said oh I had it done over 20 minutes ago ",8,Luanne E,2025-09-08

"It was very clean and the suite was comfortable.  Front desk was very kind and helpful. Pool was nice. Only complaint was breakfast.  Waffles tasted sour, factory scrambled eggs and some sausage shaped meat product with a strange texture.  Hard boiled eggs were good.  Bread products were ok. It was included in suite price.  I won't eat there next time but everything else was excellent.  I will definitely stay here again. ",10,Richard,2025-09-07
"Always have a wonderful experience with staying at this hotel. Love the location, the rooms, the lobby, the breakfast, the gym, the pool, the staff and the walkability to everything!",10,Scott,2025-09-07
"This was one of the best Hiltons I have probably ever stayed in. The location is great, just about a 10 min drive to downtown Lewes and 15 mins to Dewey beach. 

The free breakfast was also above average with food options. I enjoyed the complimentary coffee, tea and water stations that were available 24/7. Parking was also free and ample, it's a large lot with plenty of spaces. The rooms were also very clean and the kitchenette was a nice bonus I wasn't expecting. I did not hear any road noise either.

I will definitely stay here again the next time I visit the DE beaches!",10,Stephanie,2025-09-06

The breakfast has many varieties to choose from. The room was spacious and clean. The only thing I wish different was the bed was too soft for me, but that's a personal preference.

"Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 teens) stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights. The room we booked was spacious for us- beds were clean and comfy, bathroom and kitchen was clean. The room overall was clean and comfortable for us. I find the curtain partition between the beds and the sofa bed very convenient. We needed to cook our meal for our son so we had to request a hot plate/hot stove and pan from front desk. Breakfast was the usual hotel buffet breakfast, varied and a lot of choices. Loved the complimentary coffee and fruit infused water, as well as water bottles in the lobby. Overall comfortable stay for our little family getaway!",10,HEBERT,2025-08-14

The breakfast area was not set up all that efficiently. Breakfast was good but everyone wants a waffle and for those that don’t…..it’s a hot mess. Make a separate waffle area. People are frustrating and inconsiderate of others. You  n can’t help that at all I know.,10,Debra,2025-08-11

Clean facilities with unmatched comfort choices, from their free water selection to the lobby market that even had quality treat options for both cats and dogs, they truly make you feel at home.

"We were in DE to view properties and brought our dogs with us. I picked this dog friendly hotel not knowing anything about it - well, it was a GREAT choice because of the effort made to accommodate dogs, from a gift on arrival to the places available to walk them and even a small fenced area where they could be off leash. I really appreciated this because our pups are our family, as is the case with so many pet owners. Our room was very clean as was the hotel as a whole. Customer care was very good.

"Very nice hotel! Fruit infused water, coffee, tea and hot chocolate available 24/7.  Breakfast had many options and I was impressed that they offered gluten free items for my daughter who has celiac disease.  Staff was friendly and very willing to help with anything we needed.  We had a handicapped room for my Mom and it was extremely spacious.  My only complaint (which staff can’t do anything about) is that whomever designed the building, put the handicapped rooms farthest away from the elevator. It was difficult for my Mom to walk that far, even with her rollator.  Maybe hotel should have a wheelchair guests could use while in hotel.
Beds were comfortable, pillows could be better.  Convenient location. This our 2nd stay here and will definitely stay again.",10,Kim,2025-02-09

"I was there for a soccer tournament. I originally stayed one night in another hotel with a similar price but I it was so dirty I couldn’t finish my stay there. I booked the 2nd night of my stay here and I picked this hotel because the reviews were very good and cleanliness was included. It did not fail. Immediately upon entering you could see the hotel was clean, it smelled clean, looked clean and was bright. They offered complimentary waters and chocolates upon arrival as well as a complimentary coffee/tea/hot chocolate bar available 24 hours which was much needed after being out in the cold watching sports all day. Our room was labeled a atudio but was rather large and included a full size fridge, dishwasher, microwave, utensils and cups/ plates. The room was very clean and comfortable as well. The breakfast included eggs, waffles, cereals, breads and pastries and the eating area was very clean. It turned my weekend around from terrible to wonderful. ",10,Carina,2025-01-26

"I rented one of the largest suites for 3 people through Expedia.  All 3 of us came home with BEDBUG BITES on our body. I have tried most unsuccessfully to get an intelligent person on Expedia or at Hilton to address our concerns.  The trash towels and sheets were not changed when we were there.  We did not get clean towels until 5:00 pm on the 2nd day.  We had to leave the dirty towels in the hallway as well as the trash which they asked we keep in the suite.  Obviously, both beds, the linens, and the pull-out sofa had bedbugs.  Our bites were on the arm, elbow, bottom of the face, and stomach on all 3.  This is ridiculous for an alleged 4 yr old property let alone not being able to get attention to this matter at Expedia or the hotel.  The hotel keeps you on hold forever and I have hung up after 10 minutes.

"Our first impression when we arrived that afternoon was of the guy at the front desk. Very personable, energetic and gave us what turned out to be a fantastic restaurant suggestion. Our rooms were very nice and having an actual freezer was a nice bonus. My only complaints are small, but I'm mentioning anyway. The matress was too hard for my liking. I noticed a bit of pink slime mold in the shower corners and in the shower door track. Again, it was a small amount, but still grossed me out. Mom was psyched to see the walk-in shower, but I slipped a bit in mine and she felt there weren't enough grab bars for her to shower safely. And lastly, my toilet seat was mounted crooked onto the toilet. It was a bit uncomfortable and unnerving. Other than that it was a great place to stay. We're already looking for things to do down there so we can cone back.",10,Sharon,2024-09-22

The location was convenient, pizza place was walking distance, gasoline station, Japanese restaurant and it’s so accessible to the main coastal hiway to shops, the beach and restaurants. But you won’t hear anything at night, so quiet. 

The hotel itself is amazingly clean, rooms are clean, spacious and updated. Coffee, juice, hot water/tea/ hot chocolate area were always attended to and refilled. There were free snacks. water and for pets too (snacks and water for dogs). The breakfast was really good as well. I will definitely stay here on our next visit. Didn’t mind the room

"The hotel was very nice. But actually finding it was very difficult. It doesn’t face a street and just sort of sits in the middle of a parking lot that is poorly marked and has a confusing layout. The signage for the hotel is on a marquee with several stores and restaurants. Not immediately recognizable and hard to spot while driving. There needs to be a serious re-design of the parking and a dedicated approach needs to be laid out. Lots of families and groups staying there. That is to be expected due to the proximity to a beachside resort town. Just a little noisy in the hallways in the evening and at night, also in the early morning. The breakfast was fine, just a little bit on disarray after unsupervised children made a mess of the set up. The staff was friendly and accommodating. ",8,Robert,2024-06-17

The things that might turn some people off, but didn't bother me, are that they only clean the rooms every other day, and that it's a short drive to the downtown beach and boardwalk area.  I'd imagine that during the summer it must be pretty hard to find parking down there, so staying at a hotel that's a short walk to the beach might make more sense for a lot of people.",10,Michael,2024-04-10

Beds were very comfy and the room had great space with fridge, full size microwave and even a dishwasher!

"Front desk staff on Saturday evening were rude, dismissive, and accepted no responsibility or solution to my problem. There was ZERO internet. While my WiFi was logged into the Hilton Honors WiFi, there was no Internet. The moment I stepped outside to the parking lot, it worked, but not within the hotel. The Front Desk member was not helpful and arrogant and didn't seem to care about my issue nor offer any suggestions.

The other two significant issues... we were given a handicap room with a shower that leaked all over the bathroom and the kitchen. It wasn't worth it to switch, but we weren't able to take showers.

Finally, while the key worked for our door, the door handle was jammed and wouldn't open. Took a lot of back and forth with the hotel.",4,Verified traveler,2024-03-26

"Hotel is becoming a bit dated and the service has gone down substantially.  It seemed like they were struggling to get revenue and so actually charged to check in an hour and a half early despite the room being ready at the slow time of year  in the middle of winter at the beach.  Pets are welcome but the walls are thin and you can hear dogs barking late into the night.  Feels like the whole place could use a good deep cleaning.  Breakfast selections were decent, but could use more healthy options.  ",6,Verified traveler,2024-02-12

Aside from that minor quibble, the staff was good. The facility and rooms were clean. The 'per friendly' environment was great for us and our Golden Retriever. The included breakfast was REALLY good! (Belgian waffles, breakfast sandwiches, and omelets on a 'continental' breakfast were very nice to see!) The location was convenient for getting to and from the Lewes and Rehoboth beach areas... although a car ride to both was necessary. (... and, in the last week of August, the traffic wasn't bad!)

"I usually love to stay at this property. One of the main reasons is the pool, where I swim daily. This time the pool was unexpectedly not being heated the whole week of my stay, and the water temperature was too cold to swim. I asked about this in the middle of my stay and was told that they were waiting for a part for the heater. I suppose that can't be helped, but it was disappointing nonetheless. ",6,Yvonne,2023-08-28

"The area itself is fine, it is not a ""quaint"" part of Lewes if that is what you are after. It is in the middle of business commercial shopping, restaurant and retail. The entrance is not quickly recognizable, yet very convenient to Rte 1and Rte 9 on the outskirts of the town. 
Well lit and busy area though I could not hear a thing from my room overlooking the parking lot and adjacent to Nicolas Pizza (which is a plus for good family food). Traveling alone, I stayed for the convenience. The building itself I found to be well maintained, my room (studio set-up with kitchenette) was spotless and stocked to the rafters with towels and washcloths which I found to be a bit funny.
 My only complaint would be that my bed was adequate but not the most comfortable. 
Breakfast was ok with the usual pre-prepared fare eggs, waffles fruit and good coffee. I passed on the food though, because negotiating around other guests with kids was a  challenge and one gentleman (no doubt the alpha provider) cleaned out the fruit bowl and baked goods preparing for a zombie apocalypse with all he could carry from the buffet...gotta love people. Plenty of options nearby if you need to shop around. One caveat, the place is popular with dog owners.
