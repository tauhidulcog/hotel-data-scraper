"The stay was very good, but 2 things popped up that takes a star away. The in-room coffee maker had no directions and deep down a Keurig K-Cup would have been a better choice (kind of idiot proof). The mattress was almost unsleepable (I see this as a valid word, but spell check is not happy - sigh). I can see why you could not have a room full of different densities, but maybe a Sleep Number might work for a high ended hotel. My old back needed a firmer choice and for some reason the King seemed a tad small - maybe my perception.  Ok 2 more (on a roll) you need a 2nd hook in the bathroom for towel hanging if you don't want to change out towels daily. And lastly - is 1 ply TP/tissues really a top choice for a 4-star establishment? ",8,Scott,2025-09-29

"Hard to park and find a road that was not blocked by window washers, staff almost non existent except for very nice housekeeping, some kind of repairs in lobby, smelly elevators, room was ok. ",6,Angela,2025-08-18
"So, the hotel is centrally located in the heart of Montclair. Whatever cuisine you could ponder is less than a 20 min ride from the hotel. Staff was amazing. Housekeeping was at our room no later than 12pm each day of our stay. Definitely would recommend this hotel. ",10,LEONARD,2025-08-14

"I called reception to request a baby crib and was told someone would follow up. No one did. When I called again, I was told housekeeping had left and reception couldn’t access a crib.

I ended up spending an uncomfortable night sharing a queen bed with my toddler. A baby crib is a basic amenity that should be readily available, especially at a hotel of this level.

Disappointed with the lack of coordination.

"If you need to be in Montclair, this is the place to stay. I wish there were a suite option but my family of four usually just takes two queen beds. The restaurant downstairs is fine but it'll get tedious if you eat there everyday. The hotel is in downtown Montclair so you'll have plenty of food and entertainment options around. There's a club upstairs but we didn't get to it.",10,Eyal,2024-12-01

"The hotel offers a pleasant, clean, and comfortable environment, though there were a few aspects that caused some inconvenience. The placement of electrical outlets in the room was not ideal for charging devices; notably, there were no USB ports available, and I found it challenging to connect my laptop at the desk due to the absence of a nearby outlet.

Additionally, because the room featured a thick carpet I encountered difficulty with the office-style chair at the desk, which lacked wheels. This made it cumbersome to move the chair, and I experienced some frustration when it became stuck, resulting in an incident where I fell from the chair.

Overall, my stay was enjoyable, and the staff were very friendly. However, my need to complete work during my visit highlighted these challenges.",8,Caroline,2024-11-04

No ice makers on any of the floors, however we did get ice after calling the front desk, as well as a 2nd robe.   They promised to re-supply bottles of water on a daily basis; they did not unless you called.    Overall the room was expensive, almost $500.00 for a Friday night, and barely adequate.",6,Steven,2024-10-06

They then told me "" We have the customer call the bank for a verification code"" I was puzzled but I complied I called my banker and she was confused as well. Eventually it was cleared up only after the front desk charged my card five times. I was also told there was a pin pad that always gave that kind of trouble. Smh.

"The hotel design, fixtures and features of the room were beautiful and modern. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. My only complaint was the cleanliness of the room. Our 5-year old found a pair of someone’s dirty pants behind the sofa in our room (and of course picked them up and touched them). We also noticed the 2 paper cups which were provided for coffee  appeared to actually have been used. The bottom cup which was stacked underneath the other had water in it. There also were not enough towels, wash cloths or toiletry items when we arrived. Our reservation was for 4 people (two adults and two children in a double Queen room) and we were given two bath towels, one hand towel and one wash cloth, one shampoo, one conditioner and one body wash.

Other than these issues with the room, it was great. ",8,Megan,2023-07-04

"My room was on the 8th floor and it was very loud at night because of the rooftop bar. I heard music late into the night both nights of my stay and it was hard to sleep.

One day when I requested my car from Valet Parking downstairs, it took them 25 minutes to retrieve it. When it finally arrived, the guy had all of my windows down, which I thought was strange. When I went to get into my car, the whole thing smelled of weed. I don't smoke anything, or do any drugs, so I was very upset. When I complained to the Valet driver, another worker came right over and started to yell at me, saying that the two of them hadn't even been on duty at the time, but they'd come back to help out, so I should be happy that I'd even gotten my car back at all at that time. The whole situation was not good.

For the price of this hotel, I expected a lot more. No one helped us bring our bags inside or to our rooms. The maids were yelling at each other early in the morning. I had to ask for wash cloths. The only people who were friendly and helpful were the front desk staff. 

I did like my room. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious. Everything was clean.",6,Yvette,2023-06-05

"Still getting their legs under them. 
Cons: 
Management and organization leaves somthing to be desired.  
Staff Checked us in to the wrong room, other people were quite upset with us and gave us a shock. 
No room service from restaurant (Allegory), called twice to order takeout from them, 20 rings no answer. 
No in room microwave.
Valet is worth it if snowing or raining, public access parking in reccomended municpal garage, parking is roof only 1 block away

"Positives: Staff were friendly & helpful.  The surrounding area has shopping & restaurants in easy walking distance.  The room was overall comfortable & quiet.  There was a decent amount of storage areas for clothing.  The room had an empty mini fridge which was helpful for storing leftovers / drinks.

Negatives: One of two elevators was broken, making for long waits at the elevator.  We were on floor 4 and mostly used the stairs.  The room had some cosmetic defects (broken picture frame, unpainted wall repair).  No ice maker / bucket.  The self-parking was in a garage with an hourly rate and no in/out privileges.

It’s location to Montclair State University!,10,Anthony,2023-04-04
"Overall this is a lovely hotel. Checks off all the boxes: new, modern, clean, nicely appointed and great location. Within walking distance of everything Montclair has to offer. Parking is what others have said in reviews. Valet for $40/day with in and out privileges. Or, self parking in a garage just around the corner, no in and out privileges for $25/night. You must park on the roof - 6th level. We chose self parking in the garage and it was totally fine. Also, if you only plan on staying in Montclair proper, you won’t need in/out privileges. The negatives: be aware that the balcony rooms, which you pay extra for, are primarily on the 3rd floor, with adjoining rooms/doors. Had I known this, I would not have booked the balcony. You can hear everything in the room next door if it’s adjoining. We ended up switching rooms - to a smaller room that would have cost less, but it was quiet. That being said, the front desk staff were lovely and were able to accommodate us. Would stay again - but would avoid a balcony room. ",6,Verified traveler,2023-03-20
"Check in was awful because they couldn’t find my Expedia reservation, even with my confirmation email that showed them. They finally found it but only after me waiting for 30 mins. The room although was beautiful wasn’t prepared for a stay. We needed to request towels ( there was only 1 in the room and robes, because again there was only 1).

"The MC - I almost regret writing this review. The hotel itself was quite nice. Unfortunately, the people in the room next to my family last night had a raging party. We called down to the front desk to request the noise issue be addressed. Waited approximately 45 minutes and called again. Our second request was more demanding and Matthew did indeed follow up. We heard him knock on our neighbors door for quite a while - the noise coming from inside their room made it near impossible to hear that anyone was at the door. Our neighbors carried on until nearly 2 AM. No one at the hotel followed up with us. We will never stay at this location again. Disappointing. The hotel has much potential.",4,Mae,2023-01-14

Very clean and modern feeling design and amenities. Also centrally located to tons of cool little shops and dining. Highly recommend!,10,Matthew,2023-01-08
Very convenient and good shopping/dining/movie theatre within walking distance. Only bummer was housekeeping - our room didn’t get cleaned on the majority of days.,8,Andrew,2023-01-06
