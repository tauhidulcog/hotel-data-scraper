The room was clean. Bed and pillows comfy. One elevator was broken so that was very inconvenient. Food was pricey and our dinner was cold. Staff was very nice and helpful. Would stay again but please fix the elevator! ,8,Starlin,2025-10-06
Construction going on nearby. Little noisy,6,Daniel,2025-10-06
Only issue was one of the elevators was not working which made an inconvenience getting to rooms in a timely fashion.,10,Lawrence,2025-10-06

"First the good: comfortable beds, good rates, near Rice (walking distance - 10 minutes). 

Now the bad: this building has two passenger and one cargo elevator. One of the passenger elevators has been out for quite some time (several months). If you ask, the staff will pretend it's a short term thing that they are working on. They are not. We arrived early on Thursday and stayed through Sunday. No one was ever working on the elevator. It was in the same condition that it was in August when we last stayed here. Elevator repairs are expensive, and it's clear Hilton doesn't want to spend the money to fix 1/3 of its elevators. This results in 10-20 minute waits for elevators when it gets busy.

Next, the breakfast is ridiculously expensive for what you get, and it's not included.

Third, the WiFi is INTOLERABLY SLOW. If you're trying to get any work done, forget it. 7mbs down and it acts even slower than that. You'll get better WiFi at the airport.

Until Hilton gets hit with a lot of bad reviews, they won't fix any of these issues.",6,Brendan,2025-10-06
"Staff is very friendly. The bed is super comfortable. However, the bathroom is so so (3 star at best). Shower is weak. The toilet doesn‚Äôt flush. One of the two guest elevators is broken. Need to wait a long time for it. There is a service elevator nearby but it‚Äôs not the same. If you have a car and do not mind driving a few minutes, then there are better options in this area.",8,Eric,2025-10-05
Nice rooms and conveniently located to the medical facilities,10,Miemie,2025-10-04
"Check in and interaction with manager Joby was professional and friendly. He was accommodating which was appreciated. The room itself was clean overall but some areas could have been cleaner. The corners of the bathroom counter were dirty as well as the shelves in the shower. Maybe they were discolored hard to tell. The cleaning staff was nice. The breakfast staff was so very kind. I really appreciated how accommodating and thoughtful they were on Sunday, Sept 28. They really went above ! Overall good stay and I would stay again",10,Ted,2025-10-03

My hotel room was not cleaned. There was dirt and hair all over the floor and bathroom area. There was mildew/mold in the shower where guests items are supposed to sit. Every surface was not clean. I was very uncomfortable during my stay. My child was bitten by a spider within 30 minutes of checking in and had a huge swelling the next morning. I will not book again. ,4,Asia,2025-09-22

"After being told of release from MD Anderson I called and asked for an ada room with a walk in shower, after surgery i could not climb a tub I was told to call back afer a couple hours I was told one was available. When we arrived there was no available room and was told that was not on my reservation after 7 pm i was heavily medicated and had to stay in that room that was obviously not used or freshened up in a while because room had a film of dust then of course no help for wife bringing bags up or down only one elevator was working and the room was right next to elevator and bell could be heard all night and manager was not one bit courteous. I cant believe you are associated with MD Anderson!!",2,joe,2025-09-18

"We arrived to check in after 5:30 pm only to be told our room was not clean yet. They ""upgraded"" us to a room with a ""view"", which overlooked the pool and bar area. Then we were told there were no ice machines working on any floors, but could come down to the Snack Bar and get a Ziplock of ice when needed. There was ONE working elevator for the 19 floor hotel. We had NO towels in our room the first night and were told by housekeeping they did not know to find any (but they did). Someone had disarmed the smoke detractor in our room bu stuffing something in it (was removed by matenance ). Worse of all, our telephone did not work from our room...just gave us a fast busy signal. Transportation to and from MD Anderson was great, as were the Front Desk staff. Not what you would expect from a Hilton property!!!",6,Jacquelyn,2025-09-16

When I called I was told that it was for parking. That's a total of $140. Then customer service stated that I would only recieve $60 of the $100 deposit for parking, even tho they had already removed the parking fee. ",4,William,2025-09-14

"This hotel needs renovations. Only one elevator was working with extensive wait times. None of the ice machines work on several floors, so it is guessing which floor to go to for ice-which was made worst with the elevator issue. There was also a dead cockroach on the floor near the restaurant where they serve food. I opted not to eat or drink anything from there. The only nice thing about this stay was the staff.",4,Ellena,2025-09-06

"I was extremely disappointed with my stay at this hotel. The rooms are very outdated, and the first room we were given had a shower with only boiling hot water. Then, the tap broke and wouldn‚Äôt shut off, forcing us to be moved. The second room was right by the elevators, which was extremely noisy, and to make matters worse, the shower only had freezing cold water. We went three days without being able to have a proper shower.

The only bar/restaurant on-site is very small, has a limited menu, and was overpriced for the quality of the food. Service was very slow because there was only one server/bartender for a packed space.

For the cost per night, this hotel was absolutely not worth it. I would not stay here again and do not recommend it.",4,April,2025-09-05
"Suite room was very large / nice including 2 toilets.  But, room make up had significant problems each night of stay - trash not emptied, only one bath towel, coffee not replaced, etc.

,8,Johnny,2025-09-05
The only thing I had trouble with was the elevators! During my stay only one elevator was working and it would stop on each floor before getting to the 16 floor! Mind you no one was ever there to hop on the cart just had a mind of its own. Anyways this lead to waiting several minutes before I could come and go. God forbid I let something important upstairs I‚Äôm not running up sixteen flights. Please have continuous maintenance done on elevators! And besides the leaking toilet everything else was great I will be booking again to say the least! Thank you Hilton!,10,Daija,2025-09-04

"While the staff was friendly and the cost of the room per night was very reasonable the rest of the hotel is in bad condition overall. The room itself was borderline dangerous due to a bed frame that extends at least 6 inches out from the edge of the mattress posing a severe trip hazard and bruised shins. It is next to impossible to get a good night's sleep with the air conditioner rumbling when it kicks on to the point that you cannot possibly sleep through it. The parking garage spots are so small that unless you have a subcompact vehicle you will have a very difficult time parking your vehicle. Finally,  two cups of coffee and two slices of coffe cake cost us $28 which is beyond exorbitant. This is one of the least expensive hotels in the area and you get less than what you pay for.",4,James,2025-09-03

I chose this property recently for a place to stay before a trip to MD. I chose mainly because I trust Hilton and the price was shockingly low for a large city.

I stayed at this location in the medical district because of proximity to hospital thinking the environment would be sensitive to people in time of stress. My wife was in hospice at MDAnderson. Checked in around 9:30 Friday night. One elevator was out and my daughter and I waited for over ten minutes to go up to our room with a large group of people that squeezed themselves into the elevator which added a great deal of stress to the grief. On top of that the fold out couch was disgusting and painful to sleep on. When I showered the tub filled up as it wouldn't drain. The only thing good was the reasonable price otherwise its a 1-star rating. It sure looked different in the pictures‚Ä¶its rough around the edges and they said they were renovating. Maybe it will be better after that but I won't be back to this location ever. ,4,Scott,2025-08-29

"This was good value for money BUT:

1. Each room has it's own independent aircon unit and the ""engine"" is very loud. I moved the bedside table and a cushion to muffle the noise  still unacceptable.  Otherwise the property is very quiet.  

2.  I was pleasantly surprised to find there was a shuttle to MD Andersen and other places but no signage, no designated waiting area and basically zero explanation as to how it worked.  3 shuttles a day to Kroger and target but when do they pick you up? Or don;t they? And where? A shuttle ""every 30 minutes"" to MD Andersen but what time do they take you back and from where? Then way below it explains shuttle break time from 12:30 to 1 and 6:30 to 7.   Also I waited for the shuttle on a Saturday then went and asked where it was only to find no service on weekends.  OK but why not put a sign up in the shuttle area for people who didn't know that?

3.  No walking map.  Most of the  medical mini city is close and walkable from the hotel (except in summer) but the layout makes it extremely difficult and even google maps kind of gets it wrong. Why not provide a really dumbed down walking map for hotel guests? 

4.  Booking through Expedia w/pay at property led to a large number of weird card charges. If you charge a meal to your room, it goes right to your card.  Lots of deposits, pending charges etc.  Then days after I left the property a lot of the charges get reversed or consolidated so makes more sense but unnerving in the interim. ",6,Andrew,2025-08-21

"I liked the location and that is was a Hilton suite. I appreciated the Crabtree  bath products, soap and lotion.  However,  they changed out the soap after only 1 use.  Also, housekeeping  service became worse as the stay progressed.   The first night/day was great.  The second day, there were no trash bags in the limited, very small trash cans.  The following day there were no trash bags,  no bath mat,  and no toilet paper in the second bathroom.  The third day, there were no trash bags, no soap at all in either bathroom,  no towels at all, including hand towels and wash cloths, no bath mat, only 1 coffee cup, no refills on spenda or cream.  Had to call front desk to request supplies which were delivered.  Now, on to the elevators.  One elevator never worked. I stayed there over a year ago, and the same problem existed.  The last night there, neither elevator worked, and there was a long line waiting for the service elevator around the corner.  It was very inconvenient.  I will not be staying at this hotel ever again.  I am raking my hard earned retirement  dollars across the street to Mariott from now on. Later, gator!!

The ice machines were removed, but they delivered ice to your room. We stayed in a suite with 1.5 bathrooms. The TVs need to be updated. They don't allow streaming unless you download some app. I normally don't watch television in a hotel, but with the family being together it would have been nice to stream Netflix or Hulu. Prices weren't too terrible. The restaurant was ok, nice food options. Internet was good. Transportation to hospitals were good, but we just took our vehicle the second and third day.

"They did not have our reservation even though we had email confirmation. Booked 3rd party , hotel. Com. Would not give us room at quoted price. Was there cause our son was having heart surgery. So Hilton made our day even more stressful. Elevator was broken so only had 1 . Dont understand if you allow 3rd party to negotiate your rate then you should honor it. Very disappointed  ",4,Rosendo,2025-07-27
"This was a very busy hotel - during the entire stay one of the guest elevators was down. This limited all guests to utilize one elevator and the employees service elevator. This caused long lines of waiting with frustrated guests.

"We appreciated the convenience of the location (next to the medical plaza, the tram, and the beautiful university campus). The hotel itself had an elevator closed down the entire week, so we shared one elevator for all 19 floors. The fridge was broken in the room and they moved it to a corner of the room so the built-in wooden fridge cabinet was empty and gross. The staff were exceptional and the food quality at the bar was amazing. ",8,Jacob,2025-07-22

Would make drinks and give shots off of drinks to the guys just sitting at the bar. Took 20 mins for the guy to make our drinks, as there was a whole 2 drinks before us. Probably the worse Hilton I have visited",4,Darrin,2025-07-20
"This place was a breath of fresh air. The staff was very nice. One woman desk clerk noticed I was obviously distraught when I got there and offered me a bottle of water. Everything was clean.

"The room was nice and looked just like the pics and was relatively clean, I found a couple hairs in the toilet. 

The food in the Shamrock for lunch/dinner was very well-made and tasty. 

It‚Äôs right in the medical center and a 10-min walk to Rice University. Hermann park and the museum area are a 10-min drive. Downtown is about a 15-min drive. 

My only issue was one of the elevators was broken down and it took a while to get up or down. Apparently it‚Äôs not uncommon at this hotel. Ask if there are ongoing repairs before booking. 

There‚Äôs also a washer/dryer on the 11th floor if you‚Äôd like to be able to do some laundry during your stay. 

There is a shuttle that can take you any where close, 1 mile distance from the hotel that leaves about every hour. 
Hotel parking is $20 a day but the area isn‚Äôt really walkable and public transport isn‚Äôt convenient so definitely plan to rent a car unless you‚Äôre plan on ride-sharing during your stay. ",8,Linn,2025-07-20

"The hotel lobby is spacious, clean, and welcoming. I also want to highlight that the behind-the-scenes staff I interacted with were friendly and humble, which I truly appreciated. I also noticed that the other guests seemed friendly and respectful, which made the overall atmosphere feel relaxed and comfortable.

Unfortunately, only one elevator was working during my stay, which meant wait times were noticeably long‚Äîespecially during peak hours.

As a Hilton and Orbitz Gold member, I‚Äôve never really noticed a big difference at check-in when booking through a third party, but this visit stood out for the wrong reason. The front desk clerk made it very clear that I wouldn‚Äôt be eligible for any perks because of how I booked. Perks are a nice extra, but I‚Äôm not usually concerned about them‚Äîstill, the way it was communicated left a lasting impression.

I was out exploring most of the time, so I didn‚Äôt get to use the pool or bar area, but both looked clean, inviting, and well-maintained. The gym is on the smaller side, but I was pleased with the equipment variety‚Äîbike, treadmill, elliptical, free weights, and a cable machine.

Overall, the property has its positives, but there are some areas that could improve the guest experience.",6,Yesenia,2025-07-07

"My plan was to stay 10 nights next to the medical center MD Anderson so I could move easily to my appointments.  I had cancer surgery and then 9 days of radiation therapy.  When I entered my first room it smelled like a wet basement.  The air was very humid, the bed sheets were damp with moisture making sleep nearly impossible.  I stayed in that room for 4 nights.  Finally I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore.  The front desk put me in another room just as bad.  The king bed I paid for was two twins shoved together, very uncomfortable.  The refrigerator leaked water on the floor and the drain in the shower was clogged and leaked out into the bedroom.  I stayed there two nights.  I asked the front desk for another room and was told there weren‚Äôt any available. Finally for my last two nights they put me in room 1817, a very nice room.  I paid 200+ a night for these terrible rooms and I would like to be compensated for these 8 nights of terrible rooms.  I enjoy staying here, it‚Äôs like spoiling myself for a few days during awful cancer treatments. The folks at the front desk did a great job but were limited due to the Beyonce concert.

Check in was great but upon entering room there was popcorn by the tv stand. The room was hot even though A/C was set at 65. And the lights were so bright when waking at 5am. Would recommend dimming lights.,4,Luis,2025-07-01
"The staff was friendly. Everything else was unacceptable. An elevator was down which caused 8+ minute waits - I was traveling with 2 individuals with disabilities - this caused unnecessary strain on our trip. The toilet in our room was broken and the water ran all night and it made it unable to flush. When we reached out to the front desk they let us know it couldn‚Äôt be fixed until Monday and we were checking out on Sunday! Neither TV worked in our room and there was nothing they could do to fix it. They ran out of blankets, and pillows which was unfortunate and made sleep uncomfortable. The pull out couch was flimsy and outdated and I felt every single spring in my back - Hilton owes me a nice 120 massage for that travesty of a mattress! And worst of all the towel situation. We had to wait a long time for replacement towels twice. Overall the stay wasn‚Äôt super pleasant but we were only there for 2 days so we lived! Again, the staff was nice but clearly overwhelmed with the weekend and the elevator being down made it 10x worse. Last complaint is the food was mid for the cost. ",2,Monica,2025-06-30

"I don't think I have ever been to a hotel in a major city where you could not drive up to the front door to unload or luggage.  To be required to go up multiple levels of parking, unload and carry everything yourself because there is no bell staff, take one elevator down from the garage get to the lobby, unload and reload in a second to get to the room was nothing short of pain.  The staff was pleasant but the room (a suite) was filled with beat-up furniture. The couch was uncomfortable and the beds were mush. For the money, average $290 a night, not worth it.",4,Verified traveler,2025-05-06

I had a couple of complaints about the floors not being clean enough and the running water in the living area wasn't fixed properly after I complained about it but I was offered to move into a different room but because we had already did our own cleaning and disinfected the entire room with our own cleaning supplies and we had already unpacked and made the beds with our own sheets we decided to stay in that room and the manager said she compensated me for the complaints the parking wasn't bad and the staff was very nice and even the other guests during our stay were also very nice and friendly (the ones that we ran into) I was also told during my booking the room that I had a microwave and a compact fridge we didn't have a microwave and the manager told me that I had to request a microwave so since I didn't look for a microwave upon arriving into my room I didn't make a fuss about it i just know what to do next time üòä.
I loved the view from my room to the medical center.Oh i found out that there is no working ice machines on the floors. So far the price of the rooms yes they need to do some improvements to the hotel but for my stay I will recommend this hotel to anyone that is traveling üòä",8,Meshia,2025-03-17

"Been a Hilton Diamond member for many years and longer just as a regular member.  The property is not new but is very well maintained and clean.  All the people I encountered were very pleasant and said to notify them of any problems.  The problems I'll mention were avoidable but also easily rectified yet weren't.  It started with check in.  I had used their app to pick my room of 1811....this was a king bed deluxe which meant there was supposed to have been the desk chair and a regular chair with foot stool (Hilton says it is in a ""separate reading area""...we wouldn't have minded if it was separate or not....just be there!  It was too early to get our key as the room wasn't ready yet.  But the young male did confirm our room choice and my early registration.  We came back to the front desk 5 hrs later and went to the front desk to pick up our keys....just to find out our room had been given to someone else and we were then assigned to room 18??...(it was on the elevator side, next to the elevator.)   Upon entering the room I saw that it was just a king room..not the deluxe.  No reading chair..just the desk chair.  I had had a long afternoon at the Houston Methodist having medical tests and was too tired to complain.  While preparing for bed we found that there was only one paper glass for the both of us and it happened to be for the coffee machine.

"The hotel is overdue for a renovation. The paint is cracking and coming off the walls, the carpet is nasty, just overall the halls and the rooms are in really rough condition. No vending or water/ice on any floors even though the signs point there is. 

We were originally placed on 10th floor right above the pool area, and the room was small and dark, you could hear every sound from the hall like it was in the room, and there was a random renovation happening on the floor at 8am in the morning, which woke us up.  We hated it. 

Because we had two reservations back to back, we asked to be moved and were placed on 18th floor in much bigger room, which was also very old but not as noisy and dark.

Reason we selected this location was due to Expedia stating EV charging which was clearly ‚Äúfalse‚Äù advertising in the Expedia site ‚ÄúElectric car charging on site‚Äù This was very disappointing. Upon checking into our room Friday evening the sink drain plug/stopper was stuck closed. Requested maintenance to fix. Saturday morning the AC stopped working resulting in temps above 76 degrees. Notified front desk and told Engineer is working the issue throughout the entire building. Saturday afternoon hot water stopped working. Had to take cold showers before attending evening event. Returned Saturday evening still no AC or hot water. Front desk didn‚Äôt offer any concession for the inconvenience. Some time after midnight the AC resumed and hot water restored. We checked out at 6:30 am. The front desk staff was very professional exhibiting compassion.  But their hands were tied.

"The customer service & staff were great, however it‚Äôs a very basic hotel that meets your basic needs. It‚Äôs an old building, the rooftop and pool are extremely basic. I was expecting more from a Hilton hotel. I would stay again purely for the convenience of the location.",6,Adetutu,2024-08-24
"Hotel was clean, quiet & staff were friendly & helpful. Beds comfy.
Only negative is the parking garage has very tight, small spaces. If you drive a 4door, long bed truck, you really must work at parking it. No valet service is available either. Parking is very limited for check-in also.",10,Janice,2024-08-24
"Hotel facilities, lobby, room was clean and nicely maintained. They access to parking was convenient. Room itself was spacious, beds & bathrooms were clean and very comfortable.

There is so much road work being done it‚Äôs hard to get around- had to park in a parking lot next door since my vehicle wouldn‚Äôt fit in the parking garage which charges you when you pull in parking lot and again to leave parking lot.

"For medical reasons we had to stay at this hotel twice, the first stay we received a hotel with boiling water in the toilet! Literally if you sat in the water you could feel how hot it was even touching the bathroom water tank, we had to complain 3 times until they gave us a bigger room for the same price. In our second stay, it was a tremendous experience, first they did not answer the phones, I asked for a room with a sofa bed and there were 4 times that I had to go to the counter in between to ask that they send me sheets and an extra pillow which I NEVER RECEIVED, The buffet is very expensive, 19.99 only for eggs, sausage or bacon and coffee or orange juice, the price is excessive for something so tasteless and the buffet is only ""Boiled egg or beaten egg"", ""Sausage or bacon"", it is ridiculous. Honestly, I won't stay at that hotel again and I don't recommend it either. It's a shame that it is a good option to be close to the medical area but very poor attention.",4,Maria,2024-07-10

"There is limited space to park while checking in, but once checked in, the parking garage is very handy.  (Standard parting garage with low ceiling clearance, so do not drive anything near 7 feet or higher).  

Breakfast was excellent.  Cost is 18.99 per person for the buffet.  This is competitive with other hotels in the area offering same or similar.

Our room was clean and comfortable.  Staff was extra friendly.  Could easily stay here again.

The clerk was very rude when I asked for a tooth brush and tooth paste. She acted very angry when she brought it too me. This is not the kind of service I am used to at any Hilton Hotel.

We had a great stay recently when we came to Houston for the rodeo!  We checked our bag in at the desk and went on to the rodeo on a shuttle that picked us up at the hotel.  Every 30 minutes a shuttle ran.  We returned late in the evening and were checked in quickly and were able to get a great night's sleep as it was quiet and cool.  Was also close to church for mass on Sunday morning at 10:30.  Will stay here again.  We saw out the window that they had a very nice visiting/bar area out close by the swimming pool that would be awesome for those spring/summer evening sunset.,10,Verified traveler,2024-03-13

Great selection on buffet with made to order omelets.  Star was super friendly.  We had the double beds suite. Loved the layout w 2 toilets.

"I came to Texas for a short amount of time specifically 48 hours to interview as well as look for housing in the area. This trip was not just for professional , but also leisure as I wanted to explore the city and all it had to offer. When I checked into my hotel room, I was met with a TV that did not work after several calls to the front desk, I did not get a response until nearly a day later and which I was informed that maintenance would be able to come and fix my TV at 7 AM in morning. They did not arrive until 8 AM and were unsuccessful in fixing my TV despite them bringing a brand new TV, which was the incorrect TV type. The front desk offered to move me to a new room. However, there were no rooms available or clean at the time of this interaction so I was forced to continue my stay in a hotel room with no working TV. By the time I got back to my room from my interview and looking at additional housing it was almost 6 PM and a concert was going on. There was no communication with guess as to this concert taking place, which was incredibly noisy as my hotel room, was directly above the venue the concert continued until 10 pm and for me that was incredibly late given that I had to be up at 3:30 in the morning to make my 550 flight. This concert as well as Hilton dropped the ball incredibly and I would never expect this kind of treatment or this kind of service to be provided at a Hilton",2,Morgan,2023-12-03

"I booked a room with double beds and I had paid in advance to ensure I get it. However, upon arrival they gave me one bed suite, so two of us had to sleep on the pull out bed when I asked them they said it was actually an upgrade but then later on I was told they were out of two bedrooms in spite of making a paid reservation ahead of time
 But the ultimate was when I found dirty fungus water in the coffee machine with underwear soaking in it of course they change the coffee machine out but in the two days I noticed this was one of the corner rooms for handicap guests and maybe it was neglected
 the electrical outlets in the bathroom were not functioning and there were holes in the sinks where soap etc. should have been available , also for a new room you would think their supplies are kept up, but they were out of soap in all the body washes.

I tried going directly through the hotel website but it stated you book online which brought me to your site. I didn‚Äôt like the fact that I booked 2 rooms and you didn‚Äôt book them together. I tried remedying this before we came on the trip but was shuffled between your customer service and the hotel customer service ,8,Ronda,2023-10-21
"We had two issue that we felt were important. First, when we got in our room we noticed the bed was not completely made. And you could tell in the second bed someone was sitting in it. The soap was used and there was trash still in the garbage. There was also a used hand towel on the sink.  You may think it‚Äôs nothing but it told us that they don‚Äôt clean properly. The response from the house keeper was that the dryer was broken and they leave the sheets open so they can dry‚Ä¶. Maybe that‚Äôs true but she had no explanation for the trash and used soap in the restroom. 

Now for a more serious issue. My wife and I were waiting in the hotel lobby for our Uber and the bar manager came up to us rudely demanding to know what was in our cups. She continued to try to harass us by stating laws and her official title as if we were children doing something illegal.  She was very rude and we 100% felt targeted by her. She didn‚Äôt say anything else to anyone else in the lobby with there cups. And mind you these were hotel cups. It made us feel uncomfortable and belittled.  I have never experienced someone talk to me in that manner.  

I will say that the manger who was working the next morning was very kind and sympathetic when we reported the issues. Now did he actually talk to his staff about it like he said?‚Ä¶ who knows. But he did do his part to remedy the situation. ",2,Krystle,2023-10-20

"room was way too hot. bathroom sink did not drain, and toilet kept running you had to shake the handle  we did not sleep good at all due to room not cooling down. if i was staying another night i would have gone somewhere else. luckily my daughter got out of the hospital the next day. i would not stay there again.

"My family and I stayed for one night due to my baby needing surgery at TX Children's. The hotel is literally right across the street from it. The lobby looks like it was a renovated, but thats about it. Our room was very outdated. You can tell they tried to update the rooms with new furniture, but it was still dated. The bathroom was not very clean and felt icky, sticky. The sink didnt drain well, so it would fill up and take forever to go down. Very, very low water pressure as well. So it was a headache trying to flush the toilet. The AC unit was leaking and all of the carpet near the unit was wet..felt so gross. The pool area looks nothing like the picture, but it was ok. Overall, for one night it was decent. I would not book here if a longer stay than that though.",10,Courtney,2023-09-11

"Rooms were all suites (I believe) and HUGE! Beds & pillows were also comfortable, which is always an unknown. This location worked perfect for us as a walking commute to Houston Methodist Hospital. There is no complimentary breakfast ($22/adults, $16/kids) but that wasn‚Äôt important to us. The water pressure on higher floors was low, so sometimes needed an extra flush or two.

Parking is $20 in garage. You can come and go as long as you take your ticket to the desk upon arrival. I was only there while my AC got repaired in my home.

"We were comfortable for our stay. Things seemed clean and in good maintenance. But I feel hilton is not what it used to be. I tried to call and get a carafe of coffee delivered to our room, like most upscale hotels, and they don‚Äôt offer it. I certainly expected that from a Hilton hotel. I didn‚Äôt even see a real restaurant. Just a walk up half Starbucks half order something frozen and they nuke it. There was also no body wash or soap in the bathroom. Had to use shampoo to wash our bodies and hands. Small things for sure that may not be that important but I just expected a little more from a brand like Hilton. I almost went with the intercontinental down the street and thought Hilton would be on the same level. Not the case. But if you don‚Äôt care about any of that stuff it‚Äôs a comfortable place to stay and clean. ",10,Jennifer,2023-07-04

The manager(the one who initially checked me in) ended up giving a king suite, but my niece had to sleep on a sleeper sofa which was not ideal.

Beware DO NOT waste your hard earned money.   Food is horrible.  I paid $36 dollars for a red snapper plate with grilled Asparagus.  It was tilapia and 4 pieces of asparagus.   4 drinks and the tilapia was over $100.  Next don't expect a white night. Rooms all around were super loud after 11 pm on a weeknight.  Finally Parking is 20 a night and was told at desk after 2 nights the incident charge would cover the cost and if there was a problem press the call button and they will open the door.  Ticket wouldn't release the gate.  Pushed call button and nobody answers. Cars backing up and honking so paid AGAIN and drove to the front and went back to the same two guys at the front desk.  They were very dismissive. Asked and argued why didn't you push the call button?  One walked off the other didn't believe me when I said I paid and wanted a bank statement to prove the $40 charge!  Wasn't worth the time to call wife to text me proof.  Listen I come to the med center monthly and have been from here to the Holiday inn express down by the highway and every other option was better than this hotel.   ,2,Allen,2023-01-13

Got a room with door attached to the next room and neighbor was very noisy. Seems the sound insulation was not well done. ,10,Jian,2023-01-08

"This is probably the worst hotel I have been in. We checked in in the afternoon, when we came back room in the evening, we found bags of other guests in the room.  We had to evaculate and moved to diff room.  The 2nd day morning, we saw a guest was furious in the front desk talking to staff there, same thing happened to the guest too.",2,Tong,2023-01-02
The place was clean but the A/C in my suite was broken and the toilet handle was broken and it made noise all night. Since check in I put the A/C on 65 and it never went below 74. Called the front desk 4 times & the last time the night manager hung up in my face and was very rude. She also did not notate my complimentary parking for check out. Hotel also lied about coming to the room and calling to have the A/C checked. I would not stay here ever again.,2,Swaazy,2023-01-02
Good location to MD Anderson.,8,Michael,2023-01-01
