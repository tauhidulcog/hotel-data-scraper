Great price. Clean rooms. Bathtub amd bathroom mirror a lil old but at least they had one on the 6th floor. The indoor pool was nice. Stocked with towels. I recommend bringing your own coffee n creamers. Felt super safe w my kid. Would stay again if in the area. ,8,Shawna,2025-10-07

"Everything was great. My only complaint was that I paid extra for a room with a ""Bay View"" only to find a room with a very small window and the view blocked by the neighboring hotel. Not a big deal, but I won't pay extra for a view in the future.",8,Felicia,2025-10-06

"The staff overall was just ok. No happy greeting and rude house keeping. House keeping came by to clean and I was still in my room, asked for a few mins and I got an eye roll and my room got cleaned. 

Parking is $40/night for everyone, even the disabled. Better off spending the extra $40/ night at a nicer place at a much better location. ",6,Mishka,2025-10-02
"Lobby desk had technical difficulties but made up for it with a parking pass. I could smell fresh baked cookies but was not offered a cookie at check in.

"Schrecklich. Parkplatz war zu bezahlen aber nur mit Scan Code über Internet. Leider hat das bei mir nicht funktioniert. Auf die Nachfrage in der Rezeption ob es andere Möglichkeiten gäbe, nur die trockene Antwort, der Parkplatz gehört nicht zum Hotel und wurde mir freudlos eine Mail Adresse gegeben, wo ich nachfragen kann.  Bis jetzt keine Antwort. Schrecklich. Hätten von Hilton Group so etwas nicht erwartet. ",2,Alek,2025-09-29

"I searched for a hotel with free breakfast.  After I arrived I learned I did not have the kind of reservation that includes breakfast.  I found the reservation process challenging.

"The only thing that was not perfect: the beds and pillows.

Y'all have to turn those mattresses around every few months. When someone sleeps on the same spot for months (or years), that mattress is no longer comfortable (I'm sure some need to be replaced). 
Same for the pillows. It's as if there is no pillow. 
The pillow is there...but it's not doing the job of a pillow. 
When you put your head on the pillow, your head practically hits the bed. Definitely need replacing. 

With the exception of that, everything else was perfecto.",10,STEVEN J.,2025-08-05

It was amazing. Enjoyed our stat. Beautiful view and room. Great staff.,10,Patsy,2025-08-03
Accommodations were okay. Floor was dirty and torn. We booked because of the closeness to our vacation actinides and for the pool. Upon check in we saw a sign that the pool was temporarily closed but staff didn’t know why. They eventually found out closed for maintenance for a month. This was the main reason we booked here.  ,6,Kari,2025-08-03

"Room was excellent

Checkout waiting time was 10+ minutes because only one staff member was on duty

We didn’t get breakfast vouchers at checkin and were rejected at the restaurant next morning, so we had to go back to checkin to get the complimentary vouchers

We didn’t get omelettes even though they are part of the standard breakfast offered

40 USD for parking for one night is very expensive 

Overall, really poor service and experience, I was expecting a higher service standard from Double Tree",6,Christian,2025-07-26

"I booked a room with 2 queen beds and was told upon check in that we were bumped to a single room with a pull out couch because they sold out of double queens and Hilton reserves the right to bump us because we booked through a third party. My daughter ended up having to sleep on a pull out bed that was awful. You could feel every spring and bar. Then, we realized the shower had no shower head - and only a hand wand that was attached at waist-level in the shower. So, we weren't able to shower hands-free. Additionally, there are no restaurants or gas stations around, so you have to drive anywhere. I'm glad I was able to get a refund for this terrible experience. ",2,Melissa,2025-07-22
"I like the convenient location of the hotel. Our room was average. Pillows and linens were clean and comfortable. FYI, breakfast is not included and overnight parking is NOT included in your fee for the hotel. I paid $41 to park overnight. SO if you're on a budget, keep that in mind as an added fee.

Hidden Parking fee? Not a huge deal. Definitely not the best restaurant on property reconsider your meals as breakfast also not included. Check out is at noon and cleaners were opening out door at 9am when we were still in bed. When I asked why they said they don’t speak English. Blankets had what looked like blood stains. Not an extremely bad stay but would never considering staying again. Disappointing for a Hilton. ,6,Katie,2025-07-09

"This was a last minute trip. Literally from one day to another. We loved the location. I felt safe, compared to other reviews of other hotels in San Francisco stating there was a lot of homeless and robberies. I came with my kids so safety is always key. It’s close to the airport and only 9 miles away from fisherman’s wharf, yet traffic is what makes it seem so far. However, during the night I didn’t hear a single sound, we were able to rest. We also paid for the breakfast which in all honesty was decent. My girls made waffles, they had toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, and house potatoes. I will however say that some furniture is outdated with some of pleather pealing off. There were a few stains on the carpet and typical wear and tear. They have an ok indoor pool, again a little outdated and a small gym. The one thing I was disappointed with was they had no jacuzzi. It looks as if they use to in the past but maybe it broke and didn’t want to repair it. Not sure I didn’t ask but it’s there covered up complete. They also charge for overnight parking which is a bummer because we tried staying away from downtown to avoid that type of charge and still had to pay. However, we enjoyed our overall stay. The price was good and no actual complaints here. ",10,Esmeralda,2025-07-01

"I was bothered by the deceptive language about parking. Your ass should make it clear if the parking is free. The parking was ridiculously expensive because they have you by the balls. A good nightly rate is meaningless if the parking is out of control . They also had initially said that I did not buy the breakfast, though I had. Before my anger could surface, the desk clerk all of a sudden found my name on the breakfast list and averted a scene.aside from being ripped off for parking it was a good stay though 35$ pkg at an airport hotel is outrageous.",6,david,2025-06-09

"Parking is $35 a day even for overnight guests. We stayed at this place for its proximity to SFO, but felt scammed by its expensive parking. On Expedia and Hilton, parking is described as ""self parking"" without any indication of $35 per 24-hr. The number one complaint of this place in Google review is parking fee, followed by customer service and room conditions. Hindsight, I should always cross checking Google reviews. Don't be fooled by the 4-star rating. ",4,Tina,2025-04-23

"Our recent stay at the DoubleTree by Hilton San Francisco Airport North Bayfront was underwhelming and far from what we’ve come to expect from the DoubleTree brand.

The room felt worn down and not properly cleaned. The bedding lacked the fresh, crisp feeling you expect from a recently cleaned hotel room, and there were not enough bath towels provided. Since housekeeping was unavailable after 10 PM, we had to request additional towels from the front desk ourselves.

The king mattress was extremely uncomfortable — it felt like a water bed. Every time my wife turned during the night, I would wake up from the motion. It made getting restful sleep nearly impossible.

Parking was another letdown — $35 per day with no discount for extended stays felt excessive. Additionally, our room was not serviced at all on the second day, which was unexpected and disappointing.

To make matters worse, bottled water was priced at $3 each, and despite the prominent signage promoting the famous DoubleTree cookies, none were offered to us during our stay.

Overall, this experience did not reflect the quality or service that DoubleTree is known for. Sadly, we won’t be returning to this location.",4,Verified traveler,2025-04-20
"Booking was easy, hotel room was average. Towels were rough and not soft. Only one bath towel for three people. Had to ask for more. No staff at night to bring towels or linens. You have to go down to the front desk to grab them. Parking is extra $35 a night. The one good thing was the warm cookies they give you. Would I book again? No. ",6,Fedwa,2025-04-20

"Overall, I was happy with my stay here, there were only a couple things that would make me consider staying somewhere else next time. The hot tub was broken, but I had asked about it before booking. The pool was technically heated but still felt pretty cool. Either the pool or the room it’s in could be heated more. The room itself was fine, 2nd floor has a view of a wall so there’s that. The tub floor loudly creaked when you moved around which was just a little unsettling taking a shower. The pillows were not the most comfortable. Breakfast was great! Friendly people, nice sitting area, and great options. Easy to find and get on/off the highway. ",6,Ruby,2025-04-14

I tried calling the front desk a few times to find out about breakfast or towels and wasn't able to reach anyone. So we had to go down and check ourselves.

"Summary: Looks great, clean, safe, super friendly staff. Thin walls and worn-out beds.
The hotel looks great. Staff were great and everything looked clean and upscale. It is a clean business area with access to a path along the harbour.
In the room, my father sat down on the bed and nearly disappeared. We had to check if it was an air mattress!
I decided to make use of the pool and hot tub only to discover somebody had thrown up in it a few minutes earlier. It was closed. The awsome host offered me a drink on the house instead.
Back in the room dad and I settled into our feels like air mattresses and began enjoying the karaoke party that started next door.
You can also hear and feel the elevators which were two rooms over.
Dad managed to pass out. I proceeded to attempt blocking out all the little lights on devices around the room and trying to ignore the party.
You could hear their voices clearly and one guy had the funniest squeaky little Hispanic voice. At midnight, I finally went next door and knocked. It instantly went quiet, and you could hear them whispering to each other. The door finally opened and this very short Hispanic girl peaks around the door and slowly says ""yyyeeassss"". Not far behind her was a very little man, wide eyed peeking out.
Thankfully, they were very nice, the party ended, and it was quiet again...

"Staff was excellent. View was beautiful. Room was spacious and comfortable. My husband had major surgery at UCSF. This was an excellent option to bring him to after surgery as we live 8 hours away. The restaurant was really good. However, it would be nice to have an area where we could go to get coffee/tea downstairs anytime not just in the room. And I don’t think room service or to go breakfast was available. That would be a nice option. I had to go somewhere else to get to go breakfast and coffee for us. Will definitely stay here again.

I thought it was insane that I was forced to pay $30 a night for parking. They blame it on “SF prices”. Yet I’ve stayed at SF hotels and if you book with them there is always free parking. Made the hotel rate not even worth it.,6,Verified traveler,2024-10-27

Two issues: When I booked my stay, I specifically searched for a hotel that had a shuttle to SF airport for my 7:15 am flight.  When I called the day I was to arrive, I was informed that they no longer had shuttle service. I took at taxi to the hotel.
The front desk got a taxi for me in the morning but the driver did not have a meter and charged me $10 more than the driver the night before.  
THEY SHOULD NOT USE THAT TAXI SERVICE.
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY EXPEDIA OR THE HOTEL ABOUT THE CHANGE!",8,Sarah,2024-09-10

Room was fine. However I booked this hotel because it advertised airport shuttle and I knew I’d need to get to and from the airport. The shuttle only ran a few hours each day (a few hours in the morning and then a few hours in the evening) so my mid-day trip from the airport and early morning trip to the airport were not covered. I had to spend $75 on Ubers.  I would have booked somewhere else had I known.  ,10,Christa,2024-08-31

"Wow, where do I start? I've surely stayed at worse hotels (in other parts of the world), but this was just such a disappointing hotel to stay at. I think it more stems from expectations. They listed this as a 4-star hotel, and it is at best a 2-2.5 star hotel. The room (two queens) was alright in terms of size but had the worst beds, possibly even among any of the other similar 2-2.5 star hotels. The beds squeaked all through the night with any movement. Getting out of the bed at night to visit the restroom was a challenge with the noise it made, no jokes. Imagine this, I'm doing an expert gymnast move to slowly get out of bed so as not to wake up the kids from the noise, and then Olympics level gymnastics to get back in. Failed miserably of course, at one point I thought I'd waken up the next room dwellers as well. Worst beds I've slept on. Stains on the carpet at several places. The bathroom, was so poorly cleaned. Hair all over the tub, and a used shaving blade (assuming from a previous occupant) still on the tubs soap holder area. Mold all over the exposed underside of the sink, and generally very unpleasing to look at. (I have pictures of the blade and sink) but Expedia reviews presently isn't allowing pictures. Finally, they charged me for internet even though I'm a Hilton Honors member (for several years). I also found the $30 parking fee in an unprotected open lot to be a bit over the top (but okay acceptable as it's fairly standard in the Bay Area). ",2,Fahad,2024-07-12

"My friend and I stayed the weekend because we were bartending events at Cow Palace. Super clean, super comfy, far enough but close to things. $30/day for parking. Showed up Friday night and left super early Sunday morning so it would have been cool to be charged for two days instead of 3, but they took the $90 from the $150 deposit so at least it wasn’t $240 being taken at checkout lol ",10,Samantha,2024-07-01

"The parking lot is very limited we had to wait around 30 min to find an empty spot since there is not enough parking area vs number of customers.

Once we got inside the lobby no one was at the reception and it was a line up of people waiting to get served

Once inside the room on of the bedsheet had big spot of color like it wasn't wash properly.
The best part was once we have settled down the room beside us throw a big party with loud music. I called the reception however the music was on going until 3-4a.m. very pleasant stay!! If you like adventure double tree at San Francisco is the way to go!!",2,Octopus,2024-06-30

"They need to find a system for managing their own parking lot. All questions are deferred to a third party website with no customer service support. Had to pay for two full days of parking when we needed a spot for just 32 hours. And often the parking lot has no empty spaces, with no way to get a refund for prepaid parking time when all the spots are full. We also saw 5-10 cars parked in no parking zones around the lot because there just weren’t enough spaces for all the guests. A nearby Hilton uses a connected parking lot, but they have a better parking system with numbered parking passes for each vehicle.",6,Mat,2024-06-24

This is your typical stay however if you are getting the shuttle from the airport beware.

There was no mention by the driver about there being more thane one doubletree
I don’t recall any other guidance about use of the shuttle on your web sites. 
This was our first stay at San Francisco doubletree. 
We ended up getting an Uber to the correct hotel. 
Both front desk agents didn’t find my reservation and immediately suggested I might be at the wrong doubletree confirming this is a known issue.  The desk agent at our hotel only checked closely after looking at my confirmation email (poor attention to detail eg cust service).

We weren’t offered cookies like other guests were. Beds were rock hard so comfort was challenging. Bathroom needs a fan. Room lighting was awful. Then today at checkout we discovered we were triple charged for parking, $90 a night for parking instead of $30! Had to go back and have them refund us.

- Furniture is old and limited free water bottle supplies.
- The road outside the hotel building is old, broken, and very bumpy…
- Construction site is noisy in the morning. The the hotel has no reaction after our report the next day.

They only service the rooms when asked. When I checked in iI told them I would only need Sat cleaned. When we got back from a tradeshow all day, we came back to a room not touched. 

Checked out the next day no options to do on TV. So called downstairs to do it by phone. Asked a copy of my bill but never got it, had to call back to get it. Maybe they did not have my email?

"The hotel was very nice, hotel Staff was friendly, and the rooms were very clean! I don’t think I’ve layed on pillows that comfy at a hotel in quite some time. My only 2 complaints were they charge $30/night to park in their parking lot even though they give you a parking decal for your vehicle. I can see if it’s a garage for security but it was an open parking lot. Also most hotels offer some form of free breakfast - there’s was $25/person for hot buffet and $15/person for cold breakfast (cereal and fruit). Oh and don’t buy anything from their gift shop - no prices until you go and pay at the front desk We bought 2 20oz sodas and it was $10. Everything felt like price gauging. They did give out some delicious soft baked cookies that made a great evening snack with our $5 sodas so that was thoughtful and unexpected!!",8,Sonja,2023-05-08

Once we landed we had to call several times to get the shuttle to come out and it took over an hour. Also, when i called the hotel front desk I never got ahold of someone. I called 9 times and none were successful.  Once we arrived and tried to check in early ( aware of the extra cost) , the man at the front desk was really rude and unhelpful. When asked about the phones , he plainly said they have been busy . There was no one else in the lobby. I had also asked if we could have the roll out bed sent to our room and he told us they didnt have it. There was another gentleman at the front desk as well who was alot kinder and he told us that they do have it and he would have it sent to our room. Very disappointing service",4,Marleen,2023-04-24

"The room was excellent, could be better if it had flooring as opposed to carpet, dining area was lovely. The hotel experience was mostly very good. I was disappointed in having to pay $5 for an 8 ounce container of milk. The lady on front desk charged me $15 for 3 milk, $5 each. Later that evening I noticed the price on the price page posted, was actually $4 per box. I told the girl and instead of offering to refund the $3 overpayment, she said, oh I will change the sign. To charge $5 for eight oz of milk is ridiculous, given Starbucks a short ways away charges $2.49, but the entire circumstance around charging me the wrong price and then not refunding as opposed to just changing the sign is downright wrong. 
Would I allow this to stop me from staying at your beautiful establishment again, likely not, because it was poor service, not a poor establishment. This stay was just a stay over from a cruise to a flight home, it was a beautiful place to stay, with so much to offer, loved the places outside to walk and exercise. ",8,Cecilia,2023-03-29

But that market price by the front desk was pure robbery.  No microwave in the room , you have to share with the entire hotel and go to the market where there's only ONE microwave. The beds and furniture is worn out. The bed literally you hear the springs and the furniture chair was shedding. Only one of the housekeepers AND the front desk guy jamal were Nice and polite...

"Love that I was able to book easily after finding out we couldn’t check-in to our originally booked hotel due to power outage. As always, with Double Tree, LOVE the cookie at check-in! ",10,Tamara,2023-03-18

"The lady at the front desk thought I am only asking for free stuff. I asked if there is water in the room. She said no. She should have have oriented me to gift shop where i could find water. When I picked up the water and came back. She made me wait until she was done with the next customer. Then she told me she took care of it, there was no need to wait. All this happening at 2AM was very annoying. I had a 7 AM call to wake up to, and got very little welcome or help from the lady. she kept bringing up honors program and rejected my request because i am not a HHonors member. Sucked for a paying customer. ",8,Hatim,2023-03-16
"The desk in the room was dirty and sticky with food stains and crumbs. The bathtub was dirty, there was no bath soap nor a shower cap even. Disappointed. ",4,Veena,2023-03-15

Our stay was fantastic. Room was spacious andrelaxing. Only 1 issue with the room was the sitting chair in the corner  they need to get rid of it. The vinyl chair is old and the vinyl was falling apart and not really acceptable to sit in. Other than that 5 stars,10,raymond,2023-03-06

Tout est bien à cet établissement si on omet les murs en carton...on peut FACILEMENT entendre tout ce qui se dit dans la chambre d'à côté .,8,suzie,2023-02-25
"The property if off the freeway in a quiet area, staff was friendly, $30 to park, bed was medium (not soft) but comfortable.  Bar and restaurant were open so that was convenient. I dont have anything to complain about. ",8,Christopher,2023-02-25

The shuttle was convenir to & from the airport. We were able to drop off our bags before our check in time. Overall great experience!,10,Marilyn,2023-02-24
"Very quiet area for an off-season weekend (biotech park just north of SFO) so not busy with traffic. Fifteen minutes from where we needed to go in the city. Two minor comments really, the bed was a bit lumpy for my bad back, and no fan to handle shower steam in the bathroom. Otherwise a spacious room, with a nice view of the bay especially at night.

Not very clean and lack of attention to detail. The sink did not drain and the toilet ran all night. There was a large amount of hair on the shower stall. Very disgusting. The hotel is in dire need of an update. The furniture seemed at the end of its life with nicks on hard surfaces and stained fabric.,4,Gregory,2023-02-08

"I felt like I paid way too much money for what the room was. The toilet took 2 flushes to actually flush, our door and door handle wouldn’t lock properly, and the heating unit would make so much noise it was not worth using it, making for some cold nights. ",6,Darian,2023-01-05

"Roomservice nur alle 5 Tage oder auf Anfrage ist gewöhnungsbedürftig. Und der Flughafenshuttle geht morgens nur bis 9:20 und dann irgendwann Nachmittags wieder.
Das Personal war sehr nett und zuvorkommend. Im Bett hab ich gut geschlafen. Und das es laut ist, erklärt sich bei der Lage von selbst.",8,Cornelia,2023-01-02
"Didn’t realize we would be charged $25 for parking, other than that, great hotel! ",8,Luis,2023-01-01
