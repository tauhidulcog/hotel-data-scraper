"We enjoyed the hotel with the exception of the wait staff the morning we were leaving.  They were not being very professional at all.  They were joking around, very loud and saying a lot of words I don't think you would have approved of.  The profanity lased show they were putting on was so bad I had to turn my phone up to all the way to be able to hear what I wanted to listen to.  I was the only customer in the whole area and they were so loud and nasty.       ",4,Gina,2025-09-15

"I requested a room with a tub upon arrival. Guest services indicated that they had checked me into an assigned room prior to arrival and could not change the room. 

Fortunately, the room they’d assigned had a tub (indicating unfamiliarity with the property). ",6,Shari,2025-07-31

Olivia at the restaurant was awesome. Everyone we encountered was super nice and accommodating. Pillows were perfect and the linens smelled amazing. The rooms were quiet and clean. My only recommendations are no more cardboard boxes for takeout and bigger trash cans in the rooms. Overall wonderful stay!,10,Kimberly,2025-07-09

"We had some unfortunate events happen with our flights from Florida. I ended up stranded with a 13 hour delay at an airport with my 4 year old. Hilton had their shuttle pick us up around 1 am and we were able to get a much needed shower and a few hours of sleep before our flight out that same morning. The beds and pillows were like clouds and the worst part about this stay, was having to get out of the bed in the morning. Every staff encounter, from phone calls to in person encounters was superb. Extremely friendly and helpful. I would give more stars if i could. They had great in room shampoo and conditioner that didnt dry our hair out. So i didnt have to unpack and pack up again. Breakfast was ready and we had the option to take it on the go as we were in a rush. Breakfast crew and hostess were awesome.Shuttle service was available every 30 minutes-
24 hours a day!  Such a relief to have found this place after being stranded. ",10,Nicole,2024-08-22
"Two things that I did not like:
1- The terrible smell of the carpet 
2- The water from the shower always was hot or hotter.",4,Juan,2024-08-19

"Property is great! Checking staff was friendly and made me feel welcomed. Room was neat, clean and has amenities that match the pictures. The only unfortunate event was at check out when a lady addressed me and my mom in Spanish apparently because she tough that we were leaving without paying! This anyone knows is absurd simply because my credit card is both in the reservation.
Typically I would ignore such incidents but it is hard to explain that to my 88 year old mother who was mortified because people looked at my like I was trying to run. Some training on how to avoid this kind of behavior from your employees would be helpful. 
Again everything was great and would otherwise return.",10,Claudia,2024-07-19

"The hotel was average . When we arrived to check in we were informed that there would be a charge for parking our car for 12.99 per night. We were not aware of this there was no mention of the charge when we booked. The staff was not exactly friendly but not rude either. They had the attitude so what. When we tried to ask questions the response was you booked on Expedia and you should not have expected that they would not have reviled all of the charges and that they could not get Expedia to update their information.

I have booked with Hilton Garden Inn several times and each time the charges we are charged have been surprise!
They never refund anything and tell you you should have known about them. I won’t book with them again and will not recommend them to anyone.",4,Karen,2024-06-17

"I have always loved Hilton garden's and will try and stay here over many other options 99% of the time. This visit was strictly for the night before I left for a very early flight from Austin airport. I spoke with the woman at the front desk the night before about the shuttle. I was informed the shuttle ran 24 hours and was available for trip every 30 minutes. We discussed me leaving on the 4:30 shuttle but that I also might end up needing the 5:00. She said no problem. I in fact did miss the 4:30 pickup and was there for the 5:00. The man at the desk told me I could not ride this shuttle because I didn't have a reservation and that it was already full. He was not helpful nor was he considerate of that fact that I was a female alone traveling. I ended up ordering an Uber. Needless to say, I paid almost $200 for one night for convenience to end up not getting the convenience and spending more money on a ride to the airport. ",6,Shelby,2024-05-25

"The property is in excellent conditions.  Comfortable rooms and bathroom with all the amenities you may need.  Rooms, bathroom and facilities are very clean and staff were very resourceful.  The shuttle from and to the airport is a plus and very punctual; just remember to schedule the pick up from and to the airport through the hotel staff since they don't pass frequently between the airport and hotel unless it is scheduled. Great location within 5 minutes drive to the airport. Highly recommended.",10,Yermery,2024-05-20

We booked the hotel based on the reviews and honestly it was an excellent stay. Very quiet and spacious rooms. I always check for cleanliness when staying at a hotel and this one was VERY clean. The guy at the front desk was very kind when we checked in late at night and courteous. ,10,Michelle,2023-08-05

I did like that it had a dining area since there were no restaurants around close since we did not have a rental car ,10,Yvette,2023-07-01
"I was traveling the next morning and had a package of fish that needed to stay frozen overnight, I’d contacted the hotel prior to my arrival and was assured by a front desk associate that it wouldn’t be a problem to keep the fish in the break room freezer. When I checked in I was denied that service and lied to by the manager when he said “they got rid of the break room fridge”. Also the AC was out in my room and was told that the entire hotel is dealing with that. This is why I prefer Marriott, night and day service. ",4,Chad,2023-06-29

"The reason we stayed was for the airport shuttle.
We verified the shuttle service prior to booking, arranged time for shuttle to the airport and confirmed a ride back from airport, prior to leaving. We were told the shuttles run continuously until 7pm, and if a shuttle wasn’t there, just call.  When we returned, there wasn’t a shuttle, and when we called, the desk clerk Kelly, was terribly rude, stating we needed a separate return reservation for a return back to our vehicle at the hotel. Of the 3 staff we had spoken with prior to and upon arrival to the hotel, including Kelly, when we initially arrived, this was never conveyed. To make it worse, Kelly enjoyed the inconvenience and deceitful way in which she was conducting herself over the phone, as we were stranded at the airport, trying to get back to our vehicle.",2,Nicholas,2023-05-31

"Front desk was very kind and quick to get me in my room. Excellent room; clean, cozy and bed & sheets were supper comfortable. They provided complementary 2 bottles of water and plenty of coffee. 

After getting situated into my room, I then went downstairs to the bar/restaurant area. I wish I remembered the young lady who served me, as she was truly a lovely person who was e truly kind & pleasant to engage with.

I will definitely be back. ",10,Victoria,2023-04-05
"Would have liked a wider selection of menu items; however, had an excellent meal. My stay was very enjoyable. Worried about hearing airplanes but the hotel was very quiet.  I was on the 2nd floor so perhaps that helped.

"I purchased the higher priced Suite that was supposed to come with ""Drinks and Snacks"" like the ad stated. The ""Drinks and Snacks"" looked nothing like the ad pictured. Our ""Drinks and Snacks"" consisted of a bottle of water. The room was extremely clean; the front desk attendant was super nice; however, I didn't get what I paid for which is super disappointing considering they are charging almost $300/per night.",6,Ashlee,2023-03-13

Lousy check-in experience. Staff hadn’t a clue how to check us in. They were asking if we payed in advance (we did). Had to prove by showing bank statement. The still weren’t sure. It took us 20 minutes until they finally gave us our key.,2,Dan,2023-03-13
