"Our room was clean and comfortable. We appreciated the seating area being a little separate from the two queen beds. My husband could stay up a bit late without disturbing my daughter or me. We didn't really use the kitchenette except the refrigerator. Only issues we had was that the bathroom door is a rolling one that, while providing visual privacy, does allow those in the room to hear ever sound from the bathroom.  ",10,Sandy,2025-09-16

"A great hotel!  I usually have some issues with most hotels, but not this one.  The room we had was well-appointed and everything worked.  The beds were terrific.  The bathroom and shower were very high grade. The thermostat controlled both heating cooling flawlessly and silently. The staff were terrific.  Our room was spotlessly clean.  It was a short walk to the beach and the hotel swimming pool was perfectly maintained.  I give this hotel my highest recommendation.  It‚Äôs now my go-to hotel on the Maryland/Delaware shore.

"Nice hotel, clean and close to the beach. It has one very friendly staff. We have been at this hotel before and liked, it was impressive. This time was a little different. The door of the room was either too old or damaged but could not open enough to let the luggage cart through. We had to lift and push the door hard. We asked to switch to another room and they accommodated that. There are two TVs in the room but the remotes controlled both at the same time so it was either ours or the kids' shows on both screens. For example if we changed a channel it would also change it on the other TV. The cleaning crew are loud but thankfully they came around 7:30 or 8. They chat and laugh very loud.  ",6,Melat,2025-08-26

"When we went to desk to check in Sunday early  evening there was no Staff to be found. There were several of us waiting at desk for 10-15 minutes. A sign said they stepped away!? Staff could not answer questions about why there were no emergency lights in the 1st and 2nd floor lobbies when the lights were off due to a power outage. It was pitch black in those areas, you could not see at all outside our room in hallways.
We had no local TV the entire time during our visit. We would receive ERROR CODES on both televisions in our suite. The staff was unable to help us with this issue. We did not get what we paid for.",4,Dean,2025-08-22
You really need to add more luggage carts or monitor them in some systematic way. The only other thing that was very disturbing was to come home at night and have a car blocking your way in and when I walked in to get help there was no one present at the desk. ,8,Irene,2025-08-20
"We enjoyed our stay! Very close walk to the beach. Clean rooms, lobby, pool area and restaurant. Staff was friendly and accommodating. We would definitely stay again. Only thing we were not aware - we only had access to one parking spot on the property. Our second vehicle had to be parked at an overflow lot about a block to 2 blocks away. ",10,Erin,2025-08-18

"Unfortunately, my stay at this hotel was very disappointing. 
1) The staff was almost nonexistent, and when I did find someone, they were unresponsive. 
2) My room wasn‚Äôt cleaned at all on the first day (‚Äúmissed,‚Äù in their words). 
3) As for the ‚Äúsunset view‚Äù promised in the booking description, it turned out to be a view of the Sherwin-Williams Paints store‚Äîwhich the staff seemed to know about, but they still advertise it as a sunset view. 

This was definitely not your typical Hilton experience - it honestly felt like a bad joke. I ended up staying for three nights only because I was visiting a family member nearby; otherwise, I would have left.

Overall:
The staff‚Äôs lack of presence and professionalism was clear from the start. They were rarely at the front desk, didn‚Äôt answer phone calls, and when I was finally able to speak with someone, my concerns were dismissed with no effort to help or even acknowledge that the guest matters.

On top of that, my room was not clean, there was dust and mold in it, both surprising and unacceptable at any hotel-let alone one that claims to be a Hilton.

What frustrated me most was just how misleading the booking description was. So many details simply didn‚Äôt match reality.

This is not a Hilton in the way anyone would expect based on their standards. I cannot recommend this hotel, and I really hope management takes these issues seriously for future guests. 

If you have other options, I strongly suggest staying elsewhere.",2,DAN,2025-07-20

"Great property; however, because the kitchens only have a microwave and no exhaust fans, it‚Äôs only a good place to heat take out. ",8,Andrea,2025-06-12
"Beautifully remodeled two story hotel that‚Äôs a block from the beach (unguarded). I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve driven past it on my way to busy OC MD and never took notice of it. I won‚Äôt make that a mistake again. The staff are friendly. The rooms are clean and had everything I needed for my stay. While breakfast and dinner options, as well as a small bar were available during my stay, lunch was not. That particular restaurant is by the very nice pool and it wasn‚Äôt open as expected. Some afternoons they have a mermaid at the pool to swim and interact with children. Very cute! I love that this hotel is only about a mile from the DE State park bathhouse, with guarded beaches, showers, and snack shack. There are two restaurants directly across from the hotel and many more a 10 minute walk or short drive away.",8,Barbara,2025-06-10

"It was off season, but hotel was still on point. Service was amazing, staff is amazing and friendly. Super clean even the heated pool which is outside. I guess the only issue was the breakfast. It lists buffet but it was plate order. I would recommend the bundle package for breakfast as the $35/ day breakfast could be a deal breaker for some. ",8,Robert,2025-02-19

"Off season is the time to visit this hotel simply because of the pricing. During summer season, this hotel is quite expensive. In June, the same room that cost $119 during Thanksgiving, cost $530 a night.

Rooms appear a bit narrow but the color, decor and layout was friendly. Nice surprise that the lounging sofa was so comfy with it's own viewing area. Biggest down fall was the ""restaurant"". I put it in quotes because it was not truly prepared there. Glad we went to a nearby italian restaurant since the breakfast was over priced. EX oatmeal $4 was instant . ",8,Laurie,2024-03-19

"Biggest-little hotel Big hotel amenities in a small hotel, 
Impressed by the Outdoor heated pool wow, would love to come back for the Outdoor bar in the summer...I'm jumping ahead, we were greeted by a wonderful 2 story lobby waiting area, an attentive staff was ready for me. All the hotel has to offer was laid out and off we went .. 
 
  There is a nice Bar & small restaurant for breakfast & dinner options, a huge sitting area atrium to enjoy sports on the Giant TV's 
 Family hint ~ in the huge library wall... there are board games for your use in the bottom !! ok into the elevator, you must use a room key to access floors day or night. 
 Now into the room these are set up super nice. and Nautical themed with blue & white colors. Ours had a full kitchen for the extended stay whether a small fam or business man or couple a huge L shaped sofa and a King size bed & the room has 2 TV's.. A good sized bathroom with plenty of light, with a HUGE shower easily fits more than 1..our room faced the road but the doors to the balcony are double layered & amazingly quiet with black out curtains..& shout out to the cleaners doing a great job cleaning & even started the dishwasher ..yes i did say full kitchen.. happy travels

"We were in Delaware this past weekend for a quick trip to look at homes. Fenwick Shores was the perfect hotel for our two night stay, although I wish we could have stayed longer!  The hotel is close to a ton of restaurants, with a few within walking distance, and also close to beaches.
Our room was immaculate, and LARGE!  It was also so nice to have a decent size bathroom.
The best part of the stay was the staff. We had breakfast in the hotel's restaurant and met James. Not sure what his title is, but he seemed to do everything, and was friendly, quick and great to talk with.
We also got to meet Stacy, the assistant general manager, who made check out a breeze and was upbeat and friendly - even though it was morning!

Not a big fan of the location as our room looked over the next door beach house‚Äôs backyard.  This hotel is not on the beach. You have to walk a short block to the beach.

Newer hotel with large rooms and excellent location with easy walking access to the ocean side beach and bay side. Convenient to Ocean City and DE beaches to the north. Friendly staff. Did not try the bar but it looked inviting. Nice lobby area with comfy seating. Rooftop pool was open but the weather was too cool for us to enjoy. Our room was on the road side and I was worried about the the noise level but it was not too bad. If you want to play it safe to avoid road noise during peak season maybe give up the slight bay view and ask for a room facing away from the main road. Would definitely stay here again. ,10,Jason,2023-05-11

"The hotel was fresh and clean. Rooms were big and very comfortable. The complimentary laundry soap and complimentary use of washer and dryer was a really nice touch. The restaurant and bar were extremely inconsistent in food quality and service. This was my only negative with the hotel, food and service is not Hilton quality. I would be ashamed to serve some of the food they did and to defend it saying they know it is nasty but they paid for it and would serve customers, that I could walk across the street if I wanted decent food.
