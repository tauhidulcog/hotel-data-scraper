"I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this hotel! From the moment I arrived, the staff made me feel welcome and taken care of. The check-in process was quick and friendly, and every team member I interacted with went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable. The room was spotless, beautifully decorated, and had every amenity I could need. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and I slept better than I have in weeks. I also loved the little touches, like complimentary water and a well-stocked coffee station. The location was perfect—close to everything, but still peaceful and quiet at night. Breakfast was fresh, delicious, and offered a variety of options for all tastes. Overall, the combination of excellent service, comfortable accommodations, and attention to detail made my stay unforgettable. I’ll definitely be coming back and recommending this hotel to all my friends and family!",10,Claudia,2025-08-09

"We attended a concert at Fenway Park and it was wonderful to walk back and be in our room and in bed within 4 minutes!
The next day we took advantage of many walkable restaurants and pretty sights!
The staff also went put of their way to make us feel welcomed.
Will definitely stay there again.",10,Sara,2025-07-18
Just steps away from Fenway Park. We booked a one bedroom unit. It was just right for our party of 3 adults and one child.  The kitchen made it possible to eat in when we needed to and there were several restaurants within a short walking distance of the hotel. One street over from our quiet hotel was the excitement of game day at Fenway with the Savannah Bananas vs The Firefighters. A fairly short walk to the train let us spend our morning at Boston Commons and the Aquarium while allowing us to be back in time for a short rest and an evening game at Fenway.  We had a great weekend!,10,Dina,2025-07-18

We enjoyed this property.  So close to Fenway and that was the focus of our trip. Nice space for my husband and I and our 22 and 24 year old sons.   They got the pull out and a roll away.  Nice for them to each have their own bed without having to pay for two rooms. ,10,Mindi,2025-07-13

"Nice and clean room, very good size space. Amazing buffet breakfast. Only bad thing was when we came to check in at night there was no one at the desk and we had to ask multiple times to the security and valet if they could grab the front desk receptionist who came after 30 minutes to check us in.",10,Hira,2025-07-07

Breakfast options were fantastic and the hotel was very clean. Very impressed with our stay.,10,Colton,2025-07-04
"Pool was not available as promised and mgr made no adjustment to compensate, despite our mentioning that we chose the hotel for the pool as described.  Bed and couch were uncomfortable, rigid materials rather than the luxurious usually found in a Marriots.  Price of $70 per night for in building valet parking is absurd.  Not impressed.  I have stayed at over 20 hotels recently, and this one was not up to usual.  Was clean and maintained though.  Expect more than that for the high nightly rate.",6,Jen,2025-07-03

"We stayed in a king suite and the room was very clean and well kept. The bed was comfortable and felt clean. The lady at the front desk that greeted us and checked us in was very nice. We signed up to become members of the rewards program because they gift you 5000 points just to sign up which is also free to do. Great location downtown, super walkable to Fenway and to some great restaurants. We had dinner across the street at Yard House and 10/10 recommend eating there, all food was excellent. The only thing I would make clear about the hotel is that the only parking options are $70 valet or street parking. There is no parking garage or complimentary parking. With that being said, we went during a week there was no baseball game so it was relatively easy to find street parking. Overall a great stay, would def stay here again. ",10,Daniel,2025-06-24

"Nice location for my attending a concert at the MGM Music Hall at Fenway.  Fair number of bars close by Fenway but more or less an industrial area.

Had never stayed in a residence Inn...with the mini apartment feel.  My suite was nice, but unlike other places now, no Bluetooth accessible speaker/clock. 

The Hotel staff were friendly and my suite was clean.  

BTW this was the HOTTEST water coming out of the faucets.  I have a restaurant and used to hot water.  This is nearly scalding....IMO.

Unfortunately we were on the 7th floor and unbeknown to us there was a gym right above us. We were try to sleep and all we could hear were loud bangs from weights hitting the top of our room. We called down to complain and they said they would send someone up to ask them to not drop the weights and it never ended. We called again and still the problem was not fixed. We could not sleep because of this. I talked with the front desk in the morning and they said they would issue us a refund and now after 72hrs they are refusing the refund is. Such a disappointment will not be staying here again. ,2,isabella,2025-02-20

"Probably the most underrated hotel in the city!  We always have a fantastic stay here.  It's very clean & modern.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Housekeepers smile & say hello if you walk by them. Bedding is very comfy.  Heated pool is nice.  The lobby has very cool decor.  Little market in lobby even has wine/beer, which was very convenient.  A very short walk to many great restaurants as well as Fenway Park of course!  It's easy to find & the valet parking makes it easy to just pull up to the door, grab suitcases, & head inside.  Loved the cute little touch of microwave popcorn in our room - great idea!  And if I ever get to stay there without my kids, the Rooftop Bar looks like so much fun!  Pricing is reasonable compared to other hotels in the city, but it's just as nice.  ",10,Kathleen,2025-01-18

I did let the desk know when we checked out that the light above the vanity/sink did not work which made it a little difficult to do my makeup in the morning.

Other than that the hotel was great! True continental breakfast, and I think every room is a suite. And within walking distance to great restaurants. We ended up going somewhere else (just 10 min away) so it’s pretty centrally located. Went there for a college visit (BU and northeastern). Would recommend! ",10,cheryl,2025-01-02

Theres lots of restaurants and bars nearby as well. Inside rooms were great. The second night, not sure what happened, but heating would not work. Our rooms, floor and lobby were freezing. We had an uncomfortable sleep as a result and one of us caught a cold. Seems to be that other guests also had cold rooms that second night so not sure what happened. 

I would have given a 5/5 overall if that didnt happen but instead I’ll give it a 3.5. ",6,Daksh,2024-12-27

"Our stay was pleasant enough. There were some rules we weren't crazy about, but suspect they are just about insurance liability, and not made from a hospitality standpoint, but one of them was ""No food in the pool area.""

We stayed here for its location related to a show at the MGM Fenway Musical Hall. It was a very short and easy-to-navigate walk away from the venue. It felt safe walking to and from the venue. Very well-lit even late at night. 

Breakfast was reasonably, good, but not as many Gluten-free options for my partner, but otherwise a nice-yet-typical continental breakfast. The eggs tasted ""real"" rather than powdered eggs that lots of hotels use these days, but I am unsure if that is true. 

The people at the front desk said ""We upgraded you to a suite"" but I'm pretty sure that is what I booked. We did like that there was privacy and a door between the two rooms. The pull-out bed was comfortable enough for my kiddo, but I suspect an adult would be uncomfortable on it (we tried it out). This hotel had some modern vibes, and it could be interesting to see a murphy bed in there, instead of a sofa bed. Would certainly be a more comfortable option for an adult. ",8,Daniel,2024-12-10

"The Residence Inn is conveniently located, just a 5-7 minute walk from Kenmore Station. The room included a kitchenette, which was a nice feature. The breakfast was good, offering a variety of options, and the staff was friendly and accommodating.

However, there are a few things to consider before staying here. The room size was adequate if you don’t plan to use the sofa bed, but with the sofa bed open, the space felt cramped. Additionally, the sofa bed was too soft, noisy, and not comfortable for sleeping. The bathroom lacked storage space, such as racks or shelves, for clothes or personal items like a phone, which was inconvenient. I also had an issue with the USB charger in the room—after charging my phone overnight, it wouldn’t turn on the next day.

There is construction outside the hotel, which wasn’t noisy during our stay, but the sidewalk was closed. There was no pedestrian crossing directly in front of the hotel, requiring guests to walk in the opposite direction to find a crosswalk before heading toward Kenmore Station. This might be inconvenient for some travelers.

Overall, the hotel offers a convenient location and decent amenities, but there are some areas that could use improvement to enhance the guest experience.",6,Zhen,2024-11-30

"Very close to Fenway Park, and all the amenities are here in the suite room, which was spacious and had the basics, including a very well-lit bathroom mirror.  Also, the breakfast was robust and plentiful, and we enjoyed the small, heated indoor pool.

The layout was awkward in a few places, such as where the shower door hits the bathroom door and blocks off the towel rack, and the TV stand making it hard to get to the left side of the bed.  And I was hoping to have an in-room safe.  But overall, very good experience, and we'll likely be back!",8,Alma,2024-11-27
"While the hotel looks nice and was clean, we encountered what I would deem austerity conditions.  We received one half dollar sized bar of soap to be used at the sink and in the shower.  When the cups in the lobby for coffee ran out they were not replaced.  When going to the desk to alert them to this fact, we were handed one cup.  There are none of the niceties that most hotels supply like shower caps, sewing kits, etc..I, in fact needed a sewing kit because a button on my coat became loose.  We received a small sewing kit after going to the desk. In order to use the internet, you have to join the Bonvoy club.  Unfortunately our room was right next to the gym and we were awakened at 6 am because of someone working out and banging something repeatedly.

"The room itself was nice enough but a few things really bothered me about my stay where I can't justify the massive price tag.  There was no parking lot or garage, but instead valet-only parking for $68/day.  I ended up parking at the 401 garage down the street which had EV spots open.  There was also no room service which wasn't a deal breaker but a bit annoying considering they do have a kitchen.  The part that bothered me the most though was at 6am sharp the construction right outside my window from the adjacent lot was enough to wake even the most sound sleeper and it didn't stop until I left.",4,Bruno,2024-08-13

Dirty sheets on our sofa bed that we had to request clean new sheets. Gross.

"Nice hotel in a noisy neighborhood. A letter in advance prepared me for construction noises next door from 6am through 6pm. (I'm not sure why construction is allowed at 6am but I am usually awake by then.) What I was not prepared for was MORE construction noise on Brookline Avenue throughout the evening hours and into the night. I needed and wanted a good night's sleep. I got about 2 hours before my flight to L.A. the next morning. I spent hundreds on a ""nice"" room that prevented me from falling asleep. At 10:45pm, I was asked if I wanted to switch rooms. It was too late to move my packed and unpacked items without knowing if that droning construction motor(?) was still going to be audible. And yes, I tried earplugs. The noise was too loud for late at night.",6,Verified traveler,2024-07-06

"Liked:  each and every person in of the cleaning crew and maintenance...and Phillip and Jazzmen at the front desk.  ALWAYS very courteous and helpful.

Didn't like:  the confusion of me staying on from one scheduled stay to the next.  The air conditioning was even turned off when I was out of the room because they thought I should have already left....even with all my personal items still in the room.  
Washers and Dryers...there are only a few working and many times, items were left in them, hindering others to use them.  
Of course, the noise of construction which I know is out of your control, still that was very unpleasant.

We chose this place for its convenience for our needs and stayed there for over two weeks, so I did interact with the staff quite a bit and used that laundry facilities more often than most guests.",8,Sarah,2024-05-14

"Keys to the room didn’t work - issue was never resolved. We were unable to get in at night, or after breakfast in the morning. 
City view was not city view (either I we saw the parking garage or the building that was being torn down next door).
Staff couldn’t care less and had defensive tones instead of understanding. I expressed the inconvenience of our key not working, the city view issue, and I received stoned faces, and accusatory responses insinuating ignorance.
Pool on terrace level was under maintenance.
Bartender on the terrace was the best part of our stay.",2,Lauren,2024-03-19

"For college visits in the Boston area, the location was great. The staff were very professional and helpful. The valet parking was also very convenient and efficient. What took points away was the fact that the facility was undergoing construction. The AC in the room was loud, the fridge was loud, the billows were uncomfortable, and the water temperature control was terrible. The rate was on the pricey side for the quality provided, but it’s Boston after all. All in all it was a good stay. ",6,Abdelqader,2024-02-22

"The mattress was OK, but it was quite noisy and creaked when my husband or I would shift body weight or turn over. 

Also, the bed pillows were like sleeping on a pile of dead leaves. There was no neck or head support. It was like a deflated balloon. No matter how many pillows I stacked or how many times I flipped the pillows, my head would just sink even with the bed. 

I called housekeeping for firmer pillows to be delivered to our room, but they told me all the pillows they had were the same and they had nothing firmer.

My husband even searched YouTube for hotel hacks to fix this and we literally folded up a bath towel and slipped it into the pillow cover to give some type of support.

It was not restful sleep and we both woke up with headaches and neck strains. This was a business trip and needed to be at our best for our client. We definitely felt otherwise (physically and mentally).

That said, the one issue I really had was the overall comfort level of the room itself. Towels and blankets were cleaned to the point of being sandpaper on the skin. The pillows were clean but so fluffy as to be almost smothering. I'm sure most of this was just personal preference but when I can't sleep at all, it's an issue at the price the room was.

"Overall a really disappointing stay for what we paid. It would have been nice to know that construction directly  outside our window started at 6 am. No sound machines or anything to help make it bearable. If they expect guests to suck it up, the price needs to reflect that. I am not very picky, but the shower was full of hair which was pretty offputting. The “rooftop pool” is an indoor pool on the top floor, and it’s the smallest hotel pool i’ve ever seen. The terrace is awesome with great views, very limited bar though. You can’t beat the location as far as proximity to Fenway, but I definitely expected more at this price point.

The valet parking for the car was smooth and the staff members in this area were also very pleasant and efficient. Our room was great- clean and had everything we needed. We had planned on attending the fireworks along the river but were tired and instead decided to watch them from the rooftop terrace. This worked fine as well. We enjoyed the free breakfast the next day. Just wanted to note that we received service above and beyond from Philippe and Jazzmen when dealing with a lost wallet scare. ",10,Rebecca,2023-07-07
Stayed with kids and tried the indoor pool. Pool was very dangerous and small. My 8 year old slipped in the area by the pool because the water did not drain properly on the floors and slipped. He hit his head and luckily did not have to go to the hospital but it’s very unsafe and needs to be repaired with  signs for safety.

Definitely a great value for the money spent. Parking is difficult but they do have valet parking. ",10,Kiran,2023-06-09

Residence Inn Fenway staff was super nice. Vinny the general manager was friendly and concerned about our comfort while staying during 5 nights. Breakfast every morning is convenient and cold brew on tap is unique! Fenway area is walkable to many attractions. Only odd request was when our bill reached $1500 they wanted to settle the entire bill even for nights we had not used yet. Rooftop pool and bar has amazing views!,8,Michele,2023-05-23

Great Location to Fenway Park !,10,Gary A,2023-04-22
"This was the perfect place for our family and friends to stay on our recent spring break trip to Boston. It is very conveniently located to walk to Fenway Park, is clean, comfortable, features a small top floor heated indoor pool, and a nice complimentary breakfast spread. There was construction happening right next door to the hotel, but there was very clear communication about this from the hotel in advance, so we were prepared and it was not very disruptive. We will definitely stay here again.",10,Aurora,2023-04-21

"Good breakfast selection, attentive staff, ",8,Linda,2023-04-13
The proximity to Fenway Park is so close! The staff is super friendly. Big shout out to Michaela who helped us. The continental breakfast was really good. On site valet parking was super helpful with the possibility to pay for extra time. The rooms were really clean. The only thing is that there is construction going on next door. Early morning construction noise not great but tolerable. Will definitely return when we visit Boston. ,10,Kelly,2023-04-11

"Great place to stay if going to Fenway, just a short walk. Staff were very nice. Room had a view of Fenway & Citgo sign. We didn’t get a chance to use the fitness center but just stop in to check it out and looked nice, clean. The roof top terrace was nice. Good buffet breakfast. Only negative was that the pool was closed for maintenance which was a disappointment. ",10,Jeanie,2023-01-08
