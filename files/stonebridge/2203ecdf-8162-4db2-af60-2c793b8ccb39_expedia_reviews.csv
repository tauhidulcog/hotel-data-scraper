"Hotel is very cute, love the decor, river views, clean rooms and restaurant in the lobby was convenient. There was some loud guest next door to me which made it difficult to sleep but it eventually quieted down. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. ",8,Teresa,2025-10-06
 Refurbished hotel is beautiful.  All staff very helpful.,10,Leslie,2025-10-06
"This property is quite nice and in a lovely area.  Plenty of shopping and dining nearby, not to mention being on the river.  Step onto the river trail and you're soon in nature. 

The only hiccup in my stay was the room next door.  There was an adjoining door, and this must've allowed more sound in.  I was woken up over an hour earlier than I would have liked (on a Sunday) by what sounded like 4 or 5 people talking animatedly next door.  Next time I stay, I will be asking for a room that DOESN'T have a door between rooms for family access.",8,Paula,2025-10-06
"Room was clean and good size.  Bed was average, too soft,
Coffee in room was not good. 
Room was very noisy in the am.

"Downfall was fire alarm going off at 8am on first night off stay 
They are my preferred place to stay when I take my daughter to the university or visit her. I’ve stayed here twice now.
It’s right next to mall and appreciate there are many restaurants to choose from. 
",8,Estela,2025-10-01
This was convenient location for our visit to Eugene. Room was cleanand spacious with eco friendly amenities. I greatly appreciated having a water kettle for coffee/tea. Only issue was noise in next room where there’s an adjoining door. Most insulation there would be helpful. ,8,Amy,2025-10-01

We got into town early and my husband wasn’t feeling very well. I asked if was at all possible for us to check in early. Josh at the check in desk was very kind and got us checked in early. His kindness help us to enjoy our trip and stay. Thank You ,10,robyn,2025-09-27
The property itself is great. Someone spent a lot of money remodeling this property. It almost feels more like a campus than a hotel. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The only downside would be the original single-pane windows. I'm sure those too will be updated eventually. Everything else was great!,8,Lance,2025-09-26
Right next to the Mall.,8,Jasmine,2025-09-26

"We were on a bit of a family road trip and my niece who lives in Eugene recommended it.  It is close to the river on one side but on the side of the highway and the mall on the other.  However, we really heard no extraneous noise.  The room was large and redone in a woodsy, lodgy (sp?) kind of way. The coffee/tea selection in the room was fun and quite good.  We had dinner at the restaurant and the food was fabulous.  Following dinner we did an enjoyable walk along the river.",10,Barbara,2025-09-24
"Quiet, clean rooms. Loved the veranda- great view of the beautiful courtyard. My husband and I enjoyed a drink together on the veranda with the beautiful, green view.",10,Dawn,2025-09-24

This is one of the best places in Eugene. I have been staying here for years. Our room was on the Willamette River with a great view. The bike/running path is adjacent and makes for great walks or bike ride. Thanks again!,10,Kelsie,2025-09-22

Disability access wonderful and service at desk impeccable.,10,Ralph,2025-09-22
"Pros - Room was very clean, comfortable, and a decent size.  We appreciated the fridge and microwave in the ""deluxe"" room, and I loved the white noise machine that was provided.  Hotel location very convenient for a Ducks game shuttle, as well as close to the mall and restaurants.  Elmer's next door had amazing breakfast.  We were very pleasantly surprised that the pool was still open in September.

Cons - Hotel staff were hit and miss.  Some were wonderful and very friendly, others completely ignored us especially at the on-site restaurant.  Hotel restaurant is very over priced for the quality of food and service.  Save money (and time) and go somewhere else to eat, seriously.  And finally the area around the hotel property was iffy with transients, etc. coming from the river and mall parking lot. I would stay here again for a Ducks game, but I would not go here expecting to explore the river or have a place to spend time outside. 

Also - this is advertised as a ""VIP"" property with Expedia, but the hotel had no idea was this was and denied any participation in that program.  Further online research told me this promotion ony applies for Hotels.com and not actually for Expedia, which is misleading.  ",8,Sarah,2025-09-22
"Good: 
very friendly staff
The main lobby area is well-done
Gym was as-expected. Nothing special but not a shoe closet either. 
There is access to a river path that can take you all the way to Autzen 

Bad: 
Literally the thinnest walls of any hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Could hear the people above us packing suitcases.
not exactly “on the river” as much as “on the highway”
",8,John,2025-09-21

It was a very wonderful place with a great upgrade. The view was fantastic as well.,10,Carl,2025-09-18
"Looks like a lot of time and money was spent on upgrading the community areas of the hotel, but the smell of old cigarettes, hits you in the face as soon as you open the room door. The beds are way too low to the ground and not comfortable.",4,Lisa,2025-09-18
Check in when we arrived instead of the appointed time. Excellent dining. Very comfortably appointed room.,10,Rochelle,2025-09-18
"Beautiful location and access to the river trail was great. I used the gym and was happy with it. Husband used the heated pool and was happy with it. Disappointed with no hot tub. Near the highway made sitting outside a little less enjoyable, but the view made up for it. 
We ate breakfast and dinner at the inn. Food was good, but not good enough that we would eat there again with other nearby options. ",10,Deanna,2025-09-17

We had a great visit.  The Valley River Inn was pleasant and provided great food and scenic dining at Sweet Waters.,10,Shelly,2025-09-16
This is an absolutely beautiful location. We had a lovely room overlooking the river with an ice patio and a paved walking /biking path along the river. The room was lovely with a comfortable bed and seating area and a spacious bathroom. Nice big screen tv and a steamer to get the wrinkles out of clothes too! The little dorm fridge with the strong freezer helped a lot because we froze the cold packs for our ice chest. There’s a really nice restaurant in the hotel with excellent food and cocktails called the Sweet Waters on the River. We had the clam chowder and salmon with a one of the best old fashioned cocktails I’ve had. Get that with the Maker’s Mark and it’s delicious. We actually went back another night and shared the fish & chips.  Overall it’s a great location and be sure to try the restaurant because it’s right on the river and a great romantic dinner kind of place. ,10,Toni,2025-09-15

We were only there one night but it was very comfortable and clean. The restaurant is great too. The staff were very accommodating and gave us a 1st floor room near our car to make it easier on my knee. ,10,Tracy,2025-09-15
Beautiful and clean! Could use something to hang on to in the shower when getting out and maybe a rubber mat in tub. Pretty slippery. But Love the remodel!❤️,8,Debra,2025-09-15

"Very beautiful room. Very spacious and clean. Love the balcony. AC is perfect! Fridge, microwave, coffee were awesome to have. I love that the toilet and shower have their own room with a door and separate from the sink. Plenty if lighting. Needs are comfy with plenty of pillows. Long desk table. 2 chairs was nice. They have a restaurant downstairs. I liked that there's multiple entrances and exits key access available close to our room as well as parking spots. I also appreciate the 24 hr coffee and snack market with many food options. Frozen food, ice cream, chips, beer, etc. You name it. I just loved everything about this hotel. I will definitely be staying here again. My one only issue was the tv volume was too low at it's max. Otherwise everything was perfect ",10,Christina,2025-09-14

"Not great. Bed was old spring bed that left us both tired and sore in the morning. Room was one of few with no balcony. Shower grout was black...not sure if it was old and dirty or actually black to hide being old and dirty. Overall not impressive at all, especially after a remodel.

"My wife and I were coming over from the coast to get some sunshine. I had called ahead to see if I could get an early check in. They could not guarantee it which was understandable. I asked if we could sit by the pool when we got here until our room was ready. The lady that I talked to on the phone said yes. Then when I got here the staff refused to honor what she had said. They would not let me talk to a manager and one of the employees literally said, ""whoever you talked to is a liar"". I would not recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Eugene.

We stayed one night while traveling on vacation to Mt. Rainier National Park.  The hotel was great and we had a third floor room with a river view.  The food and service in the restaurant were excellent.,10,David,2025-08-25
"We had a nice visit! Everyone was very friendly and polite. We had our dogs with us on vacation. The room was perfect. We had a river view and nice access to the river trail. We dined in the restaurant on the patio area. Beautiful view of the river. The pool area was so nice and clean. They provide towels and you can order food or drinks to be delivered poolside. What a nice place to begin our vacation!
Thank you!",10,Yvonne,2025-08-25
"Could hear every step taken by the person on the 2nd floor and every time they flushed the toilet. And they were doing nothing unusual. 

Pool was supposed to open at 10am….but the gate didn’t work until they sent maintenance to fix it. 

Overall, very mediocre place.",4,Denis,2025-08-25
"Just some suggestions- a fan in the bathroom would be nice. After a shower, it gets pretty steamy in there. There were 4 of us in the room. I had to hunt down house keeping for more towels. Multiple Spider webs on the deck. Killed a spider in the room.",8,Kathlyn,2025-08-25

"We were excited about the remodel and wanted to love it. The room was sparse. Bathroom felt institutional. Bed felt low quality. There was garbage in the grass next to the patio. Grass was long. Weeds were present in the surrounding bark. Patio chairs were dirty. I regret to say that the food at the restaurant was mediocre. It would take take it up a notch if the outdoor area was tended to and there were some additional touches like robes in the rooms.

What the hotel has going for it is location! On the riverpath. Close to myriad activities for outdoor enthusiasts, concert goers, and campus visitors. And the newness of the remodel. Service by hotel and restaurant staff was great!",6,Jessica,2025-08-19

Housekeeping was well below par; we found biological evidence of the prior guests at check in and our room was never fully cleaned- or even removal of all trash. We got a flat tire in our rental on the day of checkout and they could have been more accommodating with the checkout time to help us deal with that and still get packed etc. I’d give the hotel another chance but I would also try other options on my next visit.,6,James,2025-08-06

There was a scooter convention there when I arrived. They took up all the parking. There was nothing giving anyone any notice that was going on or else I would have found a different hotel. Also they charge $75 non refundable fee for a dog!! Room was extremely overpriced and furnishings were cheap. The bed was so low to the ground in my handicapped room I could barely get out of it. No handicap parking anywhere either!! ,4,April,2025-08-05

"I think the food choices in the dining and bar area were very mediocre.  They need a new chef and menu.  The place was empty ALL the time.  No one at the bar, no one inside the dining room... few outside diners when there were people there. It was better before the fire closed it, but still I think if they improved the food, they would get more people coming there.  We were there for 10 days.  I've been staying at this hotel for 15 years... and I have never seen it so empty.  Maybe the rooms fill up just not the restaurant.   Oh, and the coffee in the lobby is awful.  It comes out of one of those instant machines, what is it:  coffee syrup and water? Even if you brought out the HOT pump type, it would be better than what you have there.  And, another thing, I don't like that the sink is in an alcove, outside the toilet and shower room.  You have to come out of the bathroom, to wash your hands, etc.  No place to put anything when you do take a shower.  ",6,Paula,2025-08-01

I also left an item in the room and have been unable to find out any information and have spent two weeks submitting online and unable to communicate with the housekeeping and hotel management. ,4,Debbie,2025-07-16

"Overall, this is a neat little location in Eugene. The room was clean.  We had reserved a room with a pool view and we had a view of the wall. Although it was a step out patio which was great. I would for sure again request a ground floor pool view if you’re planning on using the pool it makes going to the pool super easy . We were only 40 feet from the gate to get into the pool and was it was a win.  The pool is where it is at— a lovely Pool for Oregon.  Good patio furniture and you can have food delivered to the patio.  We did not eat here but it looks like there’s a nice menu. ",8,Sabrina Amber Taylor,2025-07-15

"The valley river Inn Hotel was recently updated due to a fire that damaged some of the hotel. The decor was beautiful, and the vibe was really relaxing. Staff were very friendly and eager to help, however, many of the staff did not provide consistent answers, and promised callbacks that never happened. The room, while comfortable, was lacking a few basic items, such as a room, service menu or instructions, also no fan in the bathroom. The AC worked wonderfully complete with a thermostat, which was very convenient. The room had a lovely electric tea maker, with coffee teabags however it was terrible tasting coffee. And no option for room service until 8 AM. I think this hotel has a lot of good potential is still a better option than most hotels in Eugene, I hope that this feedback can help them improve and already beautiful place to stay. There was one thing that was seriously lacking and that was the compliance to ADA both entrances to the building I was staying in. We’re not ADA compliant. No automatic, door opener, and stairs on the other entrance, both doors were hard to pull open. I recently had sold shoulder surgery and only had use of one arm. This was really difficult for me to carry things and have to set everything down, open the door with one arm, which was very heavy, and then struggle to get my things in the door and upstairs. This alone would cause me to not stay at this hotel again.",6,Verified traveler,2025-07-14
Everything about the hotel was perfect. The only complaint is regarding one server @ the Sweet Water restaurant ,10,Valerie,2025-07-14

"I booked this hotel for a 3-night stay based on the good reviews and photos, but the reality was disappointing. When we arrived, the room looked very worn and not at all like what was pictured. The bedding didn’t feel clean, the bathroom had visible pink mold, and the toilet had urine stains around the base. The air conditioning barely worked and had a strange odor, making the room uncomfortable overall. Unfortunately, the condition of the room did not reflect the ratings we had relied on. Luckily the front staff was very nice and we were able to cancel the rest of our stay and were refunded. We ended up relocating to another hotel about an hour away. ",4,Jacob,2025-07-10

"This property does NOT like 3rd party such as Expedia. Paid for an upgraded pool view room, got on in another building looking at the parking lot. 

I’m a Gold key member and my iteniery said to ask about any possible perks. My response was, we don’t know anything about that. It was the tone that made me feel bad about using Expedia. 

My recommendation is, if you want good service, book directly and not with Expedia. Hotel prices aas about the same. I only went with Expedia because i did the airline, car and hotel package. ",4,cecille,2025-07-09

"My room was in a separate building from the lobby, and that building has the craziest layout. It was like a maze. I was on the third floor, so I walked the entire inside perimeter before finding an elevator. On the third floor, I walked another three-quarters around the building perimeter to get to my room which was tucked away in the farthest corner. I was disappointed with the room.  I had asked for a quiet spot, but my sleep was interrupted twice from noisy talkers late at night. I expected better from the Valley River Inn, being as it was one of the more expensive options for lodging. Lesson learned. ",6,Karen,2025-06-08

"Our stay had highs & lows. The room was very nicely furnished & clean, but had a few maintenance issues. Checkin process left a lot to be desired. 

The walls are thin, and we heard a lot. The biggest sound issue are the room doors; they’re very heavy & have no slow-close feature so the whole night we kept hearing doors slamming hard, including very late and very early. 

Our shower had an awful screeching sound that felt like my brain was scrambling. I didn’t have time to call maintenance because I was already running late for dinner after how difficult check in was.

Checkin was a poor experience. The agent told us we couldn’t use my husbands credit card because I booked the room in my name (we’re married with the same last name, that shouldnt have mattered.) The process took several minutes of typing and clicking, and after 2-3 minutes I asked him if there was a problem but he ignored me and just kept at it. Eventually he finished up and gave us keys and a short explanation of where the elevator was. We asked where we should park and he said it didn’t matter because their lot would be so full tonight we’d be lucky to find a spot anywhere. When we went to park, what he’d said was wildly untrue and there were plenty of spaces. But without any decent guidance on where our room actually was we had to repark later anyway. This is a huge sprawling hotel with several different wings and at least 2 separate buildings, they should give people some sort of map, we often felt lost.",6,Lauren,2025-06-06
"Very clean. Nice room, well appointed.   Overlooking parking lot.  A/C was a bit loud.",8,James,2025-06-06
"Overall very pleasant with river view. Spacious room. Nice bath & shower area apart from bedroom. 
Suggestions for improvements:
1. More lighting needed in main area. Very dim. Especially no lamps at all on either side of the sofa making it impossible to read there at night. There was a low wattage floor lamp by the desk on the opposite side of the room
, but there was also a desk lamp there, which was redundant. 
2. Could not sleep well with the pillows. Caused neck pain ands headache since they were so thick. Felt like I was sleeping on an inflatable instead of a soft cushion.
3. Understand the modern trend about putting decorative border lighting around the vanity mirror, but it doesn’t produce nearly the amount of light needed for make up and or shaving needs.
4. The magnifying mirror stand on the vanity counter was a nice touch, however, the stand was so short that it was impractical to use without bringing a chair in to sit on, but that would result in even less light on the face. 
5. No hair dryer

"Reserved 2 rooms, when my coworker and i arrived at 630pm we were told that the rooms weren't ready yet. We were directed to the restaurant and assured they'd be ready after we ate. The food was edible but not great,  (burger was charred in places, fish was cooked first then sat in the window getting soggy, fries tasted like they were three days old), came back to the front desk a little after 7pm. One room was ready, still had to wait for the second room. Finally got into our rooms around 730pm. Saturday night i finally had to call the front desk as the room on the right side of me had their music turned up loud in enough to shake the walls off my room, the people kept going in and out and in and out slamming the door every single time. 

Honestly, it looks like a nice place but I'm not going to be repeating my experience with them. ",2,Jamie,2025-06-03

Went for a conference. Hotel was clean and elegant.  The only issue is I had a room all the way in the back and it was like a 5 minute walk to the lobby so I wasn't able to go back to my room easily.  Right next to a mall and food places.   I do have to say that the conference buffet food was the best I have ever had and I have been to over 50 conferences in different areas.,8,Kathleen,2025-05-27

"The location is nice, the property condition overall is very nice. The property has clearly been updated fairly recently. The pool area was being worked on during my stay, work was started at a reasonable morning hour. 

I didn't have time to try the dining but front desk said it was ""the best in town."" 

The only issue I had was the toilet had a small leak upon flushing and the shower drain was slow. The bed was fantastic but may be a bit low for seniors liking. The room overall was wonderful with ample lighting and outlets. The condition of everything was basically new. The sofa was spot free and supportive. 

I'll definitely try this place again when in the area. ",8,Loren,2025-05-22

The room booked had no view and had 2 queen beds. This was horrible for our sleeping needs. And made for an uncomfortable, sleepless night.  When I book a hotel, I am careful to book accommodations that will be comfortable for everyone in the group.
  I won't use Hotels.com again. They really let me down.

Convenient location near restaurants and some shopping. Walking trail along the river was a nice amenity. Older hotel that has been renovated reasonably well. Many archaic design elements still remain though making the hotel feel dated. Not having a complimentary water or basic drip coffee service was a let down. Overall not a bad place to stay but I’ll probably look for a more modern hotel next time.,8,Anthony,2025-04-07

A little spendy for what you get.",8,Brett,2025-04-03
"I had a truly awful experience at the valley river inn My significant other and I were wrongfully removed from our room due to a booking error related to my ID—an issue that was entirely out of my control. The staff initially promised a refund for the inconvenience, but days later, they denied my refund based on a completely false claim that marijuana had been smoked in the room.

Not only was this accusation baseless, but it also felt like an excuse to avoid honoring their promise. We did not engage in any such activity, and the fact that they waited days to fabricate this reason is both unprofessional and dishonest.

Beyond this, the way we were treated was unacceptable. Instead of attempting to resolve their own booking mistake with professionalism, they chose to remove us from the property and later refuse the refund we were assured. This is not how a reputable hotel should conduct business.

I strongly advise against staying here. If this is how they treat paying guests—by making errors, breaking promises, and then inventing false reasons to keep money owed—it speaks volumes about their lack of integrity. Spend your money somewhere that values honesty and customer service.",2,Jimmy,2025-04-01

"We were traveling with our dog in winter, and hadn't planned on cold snowy weather.  Outside dining options with heated patios were sparse around Eugene in Feb. Jenni at the front desk informed us that the lobby with fireplace could accommodate guests with their dogs for either food or beverages.  Our waiter, Echo, was completely delightful and even brought a bowl of water for our dog.  The beer on tap was delicious, as were the appetizers we enjoyed by the fireplace.   I highly recommend Valley River Inn for people traveling with their dogs. ",10,Lisa,2025-02-16

Was hit with a $15 per day parking charge that was not advertised on the booking! The clerk said it was just started. No hot coffee or other amenities most hotels offer Fitness center is mediocre.

I arrived at midnight after a tiresome flight following an active day.  I was tired and grumpy but the staff was very kind to me in the face of my irritability and I am thankful for that and apologetic for my grouchy behavior.

We have been staying at this hotel for years. However this time there was a 15 dollar per day per vehicle fee. This hotel is already on the expensive side with no free breakfast now a parking fee. We will not be staying here again. We will find a hotel with amenities and no parking fee. ,6,Verified traveler,2024-10-30

Under construction with mud outside room. No food or even coffee in the lobby. !! N,4,ROSSER,2024-10-28
"Very noisy, walls are paper thin so you can hear everything from the people next to, above, and below you (if you’re lucky enough to be in a second floor room), as well as anyone walking/talking in the halls. Doors to the hallway slam loudly on their own whenever opened. Plus the train goes by at all hours of the night blaring its horn loudly, so impossible to get any sleep. Housekeeping didn’t clean the room, despite being out of it all day. Room seemed clean enough, but the hallways/stairways/elevators were definitely not clean.",4,Verified traveler,2024-10-28

Front desk staff was very friendly and responsive.  We had an issue with the shower and maintenance was there within 15 mins of reporting the problem.,10,sean,2024-10-14
No hot water. They had to call a plumber. Hot water was available after we returned from a trip. Two days later hot water took 15 minutes to get to our room. Our room was far from the lobby and a long walk. Staff was not aware there was an exit key door near our room with convenient parking. Exit door not properly marked on hotel layout map. Very disapointed in hotel.,4,Jerry,2024-10-13
