My only negatives were the hotel doors slam. My neighbors came in (each night of my stay) around 3:00 in the moriing and let their doors slam shut. It woke me up multiple times each night and that was rather annoying.,8,Cynthia,2025-10-03

"The hotel is a dated property. Some of the major issues I had were:
- initial room had a mattress and headboard with blood stains, requested to change rooms
- water area in the lobby had many flies around
- thin walls and can hear everything happening on the floor 

I was here for a quick business trip and needed a few hours of sleep so i simply tolerated it. Will not return. Staff was friendly, especially the breakfast crew. ",4,Candy,2025-09-30

"I had a wonderful stay in July in celebration of my birthday. The dining area was under construction due to renovations, but breakfast was still provided every morning. Refreshing iced lemon water was provided all day in front of the main floor elevator. I was grateful to fill up my water bottle daily and have it as I explored the city in the summer heat. My room was pristine and cozy. My visit was a solo trip so the room was the perfect size for me. The bed was very comfortable, and I slept well every night. The bathroom was clean, modern and spacious with a large standalone shower. The hotel is on the East River close to Pier 11, Piers 15-17 and a short walk from the Brooklyn Bridge. The Clipper ship was visible every day when leaving or returning from the hotel. I loved my stay and when I visit New York in the future, I’d love to stay here again.",10,Deanna,2025-09-16
"I stayed for 2 nights and i had the best sleep.  The extra bonus was breakfast included. 

This is my first time visiting New York and my experience was so positive. I love the fact that the hotel was in walkable distance to subway and many attractions.

Walking along the water at night and checking out the lit up Manhattan bridge.

I felt very safe walking anywhere around rhe hotel.

"One of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. The front desk staff are rude, unprofessional, and dishonest. We asked multiple times to switch our room and were assured it would be handled, but nothing was done. To make things worse, the staff member deliberately gave us a fake name, handed us keys that didn’t even work, and then had the audacity to rudely tell us to move our own luggage when we asked for help.

The behavior was shocking — disrespectful, dismissive, and completely unacceptable. After a long argument, we finally got the right keys, but still no assistance. This kind of treatment is a disgrace to any hotel that claims to care about its guests.

We are extremely annoyed, upset, and deeply disappointed by this experience. The lack of professionalism and outright rudeness at the front desk reflects very poorly on this hotel. If you value honesty, respect, or even basic hospitality, avoid this hotel at all costs.",2,Neha,2025-09-01

"Abbiamo soggiornato per 6 notti in questo hotel.
Posizione comoda con due linee della metro vicine. 
Il personale lo abbiamo trovato poco disponibile alle nostre esigenze.
La colazione risulta essere per niente varia, la sala adibita è decisamente piccola per la quantità di ospiti, per avere garantito il posto a tavola ed evitare lunghe file ci recavamo alle  07:00 per non avere problemi.
Abbiamo trovato l’hotel decisamente poco curato, odori di cucinato e dí uovo a tutte le ore.
Le camere non sempre venivano pulite e anche per il cambio asciugamani abbiamo dovuto richiederlo personalmente.

"I've stayed in Marriott's for over a decade, but this was by far the worst stay I've ever had.

Right away the details were wrongly advertised, the hotel is boxed in all sides with no views. 

Before checking in I specifically requested for a room with a view and the customer support agent confirmed that, but upon reaching the hotel, I was told that there were no rooms with a view.
I was then offered a room for disabled guests which had a street view.

The room itself has no luggage stand(this is a disabled room btw),
No locker, No microwave, very very shabby bathroom, the rooms had no sound proofing and heard loud noised like gushing water, slamming doors all throughout my stay.

The worst experience was that a Marriott hotel didn't have water bottles for over 3 days. They said their supplies hadn't come. 
A hotel that has no drinking water.

Will never stay here again.",2,Amiy,2025-08-17

Hôtel très mal insonorisé . Depuis le 17eme étage on entend la rue.

"Overall, my stay here at the Fairfield Inn was good. Gio, the overnight front desk attendant made my stay go from just ""okay"" to ""good!"" He was very accommodating and made arrangements to make my first time in NYC a better experience and I thank him for that.

"The hotel is not old, but also not new. Unfortunately, during my 2 weeks stay, they were renovating the lobby, which presented severe limitations in that area, which is rather small for a 31 floors hotel, and where the breakfast buffet is served. But I gather, that the area was being optimised and when finished, it'll be a nice place to spend time and have breakfast. Unfortunately, I did not have luck on those days f my stay, as the works wee carried out throughout the entire time I was there. The breakfast is OK and makes the hotel really worth it regarding the overall price (hopefully they will not put it up after the lobby renovations!). The room was not big, but confortable, clean and with a nice and ample bathroom, AC working well. The staff at the front was great, they were always very friendly and helpful, a real plus of this hotel. The location is also great, 100m from the east river and pier 15. There are nice restaurants in the area and also good access with Fulton Station close to it. And the lifts (2x) are incredibly fast!. I suggest though, that if you decide to have breakfast there, that you go early, as, in spite of the renovations, the space is too small for the size of the building, and it gets crowded towards the end (9:30 AM). Overall, this was a very pleasant experience, in spite of the lobby renovations. I would gladly spend time there again.",8,Javier Alejandro,2025-06-29

"The hotel was kept clean during the entirety of our stay. The staff was out cleaning everyday without fail and we would come back to an our room to see clean towels and a made bed. Breakfast was every morning and they would switch up the variety and were mindful to cater to people who do not eat certain meats. The rooms aren’t the largest but a king was more than enough for a two person stay. The staff was super friendly and did not hesitate to make our stay easier. The elevators move fast, the longest we had to wait was five minutes which was not a big deal. The lobby offer coffee, tea, and water everyday as well.

"I warn you do not stay at this hotel, if you do take everything you own with you. Otherwise items will go missing from your room and the hotel will blame you for housekeeping stealing. They will also tell you about 10 different stories as to what they did internally and what happened. Apparently the wallet grew legs and walked out of the room on its own. 

Yes a wallet that my friend accidentally left in the room, fell out of her purse in the room and didn’t realize it till we had left. 

Will never stay here or another Marriott hotel again. ",2,Taylor,2025-01-30

We enjoyed our visit. The room was very clean and the bed was made every day. The staff were friendly. It was only a 15 minute walk to Folton Station and the WTC. You could see the piers and the Brooklyn bridge reflected in the windows of the building across the road. The breakfast was great even if the dining area was small. But there would be no possible way to make more room as the Hotel is relatively small.

"YOU, YOUR FREINDS AND FAMILY DESERVE BETTER.

New York City has hundreds of hotels that offer competetive rates.  Do your due diligence and find a hotel other than this that will make your stay pleasant.

While listings for this hotel look enticing, the experience doesn't measure up.  Where to start??? Hotel parking is a couple blocks away.  There is no designated space to stop and drop off your bags before you park, and staff offer zero assistance.  No luggage racks available inside rooms either.  I lived in NYC for a number of years and was expecting a budget experience, not luxury.  I didn't expect hotel WiFi that would experience frequent service disruptions without compensation.  The in room TVs (though they are LG screens) are strangely dark.  We don't watch a lot of TV, but this made watching a show before bed with the kids a poor experience.  This place had great reviews for the included breakfast buffet.  The food there was generally okay, and a good way to fuel up before walking 20,000 steps across the city.  BUT it is listed as being open until 10am, but the staff frequently closed it at 9:30.  New Yorkers don't take sh*t from anyone, but in my experience they are not rude or inconsiderate people.  By that definition the staff here are not New Yorkers.  They were rude, inconsiderate and generally unhelpful.  It's almost like you're doing them a favour by staying there.  So please, from 3 nights of firsthand experience, do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else. ",4,Jeffrey,2024-12-31

"When we booked the hotel we didn’t understand how tiny the room would be. It was more like a room on a cruise ship. We had no view, the window opened to another building just a few feet away. When I called the front desk as soon as we arrived, they said all the rooms were like that and all the same size and that was all they had… the sink in the bathroom worked but it was coming apart in areas… if you want a cheap place to stay and don’t need to move around much, this place would do, but definitely wouldn’t stay here again.

"The 2 ladies who checked me in & out were great. No complaints there. Around midnight, my blood sugar went low. I had treated it as i normally do but it still wasn’t coming up. I went to the 1 vending machine they have, which was a soda machine with Coke, Diet Coke & Gatorade for $3 cash or change only. No CC option. I only had a $5 bill so I went to the front desk. A guy who claimed he was security got his wallet out, saying he only had three $1 bills but would trade them for my $5 bill. Seriously? Then I asked the guy at the front desk. He snapped in an annoyed voice, “We don’t give chage. You can go across the street to the deli if you want it.” 
The rooms were not fully cleaned, as there were a couple items that showed dirt when I used Clorox wipes when I first got there. There was wallpaper on the walls, yet some other things had been updated. Some of the limited channels available weren’t working. ",6,Verified traveler,2024-12-22

"The hotel is well-located, less than a 10-minute walk from the subway stations, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the ferry to the Statue of Liberty.

The establishment had everything we needed for our 10-day stay in New York. The room was clean, with daily housekeeping. The breakfast was great, offering scrambled eggs, bacon, cereals, yogurts, muffins, bagels, fruit juices, and many other items available in unlimited quantities.

Points for improvement:
	•	We were disappointed that our room faced a wall with no view of the buildings, contrary to what was stated in the description of the offer we booked. We asked to change rooms, but the staff refused.
	•	The front desk staff were not friendly at all. They didn’t greet us and barely responded when we asked them anything. We didn’t feel comfortable approaching them with questions.
	•	There was a lack of seating at breakfast. Several times, we had to take our breakfast back to our room because there was no place to sit.
	•	The hotel is a bit outdated, with issues like mold in the shower, for example.

Overall, it was a good experience, but there are definitely several areas that need improvement.",8,Carole,2024-11-29

Pulite le camere, molto piccole ma molto ordinate. Ottima la colazione che per essere a NY (dove farla fuori costa 40$) è un gran lusso poter avere dolce/salato/pane/bagel/marmellate/frutta e caffè e acqua per tisane gratis a ogni ora del giorno e della notte. per me un ECCELLENTE appoggio per una città dove tutto costa molto più caro e pochissimi includono una colazione.",10,Alessandro,2024-11-15

You can request bottles of water at the front desk and there is a free tea/ coffee station all day (if it is empty just advise them and they will take care of it). The breakfast has multiple options, we had a vegetarian person in our party and he had always different choices, they even had some breakfast boxes to go in front of the elevators, really convenient. The dining area is small so we took our food to the room, if you want to avoid the elevator crowds take the breakfast first thing in the morning. I will definitely stay there again.

"Hôtel vieillissant, non rénové. Les meubles de la chambre sont très abîmés.la superficie n est pas celle annoncée. Plutôt 13m2 que 22, plus une sdb de 2.5 m2.
Le ménage n est pas fait tous les jours. Et qu'on ne me parle pas d écologie couverts en plastique pour le petit dejeuner
Points positifs : The, café et eau à disposition à la réception. Personnel souriant et compétent. Pour moi cet hotel ne mérite pas 3 étoiles.
Dernier point. Débit immédiat d une caution de 140usd à l arrivée, mais le cash back peut mettre 7 jours... Dommage, je comptais dessus pour mes derniers achats à l aéroport.

"In unserem Zimmer war für eine 2er Belegung mit zwei großen getrennten Betten ausreichend Platz. Gleiches gilt für das geräumige Badezimmer und die Dusche. Der Waschtisch könnte im Verhältnis zum Badezimmer ruhig etwas größer mit mehr Ablagefläche sein. 

Der Frühstücksraum ist für die Anzahl der Gäste recht klein und beengt. Pappgeschirr und Plastikbesteck sind gewöhnungsbedürftig und nicht gerade nachhaltig. Die Entsorgung und Mülltrennung den Gästen zu überlassen, ist an dieser Stelle auch nicht zielführend, da alles in einen Müllereimer ungeachtet der Beschriftung entsorgt wurde. 

Die Kaffee- und Wasserversorgung war hingegen fast rund um die Uhr möglich, da die Getränkespender in der Lobby untergebracht sind. Sofern die leer waren, wurdne diese immer zeitnah aufgefüllt. 

Der Kleiderschrank hätte gern größer sein können.
Vor dem Bad war in unserem Zimmer ein kleiner Abstellraum. Diesen könnte man auch als Schrank/Garderobe mit Kleiderstange umfunktionieren und ansprechender gestalten (tapezieren). 

Die Lage ist top. In kürzester Zeit ist man an den Sehenswürdigkeiten im Financial District und auch an den Metrostationen.

"Positiv:  Lage nahe East River und drei U-Bahn Stationen und 9/11/Battery Park in fußläufiger Entfernung. Nette Restaurants in der Nähe. 


Negativ: Zimmer eng, klein und dunkel. Aussicht auf eine graue Wand. Wasser in der Dusche maximal lauwarm eher kalt. Personal am Empfang war, wenn überhaupt da, mit dem Handy beschäftigt. 
Frühstücksraum, eng, zu klein, Tische wurden nicht abgewischt. 
Wasserschaden im Erdgeschoß, sodass Wasser aus der Decke tropfte. 
Vor dem Hotel Bauarbeiten 
Aufgrund der Nähe zu Pier 17, die Konzerte deutlich zu hören.  Insgesamt Zimmer hellhörig, sowohl vom Nachbarzimmer, als auch von außen.  Deutlicher Verkehrslärm. Laute Klimaanlage 
Wartezeiten auf die Aufzüge manchmal 10-15 Minuten zu Stoßzeiten
Kissen teilweise sehr hart
Fazit: zentral gelegenes Hotel mit Abstrichen.  Wir waren knapp eine Woche in NY und haben für den Preis wesentlich mehr erwartet.  Die Bilder auf der Homepage sind sehr gut fotografiert. 
Wir würden nicht mehr in das Hotel fahren.  Diente nicht der Erholung ",6,Cornelia,2024-09-14

"Das Hotel hat eine gute Lage in Downtown Manhattan unmittelbar am East River: man erreicht das 9/11 Memorial, die Brooklyn Bridge sowie die Metro-Linien nach Uptown gut zu Fuß. Leider hat man aus den preiswerteren Zimmern keinen Blick auf den East River. Da man bei einem vollen Tagesprogramm jedoch das Zimmer nur zum Schlafen nutzt, ist das ganz okay. Bei unserem Aufenthalt wurden die im Hotel täglich die Betten gemacht und die Handtücher getauscht, was nicht unbedingt notwendig gewesen wäre. Da bei unserer Belegung mit drei Personen ein Satz Handtücher fehlte wurden diese aber auf Anfrage anstandslos auf das Zimmer geliefert. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist für deutsche Verhältnisse nichts besonderes, findet in einem Frühstücksraum im Erdgeschoss statt und man isst es mit Plastikbesteck von Papptellern. Man wird jedoch von Rührei mit Bacon, Cornflakes mit Erdbeeren und Bananen, Bagels oder Muffins mit Marmelade, Honig, Nussnougatcreme oder Frischkäse gut satt. Dazu kann man sich entweder Tee, Kaffee mit oder ohne Koffein oder Säfte holen. Das Personal ist freundlich, zuvorkommend und immer hilfsbereit. Alles in allem eine für die Lage preiswerte Unterkunft mit gutem Schlafkomfort. Wir würden sie für unsere nächste Reise wieder wählen.",8,Martin,2024-09-12

"Property was very close to Wall Street, subway stops were only a five minute walk away. Battery Park about a 10 minute walk. Had my young family with me and we felt safe. Our view was staring at a wall, but I didn't book it for the view. Breakfast was continental. Good but crowded and sometime hard to find a seat, so be patient. The staff was good enough to give a room on a lower floor (3rd) so we had the option to take the stairs down, which we did frequently as sometimes the elevators were busy. Hotel had 17 floors and two elevators. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Hotel one block away from Water Street which is busier and best place to get a cab. Also one block away from the East River, so easy walking distance to plenty of great restaurants at Pier 17 and the Brooklyn Bridge. Hotel has a safe but you have to have to give essentially borrow a safe deposit box at the front desk. Very similar to a bank, but I would have preferred a safe in the room.

He eventually found my booking after a long wait , he then started to shout at me that I never told him my email he literally had my phone in his hand and had all the information. 

The hotel didn’t look like the photos it was very run down and breakfast was limited with lack of space

Frühstück wurde auf PAPPTELLER und PLASTIK BESTECK gegessen. Während des Essens lief ein Ungeziefer aus der Couch auf dem Fußboden rum. Das Essen war auch ein Reinfall. Viel zu wenig Auswahl und generell zu wenig essen. Wir haben extra mit Frühstück gebucht (dadurch mehr bezahlt) um keinen Stress morgens zu haben ein Restaurant/Dinner finden zu müssen. Das war aber nach dem ersten Morgen bitter nötig. Dadurch entstanden sogar noch weitere Kosten. 
Das Zimmer hatte einen Ausblick auf eine Steinwand des nachbargebäudes. Möbel waren dem Alter entsprechend abgenutzt. Überall Kratzer und abgebrochenes Holz. Die Tapete viel schon teilweise von den Wänden. Schimmel in der Dusche auf dem Silikon und ein nicht funktionierendes Licht bilden nur die Spitze des Eisbergs.

"Prenoto tramite Expedia, contatto l’hotel per confermare orario di arrivo ed eventuali mie esigenze. Ricevo conferma,pagamento all’arrivo, mi metto sul volo intercontinentale con un bambino di 5 anni e arrivo a New York da Roma 10 ore dopo.Piove, è mezzanotte,mio figlio di 5 anni è completamente distrutto per il fuso orario,arrivo in taxi in hotel e il receptionist mi comunica che la nostra camera era stata cancellata e data a un altro ospite poiché alle 18 avevano provato ad addebitarmi il soggiorno, non ci erano riusciti e quindi va bene se io che sono su un volo intercontinentale e ho il cell spento dormirò sotto un tetto a New York a mezzanotte, perché anche se avevo il pagamento in struttura e avevo ampiamente avvisato di un late check-in ,io posso anche dormire con un bambino di 5 anni, 10 ore in un volo intercontinentale e 6 ore di fuso orario, sotto un tetto alla fine il problema è mio che mentre ero in aereo avevo il cellulare spento. 
Ciliegina sulla torta:quella stessa notte dimentico alla reception un cappello a tesa larga, il receptionist lo mette da parte alla reception, dopo un paio di giorni io lo reclamo, e niente il cappello non c’era più.

On top the tap water is either hot or very hot so maybe they need to have stored cold water in the hotel tank, instead of having tap water heated by the atmosphere. because even I turned on cold water the water was hot and full of bubbles, kind of weird and uncomfortable for usage during hot summer in NYC",8,Michael,2024-08-07

This was a great weekend stay.  The room was somewhat small but I did not feel cramped.  There was no microwave in the room and limited closet space.

"It is a big building with only two escalators. It takes forever to get the lift. The hotel rooms were small. We were on the 18th floor with absolutely no view. We had contacted the reception for a request to switch room, seems like they just want you to leave and keep coming back later. They did that thrice and have up. The reception isn't polite and nobody responds to the emails/messages sent. The breakfast is below average, bread wasn't fresh. The seating area is small as well. ",6,Verified traveler,2024-07-06

"Fairly initmate property close to many stores, dining and entertainment. The room was clean, though small. However, dated. Hallways were narrow and ceilings low. Though breakfast was included, the pickings were slim. Some options not fresh in its least.

My stay here was ok here until there was a fire alarm at 1:45am. I ran down 17 flights of stairs to get out of the hotel. During this time, there was a man over the PA advising it was a false alarm and we should get back to our rooms. The alarm kept blaring
 By the time I was on the ground floor the fire department came and did a walkthrough
 As soon as they left, the alarm kept going off again.

The rep at the front did nothing to reassure or explain fully what took place. 

I reluctantly went back to my room, but did not entertain the thought of sleeping since I felt unsafe. At daylight, I went back to the Front Desk asking for an early check-out without a fee given the circumstances around safety. He said he works at Hilton and the alarms keep going off, it is not something to worry about. Further, he said if I were to check out early, there would be a $75 fee. This is very disappointing. No letter of apology or compensation from this hotel regarding the incident.

I would not stay here again

Nous avons apprécié la proximité avec certaines attractions (ferries pour Staten Island et la Statue de la Liberté notamment) et avec les transports (plusieurs lignes de métro à proximité).

La chambre en elle même était très correcte, propre et calme, bien qu'elle gagnerait à avoir un coup de jeune. Les seuls points négatifs sont le wifi de qualité inégale, et le petit déjeuner - de bonne qualité mais servi dans une salle trop petite avec une très forte affluence.

Our corner room was comfortable but had absolutely no view — the window opened to a wall. It was clean. The bathroom could use more shelf or counter space.

Quarto bem confortável, embora relativamente pequeno (mas dentro do padrão de NY). Apesar de ficar no centro financeiro, consideramos o hotel bem localizado para a maioria dos passeios mais tradicionais (Brooklyn Bridge, Wall Street, Memorial WTC, Oculus…) e os que não eram tão próximos ficavam há poucas estações de metrô (Fulton ou Wall Street).

"The location is very good. We chose this hotel for that, for 5 days. The room is tiny but nice. Downside: our room wasn't made 2 days on a row. First time, we called the front desk and they sent us clean and dry towels. The second time we went to the front desk to ask for help. I was feeling sick and needed to get in bed. But we had no help at all from Amanda. We where waiting for her to call and send housekeeping to our room (6:30pm) but we finally gave up after 45mins. Very frustrating!! She didn't care a bit. Other thing is breakfast, it is included but there are few tables to sit, in a super small space. Complicated to say the least.",6,Lilian Arinoviche,2024-01-29

De to første nettene var preget av at hotellet er veldig lytt; musikk og prat fra naborommet ødela søvnen. Personalet tok imidlertid tak i det med en gang vi sa fra, og det ble bedre. 
Hotellet et slitent, trangt frokostrom når det er mange gjester, lite opprydding og rengjøring underveis mens frokost pågår.

Frühstück für amerikanische Verhältnisse ganz ok. Jederzeit Kaffee oder Tee fürs Zimmer oder für unterwegs zu haben, aber ein Riesen platikverbrauch. Jeder Becher Gabel etc zusätzlich noch in Folie eingeschweißt, ob das sein muss?

La colazione purtroppo però è di scarsa qualità e la stanza in cui viene servita non ha posti a sufficienza per far sedere tutti gli ospiti, quindi o si aspetta o si fa colazione in piedi...Inoltre, essendo la sala molto vicina alla reception, con porte quasi sempre aperte, la mattina d'inverno fa molto freddo.

I requested a quiet room away from elevator. Very pleased that staff accommodated. We stayed 4 nights but did not have face clothes in the bathroom for last two nights. Bath towels are tired and frayed. The breakfast buffet had a good variety but every morning the eating area was jam packed. Not a pleasant experience. Sometimes food items were not replenished so you go without. Too many people scrambling for tables. Hotel has a major issue with this and should cancel breakfast option and lower price. Shame on whoever at Fairfield thought this up. Front deck was always pleasant. King bed was comfortable. Room size was ok. Great ventilation system (except for noisy fan in the bathroom) in the room.

Super cool pier near by and area full of restaurants and cheaper eateries. We will definitely stay again. ,10,Gwendolyn,2023-09-02
"I stayed here for 4 nights. I called the day before I flew out to see if I could check in early and was told yes. I arrived around 11am and had to wait 3 hrs in their dinning area. You would think for almost 200$ a night I would’ve been able to get a different room. 
The view was different. I over looked this beautiful brick wall of a neighboring building that was so close if the windows opened outward I would’ve been able to touch it. 
The vending machine was cash only. 

The staff was really nice though. I think that was a reason for my rating. Honestly though pay a little more money for the actual Marriott around the corner. ",6,Dionne,2023-09-02

"Everything was perfect. There are some reasons why I recommend this hotel. 
1. They provide complimentary breakfast everyday. It tasted so good.

Super close to the subway system to get you anywhere you want to go like Times Square, Rockefeller Center, etc.  Manhattan is so walkable and you're also so close to transportation.  For food the hotel offers a great breakfast and outside the hotel all around are local markets, and places to eat.  It is an Awesome place if you want to see New York super happy that we picked this place.  I never leave reviews but of this I'm.  You can always say something is better but if you want to see Manhattan and are looking to walk and or use subways this is the place to be.  ",10,Robert,2023-05-30

Breakfast was included so we started our day with a quick meal of eggs, meat, bread, cereal, fruit, coffee, etc.  The subway was an easy 10 minute walk, the bus was even closer.  South Street Seaport was literally right around the corner. Staff were polite even when they were busy.  We had to ask for towels twice (there were 4 of us) and we received them in >10 mins.

"Two years ago I decided to be loyal to Marriott because you always get predictable consistency and quality. This one is an exception and on my next trip I shall switch to a non-Marriott.
Major construction on a side of the hotel blocking part of the entrance. Windows don't open - no fresh air to speak of - rely on an unusually loud and inaccurate thermostat system that prevented us from falling asleep. Someone else's hair all over the shower - it wasn't cleaned - I have NEVER seen this at a Marriott property. 
Tiny room (2 people, 1 queen, 3 feet in front of the bed, 2 feet on each side - that's it) is typical of NYC hotels.Poor quality coffee in the room. The breakfast was just not good - the omelette was plain,and just didn't taste right, the oatmeal (which I get everywhere else and is hard to screw up) was runny and looked like a soup - I didn't eat it, no fruit of any kind. No water bottles in the room. The room had broken furniture - lie a dysfunctional closet with a door that couldn't open because it was tilted diagonally towards the floor.
The front lobby looks nothing like in the photos - it's old and broken and has trash everywhere. No bar - the high table is just a sitting for breakfast. Breakfast area is small and crowded - it doesn't support the number of people who stay in the hotel - we couldn't find sitting on either of the days - have to take food to your room - but there is NO place in there to eat it. We opted out for starbucks for all but the first morning.",4,Katia,2023-04-18

"BED BUGS: I recently stayed at the Fairfield Marriott in Manhattan's Financial District, and I was extremely disappointed with my experience. During my stay, I discovered full-grown mature bed bugs in my room, which made my stay incredibly uncomfortable and unsettling.

I would strongly recommend that future guests check their fitted sheets and under their mattresses for signs of bed bugs, as I was unfortunately not made aware of this issue before my stay. I did see other reports online after the incident. The hotel needs to take immediate action to address this infestation and ensure that all rooms are free from bed bugs.

Furthermore, I noticed that the wooden headboards in the rooms could potentially harbor bed bugs and should be removed to prevent any further infestations. The hotel management needs to implement better pest control measures and prevention strategies to ensure that this issue does not occur in the future.

Overall, I cannot recommend this hotel until these issues are addressed and resolved. It was an extremely disappointing and uncomfortable stay, and I hope that the Fairfield Marriott takes the necessary steps to ensure that their guests are safe and comfortable during their stay. I am weighing my options with a personal injury attorney that specializes in bed bug cases for negligent hotels.",2,Derrick,2023-04-03

"We enjoyed our stay here in this very affordable and convenient hotel. It is close to a lovely seaport view. We happened to be here on the weekend so it was quiet. The staff was friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean. The breakfast was self-serve with toasters for your bagel/toast, small fridges for your yogurt and milk, individual cereals, and covered heated stations for meats and eggs. It seemed more designed to be a grab-and-go style so it wasn't homemade and there wasn't much fresh fruit, but it was very convenient and easy. 
The receptionist told us that the third-party sellers had overbooked the hotel and we got the last room, so they recommended booking directly through the hotel in the future, which I will.",10,Lisa,2023-01-04

"I could use my Netflix account on the TV, and the bed was so comfortable for my partner and me. (Netflix n Chill vibes, lol)  As well as, the bathroom was excellent, the shower felt a bit crowded for two, but it's tolerable. The small fridge was convenient for the indoor snacks we bought. The hotel staff were pleasant and greeted us when we returned from exploring the city. The snacks and drinks provided by the guest arriving area were fantastic! Thinking of coming back to that hotel again next time!",10,Meztli,2023-01-03
