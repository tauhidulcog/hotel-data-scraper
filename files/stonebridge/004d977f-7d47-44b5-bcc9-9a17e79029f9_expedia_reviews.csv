"I don't know who's idea it was to put the bathroom outlet on the opposite side of the mirror. No convenient at all. Also, as much as the water stations are nice, it would be nice to have ice on every floor.",8,Ronna,2025-10-01
"We enjoyed everything about the hotel, restaurant and shopping around the area. The construction and road closures made it  challenging. ",10,Christy,2025-09-29
"Great spot especially if you want to stay a short distance from downtown with a shopping district in an upscale neighborhood. I opted for this instead of a downtown hotel, and I’m very glad I did. Great restaurants that are walkable clothing stores around the corner, too. ",10,Amy,2025-09-25

Resort fee is not well advertised.  Rip off. Would not have booked this hotel if i knew of that fee. Need to charge it when booking and state usage options. Would have rather eaten somewhere else and not interested in spa services. ,6,Ellen,2025-09-07

You get two Q-tips they don’t replace them when you use them. You get one bar soap. They don’t replace it if you use it. Lots of construction around the hotel so rooms with Mountain View‘s don’t necessarily see much of the mountains.,8,dwight,2025-08-21

"I loved my stay at this hotel and now that my daughter is a student at DU I will be returning to this hotel a few times a year. My room was super comfortable, with a desk and a reading chair and a great view. I had breakfast each morning at the hotel restaurant, and it was excellent. My ONLY complaint is that the cost of parking was $65/night. Too much!",10,Robert,2025-08-19
Nice property. Only issue was we had to call for towels/coffee replenishing every day of the stay. However they were fast to respond. Parking is a little steep at 65.00 per day. But valet was fairly quick to retrieve the car.,8,DONALD,2025-08-18

"Most visits out of town, when someone asks how was your visit ( be it business or pleasure) you talk about your experiences in the area. After our stay at the Jacquard… you include how amazing the hotel is!!! From the text ahead of your stay, staff that greats you every time you walk in, to the cleanliness and beautiful decor",10,Mary Anne,2025-08-11
"Enjoyed the roof top bar and pool, especially in the evenings. They had a good DJ that set the vibe. Area surrounding the hotel has abundant shopping, cafes and restaurants.Especially loved the complimentary passes to the Denver Botanical Garden which is a treasure in Denver.
Bed was super comfortable and the room was cleaned daily. Would definitely recommend!",10,Michelle,2025-08-10

Expensive one-night staycation excited about the rooftop pool. Incredibly narrow pool with freezing temperatures. Private cabanas that eat up the entire rooftop space + 90% of folks at the pool were not even guests so we spent $300+ to put towels down on concrete by the exit door because all chairs were taken. Pretty rude rooftop bar staff- charged $10 for a 1/4 cup of club soda. ,6,Ian,2025-07-05
Beautiful hotel in a great location.  Easy walk to shopping and restaurants.  Rooftop bar and pool was very special.  Rooms was large and had a great view of downtown and mountains. ,10,Thomas,2025-07-05
"If you’re considering staying at The Jacquard in Cherry Creek—don’t. There was constant, deafening construction on both sides of the building during my stay, making it nearly impossible to relax or even hold a conversation in peace.

Parking? Forget about it. There’s no self-parking anywhere nearby, and valet is a jaw-dropping $65/day. For what, exactly? Subpar service and a chaotic arrival experience?

The elevators are a complete disaster—unpredictable, slow, and seemingly confused. I waited over five minutes more than once with three elevators just sitting idle.

As a Marriott Elite member who’s spent over a year of my life in Marriott properties, I was shocked when the front desk gave me pushback over a simple late checkout. The loyalty recognition here is non-existent.

And the final straw: I was enjoying a drink by the rooftop pool—one I brought myself—when the waitress told me to pour it out. There was zero signage indicating outside drinks weren’t allowed, and the irony? I had spent plenty on poolside food and beverages on previous days. It was petty, poorly handled, and completely unnecessary.

To top it all off:
– The hot tub wasn’t hot
– The pool was too cold to enjoy
– And frankly, the Halcyon rooftop is far better in every way

This was hands down the worst hotel experience I’ve had in recent memory. Save yourself the frustration—look elsewhere.",2,Daniel,2025-07-01
"Incredible staff, love the ambiance and food was not your standard Hotel food. I will be staying here moving forward when I travel to Denver! ",10,Justin,2025-06-30

"Our room was slightly small but very comfy. Loved the shower. Nice water pressure. Bed comfy, but pillows too soft. Lovely watch tv in bed set up. Tv is huge. Rooftop pool is great! Construction outside is not too terrible. ",8,Meigen,2025-06-30
"The roof top pool and location of this hotel made the property. Food at the hotel was decent but there are lots of great places to eat and drink within walking distance in the Cherry Creek area. It is not walkable to downtown Denver, which was ok with us, but don't stay here if you're hoping to be downtown. ",10,Kristen,2025-06-29

"very nice, pool and rooftop bar just opened for the season so not much available to drink at the rooftop bar but the pool and hot tub were great. Room was fine, not huge. Downstair bar is hopping with great drinks. They were very timely when cleaning the room. People at the front desk were super friendly and willing to help or answer any questions - one downside is the construction that is going on right next to the hotel, disrupts drop-off and there was some noise in the mornings

"The $30 daily amenities fee is abridge too far when they don’t offer much of anything during the winter. The food, which can supposedly offset the fee, was mediocre and overpriced.

"For being a newer hotel, the room was very rundown. Almost seemed as though they used recycled furniture. It was beat up with scratches. From the desk to the bedside, stand to the bath vanity, all were in rough shape. The film on the shower door was peeling and a plastic edge on the bath door was coming off.",6,Douglas,2025-01-09

"This property was dumb. For a fancy hotel, my expectation is that there's a level of quality and thought toward the experience. I had to crawl into the wardrobe to make my nespresso, the curtains were broken, little fixtures were hung crooked, there's stains on the lampshade. The bathroom design for example - it was fine for me staying alone, but there was a separate toilet room and then a glass door that was open at the top and the bottom to the room. That's just dumb spacial design. Valet parking is $65 / night. Truly, for an expensive hotel, there was such a needless amount of production to have my minimal needs met - a comfortable sleep (I arrived at 1am and couldn't close my curtains so my neighbor across the way could see in and there were lights shining in) and a cup of coffee in the am. I will not stay here again.",4,Alisha,2024-10-11

"We loved the stay at Jacquard. Convenient location to walk around shops and galleries. We were not happy with the food at the hitel, but the choices around  the hotel are really great. Close to Red Rocks, and Cherrry Creek is such a great community.  Definately go to the Sunday farmers Market on Pearl, great local organic foods. Waffles on a stick were amazimg!",10,DeeDee,2024-08-18
"We arrived at 3:00 to check in and were told our room wasn't ready and that check-in was at 4. When I politely noted that their own website shows check-in at 3, I was told that ""our new check-in time is 4:00 starting today"". Seems like notifying guests checking in that day - or making an exception would be in order but we waited over an hour for our room. Hotel staff said that 'we've had a lot of late check-outs today'.  Maybe crack down on late checkouts or hire more cleaning staff? No one wants to pay $350 a night for a room only to have no room available at the advertised check-in time.  We have a teen who wanted to use the pool but by the time we got checked in at 4:30, it was raining and the rooftop turns into 21  at 6pm.  Have stayed in lots of higher end hotels (Brown Palace, Broadmoor) without incident, we were surprised by the meager cost-to-quality ratio. This place aspires to be at that level and charges the same, but rooms are tiny, amenities are minimal (e.g., no lobby) and staff wasn't super welcoming or accommodating. Overall, it was a very pretentious vibe while not offering the product or service that might justify pretentiousness. The room was clean though so I have no beef with cleaning staff. Will probably not stay here when traveling to Denver in the future.",4,Judith,2024-08-15
The hotel itself is wonderful and in a great location. The reason for 4 stars is that I paid for my stay through hotels.com yet the hotel charged my “incidentals” credit card for the entire stay again. They did quickly resolve it with a credit when I called but just be aware and be sure and check your credit card charges. ,8,Verified traveler,2024-08-14

There was space to put my things, a desk and an additional chair. I’d definitely stay here again, but it was not a place where anyone offered to help me with my luggage and the other thing I didn’t like was that I couldn’t order room service breakfast the night before for a particular time. I called ahead and the person said he would leave a note with the time, but my order was delivered an hour earlier so I was woken up an hour earlier than I wanted to be. If you stay here, go downstairs for breakfast or call the morning of if you have plenty of time to get it delivered. ",10,Dana,2024-07-14

Had noisy neighbors (yelling over loud TV at 3 am) the first night. Staff moved us to a very quiet spot for the rest of our stay. Desk Staff very pleasant and helpful. Asked for housekeeping but got none after our first morning. Otherwise 5 star. ,8,JillAnne,2024-06-11
"Must valet park car $65/night, no street parking in an amazing bustling neighborhood. We didn't swim but common complaint on elevator was the hotel closed the pool noon-5pm. After 5pm no one under 21 can access the pool. Location was the main appeal. Modern and beautiful. Great restaurant ",6,Verified traveler,2024-06-11

"I stayed at the Jacquard Hotel from 4/24/2024-04/27/2024. I came to Denver to attend my friend wedding. This hotel is very nice. The staff was very friendly and amazing. Actually, the few days I was booked here the hotel was complete sold out. The valet service was great but $65.00 to valet park with in and out privileges was expensive but was worth it for convivence. I hope the valet workers are getting paid very well for this price per car but if they are not, they deserve a raise. Overall amazing stay in cherry creek, was near a lot of eateries, restaurants and cherry creek mall. Overall, a great stay and when I visit Denver again, I would definitely stay at this hotel.",10,aqueelah,2024-04-29

"This hotel has the potential for a much higher rating, however, our experience was horrible. We only stayed 1 night, and that was too much. From check in, we were told that the king room we booked was unavailable and were given a double queen. Fine. Once in the room, with barely enough room to walk, we attempted to lower the shades, which came off the track and were difficult to close. Then we turned on the tv to relax before bed and it looked like it had been punched or a large object hit it because there was a big thick line down the side of the screen and what looked like cracks all along the top and bottom. It was nearly impossible to watch tv. We called to notify the front desk for the next guests, but they insisted on sending an engineer up to see if he could fix it. He arrived about 30 min. later only to inform us that it wasn’t fixable and they couldn’t replace it tonight, which I thought was pretty obvious by around 9:30pm. Then we tried to sleep, but the pillows were so thick, it was hard to get comfortable and the mini fridge was super loud. Fast forward to the next morning, about 45 min. Before check out and someone knocks on our door while we were getting ready. We didn’t answer the first time, then they returned in about 10min. and decided it was ok to just enter our room, despite the “Do not disturb” sign being on the door. We were pretty outraged! We were literally checking out within 30 min. Unacceptable!!",2,Denise Lynn,2024-03-07

"There were a few things that weren’t working in the room, but the front desk staff attempted to resolve the issues right away. Room service options are surprisingly limited. Valet parking is very overpriced for the area - $65/night.  ",8,Verified traveler,2024-02-17
"Perfect for what we were looking for.  High end couple of days away from the illegal immigrant ridden city of Denver while getting used to the altitude before heading into the mountains.  

Early check in, great room service, rooftop hot tub perfect, staff was amazing, cherry creek amazing.

Great job.",10,Matthew,2024-02-14
"We had to switch rooms because the black out shade was not in the track and once I rolled it down it was torn on the right side towards the top,  The staff was helpful in moving us to another room right away and we had the same issue in the second room but just didn’t want to move again. The management needs to check the rooms and fix the issue with the blackout shade. We got moved to a room that had the ventilation system right outside our door so it was a bit noisy in the room. The valet staff was not very helpful this morning when we left at 4:30am. ",8,Boris,2024-02-12

"Great Location and facilities. Regrettably bathroom did not have any heating or anywhere to hang the towel when exiting the shower.....so it got quite unnecessarily cold. Also kept hitting my head on that floor lamp in the corner, very close to the blind pulley.....it should go.....I don't see that it serves any purpose. The room drinking water system would be great if you had it in every room (I know....cost prohibitive) and one didn't have to go out to refill the bottle they give you in the room. I drink a lot of water. Staff very nice and friendly. Finally not sure if it was just my room but the Nespresso machine was hard to figure out - no telling what each coffee pod was and some of us do use regular sugar and instructions would be helpful as not everyone knows how to use them (or am I really showing my age). The room otherwise was well appointed and except for the very occasional sound of the guests next door allowing their doors to self close, the room was extremely quiet.",8,John,2023-12-22

"We would absolutely stay at the Jacquard again. Our only complaint was that our room (823) did not have hot water in the shower. Warm water, yes. But hot? No. Might be due to the fact we were showering at 10:30 just before check out and we were on the top floor at the end of the water line at the end of the building. Regardless, our stay was great minus that one issue. ",10,Brian,2023-12-18

"I booked with points through Hotels.com and had booked a corner room full of windows as the hotel described. I got a corner room with two vertical windows one next to the toilet. It was their ADA room, stains on carpet and when I opened the other vertical window it looked right into an alley and another building so couldn’t open that window. I complained.

There was a surprising amount of kids in the hotel, seeing as it is definitely an upscale place to stay and not really near anything where you'd expect a lot of families.
