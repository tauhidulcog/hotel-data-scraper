"Reserve una habitaci√≥n Premier y la Que me dieron NO era como la de la foto de esa categor√≠a, aunque dec√≠an que s√≠ era pero cambiaba la configuraci√≥n. Adicional a ello, el aire acondicionado no funcionaba. El personal siempre fue amable e intentaron resolver aunque sin √©xito, por lo que tuvimos que cambiarnos a una habitaci√≥n est√°ndar (m√°s econ√≥mica de la que pagu√©) con tal de dormir con aire acondicionado.

" Spur-of-the-moment decision to stay at Pennyweight based on proximity to Boston's North Station. Compared to three other nearby options, price was right. Two nights. If you're looking for a place to sleep and shower and want location near North Station, TD Garden and North End, you overlook the very small room (king), limited in-house dining, limited lounge seating, and neutral lobby ambience. But hey, plenty of eating and socializing options nearby. Friendly front desk and overall clean environment.",8,Steve,2025-09-28

"The room was excellent, very nice, and very clean, although maybe a bit on the high side for price and amenities. The service was not good. They charged me an extra ""destination"" fee that they said was usable at the market and restaurant/bar, but didn't apply the credit on check out. They close the bar/restaurant early, and we had to sit for 20 minutes until somebody came to take our order, even though we were the only ones there. ",8,Matthew,2025-09-15
"The hotel itself was great, but the staff were quite rude to us when we checked in. The hotel bar/restaurant also closed early on all three nights of our stay.",4,Mackenzie,2025-09-15
"Room was very hot, AC didn‚Äôt work ",6,Liana,2025-09-14
"Overall, our stay was great! But the room was not worth the money we spent. The ad for Pennyweight on Expedia was wrong. At 1st on Expedia, i booked a double room with king size beds, when i called Pennyweight 2 days prior to checking in, they told me they do not offer double rooms. 2nd. The ad on Expedia also advertised ""free breakfast"", that also wasn't true. The hotel only offered breakfast that you could buy from the little restaurateur they ran as part of the hotel. 3rd, the Expedia ad also said there was ""limited on-site parking""which one would assume there is free parking on the hotel premises on a 1st come, 1st serve basis. That was also wrong. There was no ""limited on-site""parking. In fact, there was none. I had to valet my car for 3 days @ $67 a day. 4th, we forgot something in our room and realized it after we left. We asked the hotel if they could Mail it to us, and with the amount we spent on the rooms, a night, you would think they would take care of the shipping costs, that was a negative. Not that big of a deal, but still, for the money spent, thought they would've taken care of it. And lastly, a $30 destination charge everynight of our stay! I get it, taxachusstts!
They hotel is nice and the staff were great! But everything else is horrible! Small rooms, ridiculous fees, unnecessary parking costs and etc... i wouldn't stay here again nor recommend anyone else to stay here. 2 outta 5 Stars.",6,Matthew,2025-09-13

"I've never had an issue with payment before, but here we are. Paid for booking via Hotels.com, yet Pennyweight charged my card as a ""hold""?! Why? It's already been paid-for! 
One wall of our room had some strange brown substance on it. Coffeemaker didn't work. Valet parking @ $67/night rate, yet they don't tell you this--Found out via phone call. TV was impossible to use unless you know something about Dish. Not a smart TV, either, so don't think you're getting anything fancy. No channel guide. Nothing but local channels. Can't mirror your PC or even watch any of your favorite TV apps. Amentities: room-temperature mini-fridge, no microwave.
Elevators have seen better days.
Staff forced to wear green velvet suits Green. Velvet. (Pet Sematary?!) ""Free breakfast"" is actually a voucher for their restaurant. Hotels.com added a charge for breakfast, then I found out it was ""free"". No menu provided, no restaurant hours provided. Apparently, it closes at 11PM, when most people are returning from venue down the street. No idea what time it opens. You're not getting anything but pizza @ way-too-busy/loud/shady pizza joint around the corner.
Chosen for distance to venue, but not worth walking past several homeless people in the bldg directly next door, not to mention beggars who are quite brazen. 
Bed mattress was older with a pad that was too small, so it shifted. Pillows are soft with no substance. Not comfortable at all. No view except of garbage in alley next door.",6,Cheryl,2025-08-31
"The hotel was clean, modern, chic, in the lobby as well as the room I stayed in. I was especially impressed with the tiled shower with glass doors and two different shower heads! The mattress was a bit mushy, the springs were pushing into me a bit, but not awful. I appreciated the valet parking service, and the fact that it was a 3 minute walk to Boston Garden where I was going for a concert was very convenient. I just wish that they were a little more generous with the amenities. I'd think a hotel at this price point would offer a free continental breakfast. I had coffee and tea in my room, but there weren't even any paper of foam cups available to be able to take it to go. There's nothing open nearby for breakfast or coffee early in the morning, except Dunkin a couple blocks away. Every cheaper and less-nice hotel I've stayed in offered those things, including another Hilton property. I'd stay again due it's proximity to the Garden, and that it's comfy, but I'd come a little more prepared for the morning.",8,Molly,2025-08-30

"We just stayed here this past Saturday August 9th. Let‚Äôs start with price; fantastic for Boston and being so close to TD Garden (4 minutes walk if that). Walking into the lobby makes you feel really good about the value and quality of the hotel. It is clean, modern, and lively. Front desk had a line but acted effortlessly and efficiently. All smiles and welcoming. The free water for being a Hyatt member was a nice touch. Our room was on the third floor and first thing that struck us was the cleanliness of the halls and it smelled nice. Our room was easy to get into and was very clean. Zero issues with our room and the card from the person that cleaned our room was nice. Makes them accountable. Check in and check out could not have been easier. We had no issues during our stay but feel confident that the staff would have been helpful had there been any concerns. Location is safe to walk around and is convenient for TD Garden and the T. Boston Common took about 8 minutes to walk to so not bad. We will be staying here again in the future.

The only con is neither of us enjoyed the bed comfort all that much. 3.5 out of 5 stars for that but that is highly subjective. I slept ok but hopefully they upgrade before next stay. ",8,Anthony,2025-08-12

Great room and location was ideal.,10,Kristen,2025-08-04
"Me and my daughter stayed here so we could be close to the TD Garden for a concert. It was less than a 3 minute walk to the venue. It was also a short 10 minute walk to Quincy Market. Overall, we were very happy with our stay. The only few small complaints I had were they they were out of regular caffeinated coffee for the room, the water pressure in the sink was not the best and the AC unit made a lot of noise. However, all of the staff were very friendly, professional and helpful. The room was very clean and the bed was fairly comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.",8,Verified traveler,2025-08-03

"Stayed overnight for a concert at TD Bank Pavillion. After much research this hotel was one of the better rated hotels and close to the venue. 

Took the train from Portland to North Station/TD Bank Pavillion. Pennyweight Hotel was literally around the corner - 3 min walk! Lots of food options across the street.

Friendly easy check in and out. Cool vibe.  Definitely will stay here again for our next TD Bank concert.",10,Kathleen,2025-08-02

"Upon checking in we were not able to get room keys because there was a problem with making them. We were unable to close the curtains and the front desk did not know how to close them. The tv remote was missing so the valet brought up another one. The staff was very friendly, and the room was clean and updated, but it was very noisy in the hallway in the night- staff not guests. The hotel was very pretty, but typical accommodations were lacking. ",6,Jaime,2025-07-27

"The room was small, but fine.  The biggest negative is the poor lighting in the bathroom.  The lighting was so low that you could not apply the simplest makeup.  The bathroom light also went off when we showered.   Otherwise the staff was very friendly and helpful and the space was clean.",8,Susan,2025-07-16
"This is a great hotel! Super cool inside with a lot of interesting decorations! They have a bar and a little area to get some coffee/food in the morning. They also have a small store if you forget anything. The room was immaculate and the bed very comfortable. My only complaint is there were zero toiletry items beyond the standard body wash/shampoo/conditioner which is in pumps in the shower (totally fine). However for the cost, I wish they had some body lotion (I didn't bring any thinkng there would be some) and something beyond a tiny bar of soap to wash your hands. They did give you two makeup wipes. But nothing else. The room included a great coffee bar with really good coffee and a coffee maker! The TV was enormous!",10,Carolyn,2025-07-13

"Amazing, such a wonderful hotel, great location, lovely rooms. Only complaint is that if we weren‚Äôt out of our room by 10, we wouldn‚Äôt get any room cleaning and they charge a daily hotel fee so it didn‚Äôt seem right to pay for that when our bed got made once in 5 days.

"The property is in the quiet area of the West End, walking distance to North End restaurants. 

Parking, as in most other areas of Boston, is problematic. We opted for the hotel valet parking ($65 per day) and took Uber or walked. Street parking, even if you can find is spot, is not allowed overnight due to street cleaning regulations. 

The property is clean and well organized. The staff is courteous. Dining options on premisses and in the immediate vicinity are limited.

We loved the property and would love to stay again. The room was perfect and the location was amazing. The only negative I have was the valet service. Upon checkout there was only 1 person working the valet. The lobby was full of people trying to leave but unable to get their vehicles. We ended up walking with the attendant to where our vehicle was with several other guests and picked up our own vehicle. The hotel should advertise that this is how their valet service works or have the appropriate amount of attendants to fulfill the service. ,10,Wendy,2025-02-20

The Pennyweight is a great location if you want to be close to TD Garden. The street it‚Äôs on is OK although we noticed a few closed businesses. The hotel looks to be a building conversion or recent upgrade. The lobby is small but modern. Rooms are a bit tight but OK. Our view was of a mechanical shaft. The bathroom was really modern with the tile and fixture choices which we liked.  However the hot water took literally 10 minutes to warmup.  There is also no housekeeping service I think they only change bedding or provide new towels if you ask. Overall OK but could be better. ,8,Jeff,2025-02-18

"Would have been a better rating except for the fire alarm and subsequent evacuation at 1am in morning. Asked at front desk in morning and they said they had no idea what the cause was. That is not an acceptable answer. These systems are sophisticated and I'm sure the programmer has a way to determine what set off the alarm. Get it fixed

"The one outstanding thing, sadly, was the cleanliness of the coffee bar and of the refrigerator. there was no regular coffee and no condiments at all. In addition, the inside of the refrigerator was visibly dirty, and had obviously not been wiped down.
The staff was courteous, but also, seemed undermanned for the volume. ",8,Richelle,2024-12-15

"Pros:
It was clean
the area was good for walking

cons:
The rooms were VERY small and spartan
no place to put clothes except one large drawer near the door
The seat was extremely small and uncomfortable
no place to watch tv unless you were laying in bed or standing by the bed or you had to move the very small uncomfortable little chair and try to get it between the wall and the bed.
The heater/AC cycled all night every night and was very noisy which made it hard to sleep.
the road outside was noisy late into the night then again very early in the morning.

I would not recommend this place for anyone staying more than a night.
Price was very high as well.  Coffee sucked, the restaurant had limited menu.  This is the first time I have been very disappointed by a Hilton Property.  Felt like we could have stay lots of other places and had a much better value.  





















",6,Gary,2024-09-28
I would give this a 5 star stay and I would have gone lower with overall stars but the staff was incredible handling an issue we had. For the amount of money we paid- we expected more. The biggest issue was the AC in the room wasn‚Äôt working and the room temp was 84 degrees. Again- because of the staff making it right so quickly with no hesitation I would stay here again. ,8,Mark,2024-09-27

"Call the hotel before you book to see if breakfast is available. Breakfast area being renovated while we were there so no breakfast available. Expedia was going to let me book it with or without breakfast for different prices. I called hotel to ask about breakfast for 4 (expedia price only includes it for 2), and was told no breakfast available due to renovation. Hotel right around the corner from TD Garden. A four minute walk to North Station. 10 minute walk to Boston's very nice North End. Room was very nicely appointed with a safe. Some homeless people on Causeway street around corner especially at night. there is a 7-11 around corner on Causeway for drinks and snacks and a drugstore on same street as well.

CONS - I called down to the front desk and no one answered.  My room was very warm even though I had the air conditioning down to the lowest temperature which made sleeping difficult. When I came back to the hotel, they had no water for purchase and most stores were no longer open.  I had to buy soda instead (which they luckily had in stock).  There are no blow dryers in the bathroom.

PROS: I did like the bed - it was very comfortable. Room had nice decor and made good use of a small space.  Good location - walkable to everything in the North End.",6,Kathryn,2024-08-29

"Nous y avons pass√© trois nuits en juillet dernier (2024) et nous ne le recommandons pas.

L‚Äôh√¥tel √©tait en chantier, rien √† voir avec les photos. La r√©ception dans un quasi placard, pas de bar, pas de salle √† manger, pas d‚Äôautres services. La chambre √©tait belle, c‚Äôest le seul et unique point positif de notre s√©jour.

Le service √©tait ex√©crable. Nous avons eu l‚Äôimpression de d√©ranger les employ√©s tant √† notre accueil qu‚Äô√† notre d√©part. D‚Äôailleurs, l‚Äôh√¥tel est non fumeur. Quand nous avons rapport√© √† l‚Äôaccueil qu‚Äôil y avait une odeur de marijuana partout sur notre √©tage, les employ√©s pouvaient difficilement moins s‚Äôen soucier et aucune action n‚Äôa √©t√© pos√©e.

√Ä notre d√©part, leur syst√®me informatique √©tait suppos√©ment en panne. Ils ont donc refus√© de nous fournir notre facture, en nous assurant qu‚Äôon l‚Äôobtiendrait par courriel. Nous ne l‚Äôavons JAMAIS re√ßue.

Finalement, nous ne nous sommes pas senties en s√©curit√© dans les environs. On s‚Äôest m√™me fait jeter une bouteille de verre par une sans-abri √† proximit√©.

"I booked this hotel for a girls trip, celebrating my birthday weekend. I saw the photos and thought it was a beautiful property, so I booked it. Now I will say, staff were very nice and accommodating for my quite late arrival, but upon arriving, the front of the building didn‚Äôt look as advertised. We stepped in and immediately saw an area closed off for construction. As a result, many advertised amenities were not available so that was a bummer. We did enjoy our room, although the view was nothing to swoon over. Unfortunately we were right by the elevator, so that was quite loud. The room itself was nice and clean as was the bathroom. I just wish I had read other reviews so I knew what I was getting. Overall the location was fantastic, staff was nice and accommodating, and the room and bathroom were clean so I am happy.

"My room was clean, modern, and well-designed.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The whole entrance and lobby area are undergoing extensive renovation, so it is not clear what it will have to offer.  There were no dining facilities, and it is unclear whether there will be.
It is convenient to North Station, TD Garden, the North End and Faneuil Hall market, but not necessarily to breakfast.  The whole area is dominated by a new building, State Street at One Congress.  It is impressively designed, but, along with adjacent construction, seems to greatly constrict foot traffic between the train station and the city, leaving them a little dingier.  Overall, it was a fine place, but I hope that it is on the way to becoming much better.",8,John,2024-07-25

"I felt really fooled when I entered the lobby for check in. I have chosen that hotel because they said on their webpage ‚Äû welcome to our new lobby and bare area‚Äú along with some photos. When I arrived there was nothing like that on the phots on their webpage. I asked the front desk guy the next morning about that new nice bar and he admitted that the webpage isn‚Äôt right and told me that the lobby and bar is under construction. 
When I checked in the lady didn‚Äôt speak to me one sentence. She just gave me the keys without any other explanation. When we came back to the hotel after spending g the day in the city there was no room service. I don‚Äôt like the new rule that room service is only on request what I did not know because the lady at check in did not tell me. I pay full price and I want room service like it was before Covid. If I don‚Äôt want it then I put my sign out at the door. So I requested then room service for my second day and it was 3 pm or later when they knocked at the door. Then I wondered why they don‚Äôt have a coffee maker like other Hilton hotel have. The front desk guy told me that I could get one also on request. Please make sure that you have people at the check in they are willing to speak to customers and tell them all about their possible requests. The room itself was super nice and clean. But I felt so fooled & wasn‚Äôt expecting that from a hotel. If you don‚Äôt like to say the truths on your webpage then I think you don‚Äôt deserve our business. ",6,Andrea,2024-07-23
"We booked this hotel because it offered free breakfast and had family rooms with two double beds, which is what we prefer on family travels. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get neither. When we checked in they informed us that they were overbooked and did not have the room we had booked. First they offered a room with one double bed, but after us insisting that we could not sleep four people in one bed, they offered us to have two rooms, but on different floors. Not perfect on a family holiday. 

Hotel was under renovation so restaurant was closed, and they didn‚Äôt have the free breakfast they had promoted. Rooms were quite nice, but none of them were cleaned during the three days we stayed there. Didn‚Äôt get any information at check in about having to order cleaning, but the service level was probably the poorest I have ever experienced in a hotel (and I have about 30 hotel nights per year). We didn‚Äôt even get an excuse for them not being able to provide us with the room we had booked, nor were we offered any compensation. It‚Äôs unbelievable that this is a Hilton hotel.

My best advice would be to book somewhere else. ",2,Benedicte,2024-07-23

Check in employee was short and rude. The remainder of the lobby staff was at least cordial.

The hotel itself will throw you a curve ball. The lobby is no frills, the staff is fine, check-in is easy and they‚Äôll store your bags if you fly in early. The room is the star of the show. Well designed with great amount of space, technology, huge TV, and really cool space. We loved the room, just want to be clear, if you need opulent lobby and lavish bar downstairs, etc‚Ä¶you might look elsewhere. For the location, the price, and the room‚Ä¶I highly recommend.

"Virkelig l√¶kkert designerv√¶relse. Og lige s√• ul√¶kker lobby, med komplet uorganiseret og uinteresseret personale. Ingen telefon p√• v√¶relset. Meget utrygt n√•r man rejser alene som kvinde. Ingenting i minibar. Ingen badek√•be, som beskrevet p√• hjemmesiden. Intet vand p√• flaske. Intet at lave te eller kaffe med.
Hvor er det √¶rgerligt, n√•r nu man har brugt energi p√• at restaurere v√¶relserne, som faktisk er virkelig l√¶kre. Det kr√¶ver virkelig noget engagement fra ledelsen her. Vil jeg anbefale det? Nej. Ikke til den pris og fire stjerner. Det var faktisk virkelig klamt, bortset fra v√¶relset der var flot. Men som sagt utrygt uden tlf eller information om hotellet nogen steder.",4,sanne,2024-05-28

"Not a great stay. Despite booking the cleaners (yes you have to book a cleaning), they never bothered to come. 

The front desk was consistently rude, unhelpful, and overall unpleasant.

The rooms are quite small so you wouldn't want to linger long, or at least we did not, but you can't beat the convenience to the Garden and also not a long walk to the North End. There are quite a few places to eat within a block or two, as well. A few downsides: the bathroom door is mostly glass, and it doesn't lock, and there is no fan in the bathroom, and the room's windows can't be opened. Also, strangely, no hair dryer in the room, no lotion, etc, some of those usual basics are missing which was surprising for such a nice hotel. ",8,Sarah,2024-04-10

The location was convenient to shopping areas and restaurants. My only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù is that they do not have an iron or blow dryer in the room, so I had to go out with wet hair and a wrinkled shirt.

Front desk was non inviting whatsoever. No mini bar in room, just water n chips 5x over priced . No robes, shower sucked. Pipes clanging entire time in shower. No comforters or down filled anything for bedding. Best part of the stay was the valet customer service. Be glad those guys greeting customers first and are there most of night. I've been in industry for years. Felt robbed by one night stay costing over $350 especially thinking onsite restaurant and lounge, and room service as was told. Need to fully update website. Pictures must be 10 years old. Front desk was so dreary and unwelcoming, I even had to ask kid if this was place to check in. Seriously give the Valet gentlemen 5 stars hotel itself a 2 .

"We enjoyed our one night in Boston at this hotel. The rook itself was modern, clean, and nicely decorated. We easily walked to the North End and the New England Aquarium which were our priorities for our quick visit. The room was quiet as it was not on the street side of the building. Downside to that is that our view was just of another building, but not a big deal. 
The continental breakfast was fine, bagels, cereal, danish, fruit, yogurt, coffee and juice. 
Two cons stand out, the water did not get warm enough in the evening for a shower, but it was fine in the morning. So, I‚Äôm not sure what that was. And a coffee maker in the room would have been nice. But that‚Äôs minor. We got the room for $160/night which was definitely a good deal. The valet parking cost $62 which might be a bit more than area garages, but the convenience was worth it. Overall, I would stay at this hotel again. ",8,Alistair,2024-02-23

"This is a newly renovated hotel with a boutique feel. Staff are friendly and attentive. Even the valet parking guys are great. Neighborhood is one of the old ones and it is being renovated so there‚Äôs a bit of construction right now. However, you are near all sorts of fun stuff. Rooms were small but nicely appointed.

"This is the third time we've stayed at this hotel (twice in 2023, once in 2024), which is a short walk to TD Garden. I seemed to remember the property being nicer than it was this time, most notable is the lack of what has become a basic feature of most hotel rooms - a small coffeemaker. The shelves of the mini convenience store were bare, and the bar wasn't open when we returned from the game around 10 p.m. On the plus side, the shower is good and the bed comfortable (if strangely low to the ground). We likely won't be back for a fourth visit.",6,Deborah,2024-01-21

"This hotel was absolutely terrible. Upon arrival the room was freezing so we turned the heat up and left to a celtics game thinking it would be warm when we came back from the game. After returning from the game the heat still didn‚Äôt kick on and the room was freezing still. The room also had no hot water. Woke up the next morning and went to take a hot shower after a night out in Boston only to realize the water did not heat up. Left it running for well over 10 minutes and it was not even luke warm. As if this was not bad enough the valet service side swiped something in my truck and left fresh scratches all along the rear of my new truck. We had to file an incident report and are now left to deal with insurance and the valet service. Terrible hotel, terrible valet service. No idea how this is rated as a 4 star hotel. Will never stay here again and would not recommend. Spend your money elsewhere. ",2,Christian,2024-01-21

"I gave this hotel 5 stars because it really was a nice stay and the customer service was excellent.  We will come again.   The only thing I would mention is the valet running the large orange cone down the side of our truck.  It didn't do any damage and when my husband mentioned it he really had no idea what he'd done.  Since there was no damage and the valet looked at the truck with my husband to endure no damage, I kept it at 5 stars but mention so others are aware to keep watch.

The construction did not stop them from charging several hundred dollars for our room. Our room was mostly nice but there was hair in the shower and a small hairball on the bathroom floor. There was also general dust on the bathroom door window panel molding.  And about those windows on the bathroom door: when someone turns on the bathroom light in the middle of the night, the windows allow that light to flood the whole hotel room with light. They look nice but are not practical.  ",6,Sherri,2023-10-04

Overall an okay stay. Was placed in a room right above the entrance so lobby music woke me up at 7am. There was no fridge which I've never experienced in a hotel before. Some of the front desk staff were rude and got the sense that my basic request felt like a bother to them. Good water pressure and clean room though the shower head made a loud annouing squeal for duration of the shower. Comped breakfast was pretty underwhelming.

"The mattresses were in bad shape.  The fridge barely worked. There was splattered snot on the wall near the bed and on the back of the bathroom door.  The room was extremely small.  Not like it was pictured. At night when we asked for two bottles of water‚Ä¶.we were charged 12.48 on our hotel bill for them. Most places give you a bottle of water.  The continental breakfast was very good, and staff in the daytime was awesome‚Ä¶night time not ver nice.
Parking was in a garage several blocks away‚Ä¶and 49.00 for overnight.  Wow‚Ä¶kinda pricey.   It was ok, but we wouldn‚Äôt book it ever again.",8,Shirley,2023-03-29

" Loved the location.  Valet service was good.  Liked the continental breakfast.  Front desk service good, not over friendly.  Room was clean, however housekeeping service poor during stay.  Stayed three nights:  wastebaskets not emptied, towels not refreshed, had to go to front desk to ask for another roll of toilet paper and box of tissues.  During our stay, we had purchased a box of pizza.  Had to take empty pizza box to front desk to dispose of it.  Kind of embarrassing.  Noted food crumbs on hallway carpet that remained for a few days. Had a very minor coffee spill on a bed sheet .  Washed the sheet in the sink myself.  Asked the housekeeper if I could change the sheet myself.  Was told that she'd have to check with her manager, as my room was not ""on the schedule.""  I am not ever a ""complainer,"" but I was a bit disappointed, noting the cost of the room.for the nights spent.",6,Theresa,2023-03-23
The property was walking distance to the TD Garden which was our main reasoning for staying here. Everything was fine for a night. Bed was very comfy. ,8,REBECCA,2023-03-22
"This hotel was awful. The staff was not helpful, the heating system was noisy and interruptive of sleep, the phone didn't work, the refrigerator was broken, the place was threadbare. I asked if there was a room where we could have some sandwiches that we'd gotten and was told that the meeting room was broken. What could that even mean? The staff seemingly didn't really care one way or the other about the guests. I booked this room 8 months ago and the was charged at least twice what the rate at that time was. Worst hotel experience, a real rip off. Stay at the Citizen M for 1/3 of the price and even closer to TD Garden. ",2,Roberta,2023-03-22

The hotel is in a good location as far as walking to places downtown and it was close to many restaurants and bars. I didn‚Äôt like not having a coffee maker in the room and the front desk people were not very informed as to giving directions or offering a map or even where the closest visitor information was located. ,8,Laura,2023-03-20
Loved our room. It was clean and spacious. The design was lovely. The front desk staff was amazing as was the valet staff. I look forward to staying here again. ,10,Bernice,2023-03-20
"As we arrived the staff was very accommodating allowing us to store luggage.  

The issue was with the shower and the temp (scalding hot), to which I reported to the front desk.  Front desk sent up personnel to fix the problem, but in fact was not the next morning.  Still scalding hot, fluctuating on its own from that to cold water instantly.  It was made clear that they had the issue with this specifically prior to us the day before and supposedly having it fixed.  Also, the noise level until 1 am.  Surrounding area bars with music level so loud until 1 am that it was impossible to sleep.  I would like to say that again the staff tried to be as accommodating as they could possibly be.",4,Justin,2023-03-20

"The hotel staff were a bunch of young kids. I know Post-Covid it‚Äôs hard to maintain staff, but all of the staff were clearly under 25 years of age. The bed had serious broken springs in it and the pillows were like laying on 4 or 5 Kleenex‚Äôs stacked together. Only ideal piece of this Hotel is  the location. It‚Äôs right Next to TD garden and less than a mile walk to all your main attractions. ",6,Michael,2023-03-05

Put in a request for a crib. Asked again at check in was told it would be brought up. Never received a crib. The party in the room next to us had loud music blaring from 230am-530am and it smelt like weed. Doors were slamming throughout the night from this party. Two staff at front desk were in their cellphones the entire time during check out. Overall it was a nice location for walking distance to the event we had booked but will most likely look for another hotel next time. ,4,Erick,2023-03-03

"Good stay for a short trip but a very small room. No coffee maker was a bummer. The fridge was unevenly sitting in the under cabinet and therefore running very hot. Potentially unsafe. 
It was nice to have a small continental breakfast. Valet parking was nice but far too expensive. 
Also, I asked the front desk to break a $20 bill so I could tip the valet staff. They said they only had two $5 bills and couldn‚Äôt break it. Seems like somewhere there should be a way to break down cash for people.  The staff were respectful, although not very talkative. Decent value. Unsure if I would choose here again.

"The rooms are smaller than a standard hotel room and fewer windows. A basic breakfast and a small lobby for gathering between outings. Great location to TD Garden, the NE Aquarium, Faneuil Hall, shopping, restaurants, coffee shops and several T stations. We pulled up at 11 pm and the area looked a little questionable with side street lighting and next to Porter's Pub (which actually had great service and food) but this changed once we go the lay of the land. We will definitely stay here again for out next Bruins game.  ",8,David,2023-02-13

"Check in was extremely easy except for finding our room. We were just handed the keys and not told what floor. 

Elevator buttons would not work and had to be held down to work

Room was clean and cozy. The beds were absolutely aweful not just for myself but my two guests. We all slept terribly from being uncomfortable. Lamps shades had stains all over them like liquid was on them. Tv had cable and the fridge was good sized. 

Hotel had very few offerings. Only two ice machine for 11 floors of rooms. No ice buckets provide either. The complimentary breakfast was decent. Baked goods, fresh fruit, coffee, juices, cereals and more were offered.  

Check out was very quick and easy.
