"Perfect room, comfy bed. I was bracing for a poor experience with the elevators after reading other reviews, but those comments are unfair. The elevators are fast but sometimes they will stop at lots of floors. A third one would help but it‚Äôs not that bad. The longest wait we had in over a week was under 10 min. The breakfast is fine. Not the highest quality, but perfectly adequate although the plastic cutlery and paper plates would be unusual anywhere in Europe. I would stay again and recommend to friends and family.

I usually stay around Hells Kitchen but happened to find this hotel and figured I‚Äôd give it a try. The room I had was a bit larger than most others I‚Äôve seen in the city so that was a big plus! Also the kitchenette was nice to have but not very useful without the ability to actually cook anything - but I think that might‚Äôve been an error on my part. Staff was friendly and helpful. The only major snag was having issues with the WiFi the first half of my trip but that eventually was resolved. Only annoying thing was that the elevators take FOREVER! The gym was pretty decent as well. Location wise it‚Äôs just a bit far from everything but it‚Äôs a nice area.,8,Tyler,2025-09-09

"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per 9 notti con la mia famiglia e siamo rimasti molto soddisfatti. Avevamo una canera angolare al 29-esimo piano, spaziosa (per gli standard di New York), bagno.funzionale. La pulizia viene effettuata a giorni alterni e su richoesta, puo arrivare anche in orario pomeridiano (il che non √® comodo). La colazione la valuto buona, prevalentemente salata e sempre gli stessi piatti a rotazione, ma abbondante e prepatazioni buone.

The beds were very comfortable, and the breakfast was good, but in my opinion, a thermos of hot milk, various cereals (muesli), and some croissants should be added. Considering the area and the services, I found the value for money to be very good.",8,Elisa,2025-07-28
"Overall an ok stay. But paid extra for having a kitchen, but found not a single pot nor pan, no water cooker, no working coffee machine, no table to eat on. So a completely useless kitchen.

"Wir haben diese Unterkunft f√ºr eine Woche gebucht. Wir hatten ein Zimmer im 38. Stock. Die Gr√∂√üe des Zimmers war f√ºr zwei Personen perfekt. Das Bett war sehr bequem. Das Zimmer verf√ºgte sogar √ºber eine kleine K√ºchenzeile (Mikrowelle, K√ºhlschrank, Sp√ºlmaschine etc.). Das Badezimmer war sauber und modern. Bei uns lief das Wasser in der Dusche relativ langsam ab. Da m√ºsste ggf. mal nachgeschaut werden. Ein F√∂hn war ebenfalls vorhanden. Die Klimaanlage war leise und funktionierte einwandfrei. Die Unterkunft ist super zentral und direkte Anbindung an die Subway (Fulton oder Wall Street). Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war f√ºr amerikanische Verh√§ltnisse super. Es gab Bagel, Toast, Crossaint, Baguette, R√ºhrei, W√ºrstchen, Bacon, diverse Aufstriche wie Frischk√§se, Honig, Sirup etc‚Ä¶ Es gab immer frisches Obst, Joghurt, M√ºsli, S√§fte, Kaffee, Tee uvm. Um in den Tag zu Starten ist das absolut in Ordnung. Die Mitarbeiter beim Fr√ºhst√ºck haben immer direkt nachgef√ºllt sobald etwas leer war und waren sehr aufmerksam. Die Dame am Eingang des Fr√ºhst√ºcks war immer sehr freundlich. Ein gro√ües Lob f√ºr sie!! Leider ist das Geschirr aus Plastik/Pappe. ",10,Vanessa,2025-07-06

"The staff was nice but we had many issues
The smell outside the hotel was horrible
Internet slow , u have the choise to pay extra if you want faster internet. Elevator was horrible, it would take up to 30 min wait to get the elevator 
Breakfast with paper plates and plastic utensils not ideal, I got a room w kitchen but a fridge and 3 plates is not kitchen , i checked this bc the next time i wanted to visit to be able to cook something quick instead of eating outside all the time. 
Reception area to ask a question u need to wait a lot many times, phone in the room don‚Äôt even work , I had to call reception from my cell.

"Loved to room but the shower door wouldn‚Äôt stay closed in my room. The thermostat was slow to react and didn‚Äôt have heat. It got cold at night and the heat didn‚Äôt work. The elevators were pretty slow. The menu in the restaurant didn‚Äôt seem that appealing. I did try a dish, it was okay but they don‚Äôt like substitutions for your order. 

Overall it was decent, I might return. Wish they had a better menu at the restaurant and you can‚Äôt add charges to the hotel because they are separate from the hotel which sucks because of the inconvenience.

The front desk people weren‚Äôt the nicest. They seems standoff-ish and aloof energy. ",6,Riley,2025-06-02

"I stayed for a week. The front desk staff didn‚Äôt seem very eager to help and made little effort to understand me in my language. The only memorable interaction was with the young woman who assisted me at check-out.

Beyond that, everything else was as expected. The room was clean, and the dining staff welcomed guests with a smile. The elevator was extremely slow.

Overall, this is just a place to sleep‚Äîdon‚Äôt expect more.",6,Dariel de Jesus,2025-04-20

"In generale tutto molto bene, la stanza pulita (avendo anche specificato di stare attenti a questo aspetto) e molto ben curata. 

Zona valida per ogni tipo di spostamento. Esperienza ottima.

Colazione inclusa, nel mio caso, ma pessima. Unico aspetto veramente sotto tono. Poca variet√†, qualit√† bassa e davvero scoraggiante. Abbiamo fatto quasi tutti i giorni colazione fuori.

Ma nel complesso la struttura consigliata, sopratutto per la bellezza della stanza e la comodit√† della zona.",8,Alessandro,2025-04-18

"Die M√∂bel sind sehr abgewohnt. Man sollte nicht so genau in die Ecken schauen. Dort ist viel Kniest und unsaubere Handwerkerarbeiten zu sehen. Wir hatten einen Feueralarm und mussten 33 Stockwerke in der Nacht mit einem kleinen Kind nach unten laufen und dass nur, weil unsere Telefon auf dem Zimmer kaputt war und man uns und andere nicht informiert hat, dass der Alarm fail war.  In unserem Zimmer gab es, obwohl beschrieben, keine Kochplatte. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war f√ºr amerikanische Verh√§ltnisse ausreichend. Allerdings sollte man auf Umweltschutz keinen Wert legen, da es nur Einweggeschirr und Produkte gibt. Lage zu Metro ist ganz gut, aber die Gegend ist sehr verdreckt. Beim. Checkout wurde nicht einmal nachgefragt, ob es uns gefallen hat und eine Verabschiedung gab es auch nicht. Wir werden dieses Hotel nicht nochmal besuchen.

"The staff was very friendly and helpful. Parking was right next to hotel.  
Pros: room was nice and spacious. Breakfast was good with a lot of variety, showers were nice and warm, service came up right away with new sheets after our kids spilled water all over their bed.
Cons: only had 3 towels/wash clothes in bathroom (family of 4), I did receive one bath towel with a good amount of foundation on it from previous person (I did not get an opportunity to say anything about it) as it was too late when I noticed it. I‚Äôm sure they would have apologized and provided a new one, our curtains/blinds did not work properly, they were more than willing to have their maintenance guy come up but we figured we‚Äôd be out and about most of the time anyhow and didn‚Äôt want to worry about it. The breakfast silverware is prepackaged and very flimsy, it made it difficult to cut the pancakes and waffles.
Our family would definitely stay again. I feel like if you had any issues they would be more than happy to help or fix the situation.",10,Anissa,2025-04-02

Colazione, si compresa nel prezzo, ma molto piatta e ogni giorno identica, basterebbe poco per variare qualcosina. I ragazzi della reception forse per la mole di lavoro risultano poco cordiali e disponibili; inoltre ci √® stata fornita un'informazione errata per il servizio transfer aeroporto, ci √® stato proposto dalla reception a 90$ ma al nostro arrivo l'autista ci ha chiesto 130$ adducendo come motivazione il fatto che eravamo in 4 (il problema non era il costo che abbiamo pagato senza problemi, ma ci siamo sentiti presi in giro visto che abbiamo chiesto pi√π volte se il prezzo era per tutti)",6,Rosalba,2025-03-21

"Zimmer im 29. Stock mit schmalem Flussblick. Den ""Upgrade""-Preis ist das nicht wert.
Keine Kochnische wie angegeben. Ebenso kein Toaster (wie auf den Bildern abgebildet) und keine Kochutensilien. Nach Info der Rezeption haben diesen R√§umen keine Kochnische. Offenbar ein Fehler seitens Expedia. Wenn man nett nachfragt bekommt man eine mobile Kochplatte und einen Topf, eine Pfanne, ein grosses Messer und ggf. einen Pfannenwender, mehr nicht.
Die Fenster scheinen in die Jahre gekommen zu sein, denn jenes meines Zimmers war nicht ganz geschlossen und liess sich auch nicht schliessen. Daraus resultiert ein erh√∂hter L√§rmpegel und auch ein gewisser Wind, der in den Raum str√∂mt. Nach erfolglosen Reparaturversuchen des Technikers mittels Isolierband konnte ich nach 4 N√§chten ein anderes Zimmer (ohne Flussblick, 32. Stock, Hotel ausgebucht) beziehen. Hier mit integrierter Kochplatte, kein Toaster, kein Kochgeschirr, aber ruhiger - die Nachbarr√§ume h√∂rt man dennoch deutlich.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet ist typisch amerikanisch und wechselt selten, aber man hat genug zur Auswahl um t√§glich zu wechseln. 
Ein Pluspunkt ist der kurze Weg zu Lebensmittelgesch√§ften, Restaurants und auch zur Brooklyn Bridge, Wall Street oder zu den nahen U-Bahn-Stationen. Wartezeiten von 5min.   an den beiden vorhandenen Aufz√ºgen sind v√∂llig normal - Geduld mitbringen. F√ºr einen Kurzzeitaufenthalt ok.",6,J√∂rg,2025-01-09

Great amenities ( microwave, fridge, dishwasher, dishes and utensils) a full closet and 2 phones with a Bluetooth alarm clock with an accessible chargers. Unfortunately, the phone, microwave or the dishwasher didn't work. We did report the microwave but were unavailable when service arrived. We didn't notice the dishwasher & phone until the last day of our stay. Overall we enjoyed our stay. ",8,Kellye,2024-12-26

The car size was standard, so people checking in or out with luggage, only 6 or 7 fit comfortably.  The rooms and common areas were clean, the Residence Inn side of the hotel was nicely appointed.  We travel to NYC often and this will be our second choice in FiDi.",8,William,2024-12-22

Das Zimmer entspricht nicht der Realit√§t im Bezug zum Stadtblick

The girl that was attending was very nice but what a shame of administration. We end up staying in only one room for the night.
Also they don't tell me up front that the room cleaning was every other day, which I don't expect from any hotel, so if you want to have your room cleaned daily you should tell them upfront.",6,Juan Francisco,2024-12-03

"I would have rated the property higher except that upon checking in we were told there were no available rooms left in the Residence Inn due to flooding issues and were downgraded to the Courtyard hotel next door. That was not what we reserved, paid for, and expected. No kitchenette, we had to unpack and pack up again when they moved us and not as nice of a hotel. 

Both properties also have only 2 elevators, which makes one wait as long as 10 minutes for an elevator to/from the upper floors. How a 39 floor hotel has only 2 elevators is beyond me. ",8,Bill,2024-12-01

"I stayed at this property for a quick getaway with my daughter.  I did not really know The area very well and was a little bit hesitant to stay there. I was very impressed right from the beginning with the wonderful reception from the front desk staff. They accommodated all our requests and the room was very spacious, really clean, and quite large for New York standards. it was a microwave and a fridge and everything was in great working order.

We had included, but that was not really my favorite part. We were able to manage to find excellent food around the hotel just walking in the neighborhood. I also was able to sleep at night, which is a rare thing in New York City and there are not a lot of sounds all night long!

The subway station is very close and you can easily get to Midtown  within 20 minutes. The Brooklyn Bridge and the waterfront is just around the corner as well. I would definitely stay here again and I‚Äôm very grateful for the excellent service! ",10,Armand,2024-11-07

"S√©jour √† 4 avec deux enfants de 9 et 12ans. Apr√®s un s√©jour sans enfant il y a 5 ans, mon choix s'est port√© sur financial district. Vraiment sans regret c'√©tait m√™me moins bruyant, moins d'odeur et moins de mis√®re dans la rue pour les enfants. Proche de nombreux m√©tro. Avec cuisine √©quip√©e d'un micro onde, malheureusement pas de casseroles malgr√© les plaques de cuisson, d'un frigo r√©frig√©rateur, bref nous faisions nos repas du soir dans notre chambre. La fatigue de la journ√©e dans les jambes nous √©tions heureux d'aller acheter nos plats pr√©par√©s au whole food market et de manger au calme.
Nous avions le petit dej le matin. Salle au 3e √©tage, tenue par des asiatiques super discrets et souriants. Un tr√®s grand choix sucr√© et sal√© qui a convenu √† toute la famille. Toujours de la place dans la salle que l'on arrive √† l'ouverture ou m√™me plus tard. Rarement d'attente √† l'ascenseur malgr√© notre chambre au 38e √©tage.

- breakfast is the same every single day, not a single change in the food offer for our 9 night stay.

The loud music kept us well late into the night (2-3am), so we didn't get a good nights sleep. Again, we had a very good trip and and the proximity of the hotel was perfect for our itinerary.

Overall the property and staff was good, the elevator had a bit of wait time most times and the room service could do with some improvement (the bed linen I believe wasn‚Äôt changed when we got the room as it had an unpleasant odor but was noticeably fresh and without that odor when it was changed on the 4th day of our stay).

,10,Francisco,2024-09-05
The property was very noisy due to ongoing construction. Our room phone didn‚Äôt work when we tried to contact the front desk. We didn‚Äôt have any utensils in our room and we couldn‚Äôt even contact them because the battery pack on the phone was dead. I attempted to use the hallway phone and that didn‚Äôt work either. I had to go all the way down (30 floors) to the lobby and request silverware. They brought plastic utensils. We also requested maid service and they didn‚Äôt even provide us with soap. This was terrible service and not something you would expect from Marriott. ,6,SERGIO,2024-09-05
Great stay for NYC. The property was clean and large for NYC. It was in a walkable area with a lot of things to do and food options. A great choice if you are going to check out lower manhattan and Brooklyn. ,10,Brianna,2024-09-05

The worst was the dinning room stuff all wearing their own individual T-shirt and runners, speaking, Mandarin or Cantonese gossiping about hotel customers. ",6,Yue,2024-09-01

"Staff were very helpful. Room was small but clean and housekeeping was intuitive and respected privacy. Two surprises were I was expecting a small cooktop in the kitchenette but there was just a microwave so the kitchenette isn‚Äôt really functional for proper meal preparation and the elevator wait time was very long. There are many family parties with several people which exacerbated the congestion. I don‚Äôt think i left my room in order to avoid dealing with it. They didn‚Äôt give me a problem bringing my bike up which was really appreciated.

Also phone didn‚Äôt work, door was partially jammed, and battery on the safe was low. In informed maintenance but it wasn‚Äôt resolved. The maintenance guy was lovely though i think it was just the end of his shift. 

The view from the room was great. Overall I would return again if there was a sale.",8,christopher,2024-08-12

"Hotel was nice. Once we checked in they had said our specific room wasn‚Äôt available anymore but said they would change the price that was charged which we were ok with. Also, property states parking which is the main reason we picked this hotel and the lot was full so we ended up parking two blocks away in the absolute pouring rain for $150 for two nights. Breakfast was good and didn‚Äôt try the restaurant. Room was clean and quiet. ",8,Juan,2024-08-11
The location was superb but the property is in need of maintenance and upgrades. We got stuck in the elevator and then it completely stopped working the following day. We were on floor 27 of Residence Inn and had to take the exit staircase down to floor 26 where it connected with the Courtyard Marriott in order to utilize their elevator to get to and from our room. One night we smelt some sort of gas odor in the air conditioning and couldn‚Äôt even call down to the lobby because there were no phones present in the room. We had to open the window while we got the technician from the lobby. ,6,Verified traveler,2024-08-11

Was eventually moved to the same floor as my other booking, but that room did not have a cooktop. They did inform me about it.

"- When we tried to check in at 3:00 pm, Henna has told us to wait for 10 minutes because our is not ready yet. After 10 minutes I asked her again and she said to wait again. Then in another 10 minutes, I asked one more time another girl at the reception and she has told us that we have to wait in order to get an upgraded room (like cmon??? We didn‚Äôt even knew anything about the upgrade). For the upgraded our room they said that we have to wait additional 30-40 mins and we DID NOT want it. This is our only day in NYC. Once we told her that we weren‚Äôt even acknowledged about the upgrade and we don‚Äôt want it, finally they let us be in our room.

"Overall the hotel is fine, just a few comments for further improvements:

1 - some of receptionists might be more open and friendly. They really seemed to be annoyed every time we asked a question or info.

2 - the room is fine, however heating and fridge are extremely noisy; no way to have a quite night with such items on. We had to turn fridge and heating off over night. 

3 - breakfast is too poor, and it‚Äôs mainly eggs based. It might be ok for a few days, however on the long distance it would be nice to have more options.

4 - lift waiting sometime takes too long. It‚Äôs strange that only two lifts per side are available. ",8,Maurizio,2024-04-04

I was able to request a toaster for the room which was great! FiDi is a nice quiet area to stay and subways + the east river and WTC are easily accessible. Rooms were reasonably quiet but you could hear people talking through the air vents. Overall nice hotel, great service and I‚Äôd stay again: ",10,Caroline,2023-11-19

"I travel to NYC 5-10 times per year, this was the worst hotel experience I've had here, or anywhere.  I strongly recommended not staying in this hotel until they are able to meet the standards of what you would expect from a Marriott.  My concerns with the cleanliness of my room led me to cancel the remaining days of my reservation and move to another hotel. This was at my expense since Marriott wasn't able, or willing, to move me to another location.",2,Verified traveler,2023-11-13

The hop-on hop-off bus access was a few blocks away and got us to the other areas we wanted to see. There were plenty of dining options, including breakfast, nearby and only wish we had taken more advantage of our kitchenette as the hotel breakfast, though sufficient, not worth the additional cost.

I broke my ankle and was in a boot and scooter they were not accommodating at all! We were leaving for the airport and after waiting for the elevator for 30 minutes one finally stopped on our floor and it had two cleaning staff of it, we asked if they would please allow us to have the elevator for us (family of 4) and all of our luggage that we were on the way to the airport. They refused got get off the elevator so we just threw our luggage on top of their cleaning carts and made our way onto the elevator otherwise we would have missed our flight. It took 45 minutes to get from our room to the curbside. I didn‚Äôt even check out. I do not recommend this hotel at all! ",2,DLana,2023-09-26

breakfast was okay, not too much variation but still tasty. Hotel staff was friendly and the rooms were clean and tidy. The room size was okay for two people. A little more storage in the form of a drawer or something would have been great.

El hotel en s√≠ est√° bien, la habitaci√≥n de un tama√±o normal para una pareja con una cama extragrande y c√≥moda. Dispone de una mini cocina sin placa de cocci√≥n,con micro, fregadero, armarios, lavavajillas, mini frigo y vajilla justita para 2 personas. Armario empotrado con tabla y plancha. El  ba√±o tiene una ducha con alcachofa fija y buen flujo de agua con buena temperatura regulable.Tambi√©n hay aire acondicionado, que el personal de limpieza nos dejaba todos los d√≠as puesto a 18 grados, parec√≠a el polo norte, suponemos que ser√≠a para ventilar porque no abren las ventanas.
La habitaci√≥n supuestamente nos la iban a limpiar a d√≠as alternos y como algo excepcional, pero muchos de esos d√≠as s√≥lo nos hac√≠an la cama, retiraban basura y cambiaban toallas, se notaba que no limpiaban.En el ba√±o hay secador y productos de higiene, aunque a veces se olvidan de reponer, pero en recepci√≥n intentan solucionarlo.El wifi no iba bien, lento y con problemas.
Respecto al desayuno, en los 12 d√≠as que hemos estado alojados no ha cambiado absolutamente nada. Se agot√≥ el t√© negro y no ten√≠an para reponer. No hay pan, ni embutido, siempre los mismos yogures, manzana y pl√°tano de fruta y boller√≠a grasienta y de mala calidad.

Good breakfast options and appreciated the luggage drop-off option. Had to use our room key to go anywhere in the elevator so we felt safe staying there. ,8,Julie,2023-09-07
"Staff was exceptional.  A special commendation should be made for ""Hannah"" who helped us with our bags the first day, and for ""Tracy"" who showed us hospitality every morning at breakfast.

Hannah made sure we had a place to secure our bags, and she saw to it that we were able to check in as early as possible.  Tracy also was very hospitable every morning at breakfast, and she even helped us figure out how to navigate the subway for our day's activities.  Great job, and we will be back!",10,Todd,2023-09-06

The breakfast buffet is great! Everything you could want - eggs, omelettes, pancakes, waffles, turkey or veggie sausage patties, oatmeal, fruit, bagels, etc.
Can't beat the location - lots of great restaurants in walking distance, not far from subway, and close to One WTC and Tribeca.

"The included breakfast is a good addition - last year we stayed at the the Marriott Residence Inn World Trade Center and their breakfast has a better variety also an excellent Starbucks coffee machine and juice machine, complete with choices for mineral water, apple, orange etc.
When we arrived, there were no cooking utensils for the stove in our kitchen - no spatula, tongs - only one setting of silverware.
Pans were there and when we asked for a spatula, they brought me a frying pan? One Ice machine in the cellar was out of order, and we had to asked for plastic trash bags for all the trash cans - I can‚Äôt imagine throwing egg shells right into a can that wasn‚Äôt lined! No wine glasses either.
It was good to have the garage right next door and a discount for ticket validation. 
When we asked the front desk staff for dinner idea locations in the area, the reply was ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt live in this area so I‚Äôm not really sure‚Äù.  This was not very helpful. 
We were able to check our luggage safely downstairs until our room was available which helped.  
Lastly all the rooms on our floor were no smoking rooms and the elevator / hallways / and lobby at times smelled like pot.

The property was not really inviting. Room was clean but limited dining spots. Area had construction and the city needs to clean up area. The amount of trash gave the area a horrible smell. The phone did not work in my room and if there was an emergency there was no convenient way of making a call due to the hallway phone not being active. To get ice in the cellar is not attractive for paying guest. There should be a service provided even if it‚Äôs to charge a fee of 5 dollars to obtain ice.

"I stayed for two weeks in a King Studio, party of two, and we really enjoyed the amenities and the included breakfast. The latter is an unpretentious but generous buffet, varied enough to cater to different tastes and dietary needs, that you take in a spacious lounge on the 3rd floor. Good coffee both in the room and at breakfast. On the ‚Äúcellar‚Äù floor there are ice dispensers and a laundry room where you can do your own washing and drying for $1 per load.

The room and bathroom were very clean. Toilet paper and in-room coffee/tea were not refilled by the service staff, we had to ask for that, but the refills came without delay. One cleaner (perhaps someone who was new?) seemed unaware that there was a trash bin in the cabinet under the sink, so we had to ask that it be picked up later that day. I didn‚Äôt see a way to call the front desk; when you dial the front desk it‚Äôs constantly busy. The front desk staff was super-friendly and helpful.

I loved the location. It‚Äôs a stone‚Äôs throw from the seaport and an easy walk from the World Trade Center, subways, buses, the esplanade, and more.

"Dejligt hotel beliggende centralt p√• lower Manhattan t√¶t p√• Wall street. Hotellet har store veludstyrede v√¶relser og internet virker godt. Reng√∏ringen kunne dog virke lidt sjusket. Morgenmaden var udm√¶rket, men med begr√¶nset udvalg, f√• siddepladser og engangsservice. Alt i alt var hotellet v√¶rd at bes√∏ge, selv om prisen alt taget i betragtning er h√∏j.",10,Martin Stampe,2023-04-14
"Las instalaciones en general y la situaci√≥n del hotel result√≥ bueno. El desayuno para varios d√≠as es muy corto de elecci√≥n, estuve once d√≠as y al tercer o cuarto d√≠a ya est√°s cansado de repetir. La limpieza de los pasillos no se realizaci√≥n regularidad,. Los utensilios de cocina son pocos e insuficientes. Algunos empleados del Lobby solo entiende el ingles",8,Juan Jos√©,2023-04-13

"We paid for an upgraded double queen bed corner room via Expedia months in advance. I called the day before to confirm our reservation as well. When we arrived, that room was not available so they gave us two king bed rooms (fine, but one of us had to sleep all alone). Only one of the rooms was available though and they said they would  call us when the second room was ready. 3:00pm normal check in time rolled by, 4:00, then 5:00.  At that point we had to get into at least one room to prep for dinner reservations and a show.   We readied ourselves and on the way out at 6:00, the 2nd room was finally available so we grabbed keys for it at front desk.  When we came back later that evening, we found out the tv in the 2nd room because the router for the internet wasn‚Äôt working. We tried to call down to from desk but the phones in the rooms (both rooms) did not work either.  We also had issues with the door locks working properly with the keys.  We continually had to get new keys.  I tried to let them know about the tv/router issue and they gave me a number to call for IT.  When I called, IT said it was a hotel issue.  Needless to say, we just watched our phones in bed and didn‚Äôt use hotel phones to call down for issues. I will be contacting Expedia and/or the hotel I. Regards to the ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù I paid for that wasn‚Äôt recieved. ",4,Katie,2023-04-03

"The staff was great and helpful.  

Our room was clean and nice but seemed to be next to the elevator equipment room for the adjacent property (#2801), so we often have elevator noise.  the bathroom was smaller than what I was used to at other locations, but this too could/would be an NYC thing. 

Breakfast was decent with a good selection. 

The room was not much of a ""city view"" per the room selection (but I guess when you are surrounded by tall builds this can happen).  

Easy access to attractions in the FiDi and lower Manhattan area.  Easy access to the subway (just a few blocks away).  ",8,Todd,2023-03-14

"Staffs were very friendly and helpful, especially at check in. Room was nice and clean. A little smaller than expected but comfortable. Complimentary breakfast included but we never made on time. Lots of eating place and ferry walking distance from hotel. Enclose parting for $40per day",10,Nathalie,2023-02-25
