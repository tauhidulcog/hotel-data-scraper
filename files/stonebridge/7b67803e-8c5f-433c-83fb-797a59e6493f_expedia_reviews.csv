Unser Aufenthalt war rundum perfekt und ein sehr gelungener Urlaub.,10,Charlotte Vivien,2025-10-07
"Great continental breakfast.  Stay in first few floors , as elevators during breakfast/ checkout take an extremely long time(45 minutes). Super friendly.  If driving in- do valet just for convenience",10,Janice,2025-10-05

"Chambre très propre, personnel agréable, proximité de Times Square irréprochable vraiment pratique et accessible pour tout.
Seul point négatif le petit déjeuner: une salle trop petite pour le nombre de clients, petit déjeuner peu varier et ne propose ni de chocolat chaud ni petit déjeuner avec du chocolat même pas du Nutella ou sauce chocolat pour les gaufres ou encore de céréales ou muffin au chocolat. À part des œufs, des saucisses et des galettes de pommes de terres ainsi que des baggels ou du pain de mie il n’y avait malheureusement pas grand chose",8,Orlane,2025-10-03
"The staff were courteous and very helpful
Rooms were clean but the corridor in the floor I stayed wasn't vacuumed much

Overall a great experience because it is very close to Times Square and area",10,Francisco,2025-10-03
"Schone kamer, locatie is top. Airco maakt redelijk wat geluid maar is met oordopjes in goed te doen.
Ontbijt is inderdaad hectisch, maar prima te doen",6,Claudia,2025-10-02
"Location eccellente a un passo da Time Square.Bella camera anche se molto piccola ma con tutto il necessario, angolo cottura senza fornelli. Colazione scarsa , mancano dolci formaggi prosciutto; troppo americana.
Latte freddo senza possibilità di scaldarlo in loco; dovevi tornare in stanza e scaldarlo nel microonde.Sistema dell ascensore moderno ma in alcuni momenti molta attesa.
Nel complesso valido per una breve vacanza.",8,enrico,2025-10-02
"Excelente ubicación si quieres ver lo más icónico de NY. Cerca están varias estaciones de metro y todo tipo de comercios.

"Staff was amazing.  The room was clean for the most part. The shower could have used a deeper clean.  The bed was comfortable.  My only complaint is the elevators.  It was acting a little weird when we got there and it was hard to get an elevator during the busy hours.  Other than that, the location was perfect if you want to be close to everything in Times Square.  Catching the subway was easy to get to other places.  I'd stay here again.",8,Primrose,2025-10-01

"We felt safe, rooms was clean and friendly staff. We had 1 complaint....we are a big college football family, when we went back to the Hotel for the night t o watch our favorite football team play...we could only get 2 channels on the TV, when we called the front desk we were told the entire hotel was experiencing the issue. 
Unfortunately we had an underage son with us and could not go to a bar to watch the late game. Fur us, that was quite disappointing.

"The location was perfect for getting around the immediate area and walking distance to main attractions.  Room was quiet.  Front desk staff was excellent and responded to requests immediately.  Not too impressed with housekeeping staff but other than that, would recommend.",8,CYNTHIA,2025-09-23
"After an extremely disappointing experience at the Belvedere Hotel, I walked up the street to Home2 Suites by Hilton, and the difference was night and day. From the moment I stepped inside, I was welcomed with genuine kindness and professionalism.
The team was appalled by the treatment I had just endured and assured me that at Home2 Suites, they always strive to work with guests when there’s any sort of miscommunication. That spirit of true hospitality was evident right away.
A special thank you goes to Meriton, whose help and professionalism turned a stressful situation into a positive experience. He went above and beyond to secure a great room for me and made sure I felt comfortable and cared for.
Home2 Suites embodies what hospitality should be—warm, accommodating, and guest-focused. I highly recommend this hotel and cannot thank Meriton and the staff enough for turning my trip around.",10,Robin,2025-09-22

"Room 515
The Good:
The location of this hotel is fantastic, the front desk staff was amazing, and the room itself was clean and comfortable for 2 people. I really enjoyed having a full-size fridge. We ordered from Instacart to stock our fridge during a week stay and it was perfect.
The morning breakfast was hot and pretty good.

The Bad:
The smart elevators aren't so smart. They really should implement a system that asks how many passengers when the floor is selected. We waited long times for elevators and often they were full when they arrived. I am a Hilton honors member and checked in through the app requesting a room on the second floor as I had read reviews about the elevators taking a long time and wanted to have easy access to the stairs if need be. Upon getting to the hotel at 430pm, I was told that my original room that I requested was not yet clean and it could be up to 2 MORE hours before it was ready. This is NOT acceptable....we had already been in town since 10am and were ready to relax so I took the next lowest floor option which was room 515...and of course we experienced the long wait times and ended up walking the 5 flights of stairs on multiple occasions.
There was something next to our room that sounded like a vacuum was running 24 hours a day and the Hard Rock sign across the street kept plenty of light in our room overnight! The darkening shade did not help as the light crept around the edges and illuminated our entire room. ",4,Sabrina,2025-09-19

Very central hotel and the free breakfast was great! :),10,Hailey,2025-09-15
"I chose the hotel because of its location. Night one at 9pm, I asked for extra towels as they only clean the room every other day. Also asked for a shower cap for my wife. Man arrived at 930 with the towels, did not bring shower cap. I asked him about it, he said “ I will go get it” he never came back. 30 mins later the woman from the front desk called the room to ask me “has you stuff arrived” I told her towels yes, not the shower cap. She said i” I’ll get it right up to you”;30 mins later I received another call, now 10:35 pm. I told her the story, she said I’ll get it up to you. Never arrived. Next day I go to the lobby, the man in charge makes some really bad excuses! Then my T.V. Does not work in the room, after an hour and a half trying to fix it, guy brings in new coaxed cable and 2 guys lift TV off the wall and then it works!! To go down to get breakfast on Sat and Sunday we waited over 30 minutes for the elevators! Was terrible",2,JEFF,2025-09-15

"Fantastic location , has 4 dedicated lifts (which are needed) due to the volume of guests and cleverly work in conjunction with your key card. At peak times you may have a very long wait (as experienced - 20 minutes to get from 31st floor
To lobby with no choice to use stairs as had luggage. Room was really good , staff were really good when communicated with, some building works adjacent which meant stopping to drop off luggage had to be timed well with no other vehicles with this being a fairly busy used road and one way street to be able to stop and then get luggage out without causing a drama of a holdup. But to be clear this is a positive review hotel great location and would definitely use again if going back to NYC",8,Andrew,2025-09-14
Toda la habitación muy bonita adaptada con lavatrastos  refrigeradora entre otros accesorios de cocina; recomendaría que también pusieran en el baño la gorra para la ducha como también una lima pequeña se unas unos algodoncitos para limpieza facial ,8,Jeny Mayari Pineda,2025-09-14
"Great location for theatre district. Don’t pay extra for city view. We got a “city view” of the street below and a glimpse of M&M store in Time Square. Why does most hotels provide soft unsupported pillows? They sucked. Also the air didn’t seem to work. Could only take down to 68, but kept going to 70 without us doing anything. This made the room pretty uncomfortable with the humidity.",8,Ryan,2025-09-13

Loved the location!! It's an Absolutely Terrific locale in the Heart of Anything and Everything you could possibly want to do or see in NYC 🍎!! I called twice for assistance with the AC control and both times I had an engineer in my room in less than 10min😃!!

"My family of 3 really enjoyed this stay for our trip to New York! The hotel check in was great with added charm from Nicholas our concierge. The queen suite was well equipped with kitchen supplies, pull out sofa bed, all the streaming services on TV and lots of counter space to keep things organized! The American style breakfast every morning is above average and there’s waffles/pastries downstairs too; which we missed the first day so be sure to go downstairs as well as the main lobby floor dining room, the earlier the better. The best thing is the location, can’t beat staying in the heart of Times Square, walking distance to everything! The negative Nancy’s will say that the elevator is slow and the breakfast is average, well they’re only half right lol, since I’ve already mentioned the breakfast; are you really going to let a slow elevator ride be the reason you turn down a great place to stay?! We strategically stayed on a lower floor and that helped with catching the elevator so, Overall 9/10 and I’d definitely stay again :) ",10,Erika,2025-09-05

"Bought a package with breakfast. Conveniently 1 elevator was running during peak breakfast hours. People were waiting close to an hour for an elevator and missed breakfast.

"Hotel in pieno centro, vicinissimo a time square. Comodo anche per la metropolitana. Camera silenziosa e comodissima, con angolo cucina dotato di microonde, lavandino e lavapiatti. Al mattino capita di dover aspettare a lungo l'ascensore, anche 10 o 15 minuti, nonostante il fatto che siamo molti e ben organizzati su prenotazione, consiglio di uscire per tempo! Colazione ottima e varia!!",8,Margherita,2025-09-03
"La habitación no estaba 100% limpia, una rollo de papel toalla tenía residuos de sangre como si un drogadicto uso la habitación y se inyectó y usó el papel toalla para limpiar la aguja, por otra parte la cama en su contorno estaba pólvora y habían chapas de bebidas en el suelo que durante la estadía no se levantaron! 

La regadera no estaba nada aseada !

"Difficile à noter. Pour le positif, l'hôtel est situé à côté de Times Square et est placé idéalement pour visiter New York. Les chambres sont confortables et assez grande pour deux. Mais...
Le bruit de la ventilation (pas la clim) est insupportable (prévoir des bouchons d'oreilles pour dormir). On nous a proposé de changer de chambre...sans garantie de mieux.
L'hôtel est en surcapacité : l'attente des ascenseurs peut être vraiment longue. Vraiment très longue. Pour le petit déjeuner, par ailleurs très bien fourni, s'y rendre après 7h devient une foire d'empoigne et c'est chacun pour soi pour trouver une table. Pas très zen au réveil.
Au final, un bilan contrasté, même si notre séjour à New-York reste inoubliable.",6,Manuel,2025-08-28
The staff was amazing.,10,April,2025-08-28
The sofa bed made a lot of noise and I could feel the springs form the mattress. It was really uncomfortable. Also the noise outside was bit loud. The windows didn’t actually cancel the noise.,6,Harshal,2025-08-28
The hotel is in a good location. The rooms are cleaned every 2nd day. The breakfast lacks variety and the seating area is always busy. If you have luggage its a long wait for the elevators ( we waited 20 mins on check in day and 20 mins on check out day),8,Shahenaz,2025-08-28

"El hotel está en una muy buena ubicación, muy cercano al Times Square y a las principales paradas de metro. 
Las habitaciones para tres, aunque no son muy amplias, a mi parecer son más que correctas, cierto es que el sofá cama no es muy cómodo, pero en nuestro caso no nos ha supuesto un problema.  
En cuanto al desayuno es caótico por el espacio pequeño y demasiada gente, pero siempre terminas encontrando una mesa. 
Sobre los ascensores no puedo opinar ya que nosotros solicitamos una planta lo más baja posible para evitar largas esperas, pero realmente en horas puntas sí que vimos que estaba muy concurrido.
El Rooftop de la planta 32 tiene unas buenas vistas. 
Otro punto positivo que siempre en recepción hubiera café y una máquina con un batido de vainilla buenísimo!

"Staff at reception were very friendly and helpful. We liked that breakfast was included. The dining halls and elevators got very busy at breakfast time but we were able to find a place to sit everyday. I liked that this is one of the few places in the area with a basic kitchenette (microwave, small fridge and dishwasher, basic cutlery and dinnerware- you could even request a hot plate I believe). There was a twin sofa bed in the room which worked well because I was with my two teens. Housekeeping cleaning was mediocre. The only thing we found a bit odd was that there was a fan in the room that runs 24 hours which was quite loud and then when the A/C kicked in it was double the noise. I had to get earplugs for one of my children because the noise was making it difficult for them to sleep. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would probably stay here again. ",8,Hannah,2025-08-21

The hotel is modern and clean and the location the best. I still can recommend it. ",8,martha,2025-08-20

"Considerati i prezzi richiesti dalle altre strutture per fare colazione, questo compensa la scelta un po' limitata dei prodotti offerti nella colazione stessa.
Si consiglia di fare colazione presto prima delle ore 7:00 in quanto nell'ora di punta dalle 8:00 alle 10:00 salire e scendere con gli ascensori diventa complicato nei tempi di attesa sia al piano della camera che al piano terra, perché l'hotel è sempre molto affollato.",10,Paolo,2025-08-20

Colazione in 12 giorni di soggiorno sempre la stessa, diciamo molto basica…a me va bene perché non ho molte pretese però le brioches o delle torte le ho trovate ovunque ma, la cosa grave era l’assembramento, sala colazione troppo piccola per il numero di persone che affluiscono, hanno aggiunto una mezza sala al piano interrato ma metà è adibita a magazzino lenzuola, mancano molte cose e quindi devi salire e scendere le scale per andare al buffet del piano di sopra.

Staff was very helpful and got us a shuttle to the airport for a discounted rate. The only downside was the elevators were down for one of the days but it was fine. Overall 9/10 ",10,Rose Marie,2025-08-13

"Except to wait for the elevator for at least an hour each time. Once you go down in the morning don’t plan to go back up. 
Our room wasn’t finished being cleaned during the day. Came back to no sheets and cleaning products still in the room. Took an hour and a half to get sheets. 

But the location is prime Times Square and clean. ",6,Keana,2025-08-12

Localização perfeita para ficar bem no centro de Manhattan e ao mesmo tempo sofrer com o tumulto da Time square. O cafe da manha é sensacional. Tem varias estacoes de metro por perto e com opções para diversos pontos turístico.  Voce consegue sair do aeroporto JFK e sair numa estação que fica a 3 minutos a pé do hotel.,10,Luis Felipe,2025-08-10
I had a handicapped room and the bed was too low and the air conditioning was not working properly.  It was hot and humid in the room. The maintenance guy came and adjusted the thermostat but the ac never got cold enough to remove the humidity. I paid for a city view room but this wasn’t what I wanted.  Also the elevator system was trash! Elevator was always full and it took at least 10-20 minutes just to get to the lobby or classroom.,6,Verified traveler,2025-08-10

Fica a 30 passos da Times Square mas o ap é silencioso. Não espere um “HILTON” - é um primo mais humilde. O café da manhã é bem servido e com opções mas lotado e descer de manhã tarefa árdua já que os elevadores nitidamente não dão conta. O hotel foi recondicionado para centenas de apartamentos menores. Tente ficar num andar baixo para descer de escadas. Ou muito alto para pegar o elevador na largada. Front desk atencioso. Limpeza ok. Perto das estações de metrô - fácil acesso à tudo. ,6,Conrado,2025-08-09
"- Wir waren 4 Erwachsene + 1 Kind und hatten 2 Zimmer. Die Klimaanlage/Lüftung war in beiden Zimmern derart laut und man konnte diese nicht abschalten. 

- Die Fahrstuhlsituation ebenfalls katastrophal. Wir waren im 32. Stock. Und wir mussten teils derart lange auf einen Fahrstuhl warten, sodass wir mit den Treppen schneller waren. 

- Die Frühstück-situation war ebenfalls unterirdisch. Viel zu viele Gäste und viel zu wenig Platz. Zusätzlich zu wenig Personal um aufzuräumen. Wenn man einen Tisch ergattern wollte, musste man die Tische selbst abräumen und sauber machen. Ansonsten keine Chance. Neben den Tischen haben die Leute quasi schon darauf gewartet bis man aufsteht und den Tisch frei macht. ",4,Christian,2025-08-09

"Hotel centrale a pochi passi da Time Square. La camera era pulita e confortevole, l’angolo cottura ben attrezzato e il letto veramente comodo. La colazione è varia e le uova sono squisite. Viene servita dalle sei alle dieci, ma conviene andare presto perché la sala è meno affollata. Il caffè è bollente e buonissimo. Il deposito bagagli è gratuito così come la Wi-Fi, molto veloce e la TV 55 pollici con moltissimi canali. Ai piani sono presenti distributori di acqua potabile, indispensabili! L’aria condizionata funziona bene anche se le ventole sono un po’ rumorose. Personalmente non mi hanno dato fastidio. I prodotti da bagno sono contenuti in comodi dispenser, troverete sapone, shampoo, balsamo, doccia schiuma, crema per il corpo. Il phon ha una buona potenza.

"The biggest challenges were by far the elevators, and the number of people competing for space to eat at the complimentary breakfast each morning. With respect to breakfast, the hotel gave out a handout that said if we arrived for breakfast between 6 and 8 AM, we would have a better chance of beating the crowds as opposed to 8 to 10 AM when the crowds are the highest, so that was manageable. The elevators were completely different story. There were times when we found ourselves waiting for an elevator for upwards of five to eight minutes until an elevator finally arrived on our floor. Bear that in mind if you have the option of staying on a lower floor as opposed to a higher floor, as you may find yourself taking the stairs just to avoid some of the elevator rides.

The staff was very friendly, and very attentive to our requests sent through the Hilton text service. Zero complaints on the cleanliness of the hotel, and our room on the 33rd floor was very quiet.",6,Beth,2025-08-01

The elevators were small and not efficient at all. Constantly over filled and had to wait 15-20 minutes from our floor to the lobby. Really frustrating with only being able to use assigned elevator. Then they would be over filled and had to get reassigned and wait again. I would not go back to this hotel for that alone. ,6,Kirsten Lynn,2025-07-26
It was a great stay they gave me the option of a higher or lower floor. It felt really safe cant access elevator unless you have a key card. Free breakfast included.

"Hilton,  a very prostegic hotel name. The 2 negatives are, the calling for the lift service, you could wait sometimes up to 30 minutes or who would like to walk up or down 38 floors. Breakfast times were a nightmare. 3 breakfast sittings and a nightmare to get somewhere to sit. People walking about with hot drinks and food. People standing to eat breakfast. A further small space down in the basement, where laundry was kept. Not sure if it was clean or dirty laundry. Or you could choose to take food to your room, but by the time you got there, your food & drinks would be cold. Who wants to get into a packed lift with your breakfast?  A  health & safety issue, i would think? Not enough space for the capacity of people and rooms. The staff were very friendly, helpful & accomadating. ",6,Lindarose,2025-07-25
"Fresh, modern accommodations. Everything was comfortable. The elevators are ridiculous though. They had a smart elevator system where you had to scan your cars, select your floor number, and it would tell you which elevator to get in but they were frequently full and inaccurate. This issue was reported several times so hopefully they’ll find a solution. 
The location was perfect. Steps away from everything. I would definitely stay here again. ",8,Lisa,2025-07-25

Second issue - there was nowhere to sit at breakfast. I gave up and took my cereal back to my room. 

There’s just too many floors in this hotel (36 or so) and not enough infrastructure to support them (elevators and seating areas.) You don’t get a big footprint in Manhattan and this hotel overbuilt on theirs.",4,Kurt,2025-07-17

Room was small and the only negative was the air conditioner didnt go below 70 and we like it cold in our room at night. Location wise, its near everything.

"This hotel was a great location. The major issue is the elevator system.  There were several large groups that arrived while we were there.those of us who were already staying there coukd not get thru and onto elevators due to the congestion. Thenn because of the way the elevator security system is designed, if you made it on, they would often stop at  every floor , and there was no way to bypass it.  It seems that having an elevator attendant, as they do for the rooftop bar , would make more sense at times of heavy cingestion. . You need to allow an extra 15 minutes just to get down from your room if you are in a time schedule. ",8,Robyn,2025-07-12
"Room was clean and well stocked, check in was good, but the wait for the elevator was awful. We ended up taking the stairs from the 31st floor, several times. The breakfast is a disaster.

It was right in the middle of everything- so if you are looking for that- it was a great location. We booked here to have a functioning kitchen- and although we could get an element for cooking they did not supply any pots to cook with. We were given one small fry pan- so had to work with that. I found the breakfast area always packed and the downstairs was very run down and set amongst the laundry. Also our toaster was shooting out smoke so we couldn’t use it. And the roll out desk/table was broken and we needed to ask three days in a row before someone came to fix it. I don’t think I would stay here again. ,6,Laurie,2025-07-11

Clean. Friendly staff. Safe. GREAT location easy walk to Times Square etc. Breakfast was hectic but they kept bring out trays of food. We had a great stay! ,10,September,2025-07-11
"The room was clean, the furniture was in good condition, and overall everything was well-maintained. However, the mattress had a noticeable sag in the middle and had lost its firmness. This caused an uncomfortable sleeping experience, as it felt like you were sinking into a “parenthesis-shaped” position during the night.

Breakfast was tasty with a decent variety. The elevator was often crowded, which was slightly inconvenient.
But the most concerning issue for me — as someone with dietary sensitivities — happened at breakfast. The scrambled eggs were labeled simply as such, but I noticed pink pieces of meat in them. When I asked the kitchen staff, they casually replied that it was pork and saw no problem with it. The lack of clear labeling and sensitivity around this issue was disappointing.

For guests with specific dietary or religious needs, this kind of oversight can completely overshadow an otherwise pleasant stay.",8,Deniz,2025-07-11

"Die Unterkunft war insgesamt gut. Die Lage ist wirklich perfekt für Sightseeing in Midtown. Der Times Square ist direkt um die Ecke und viele Sachen fußläufig erreichbar. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist auch in Ordnung. Die Zimmer sind für drei Personen nicht sehr groß, aber man ist sowieso die ganze Zeit unterwegs, so dass dies nicht so dramatisch ist. Geduld sollte man beim Aufzug mitbringen. Zu Stoßzeiten (Frühstück) ist er sehr voll und man muss länger warten (oder die Treppen nehmen). Das Frühstück war ok, Toast, Bagels, Ei und Würstchen sowie Waffeln. Wer es süß mag, ist im Vorteil 😉
Super war, dass man das Gepäck am Abreisetag noch vor Ort lassen konnte.

Also, one of my complaints with the ice machine on our floor didn’t work. I received a text message saying that they would look into it but my whole stay there was no ice on my floor.

"Great location for Times Square and Broadway areas.  Very busy hotel.  Very busy breakfast area.  Elevator situation was the only real downside.

"Great Stay – Safe, Comfortable, and Centrally Located

I had a great experience staying at Home2 Suites by Hilton in New York City. The location is excellent — very central and just a short walk from a train station, making it easy to get around. It’s also close to everything in Times Square, which was perfect for exploring the city.

The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout my stay. I was traveling alone with my two daughters and felt very safe at all times, which was a top priority for me.

Our room was well-equipped and comfortable, featuring a full-size bed and a sofa that converted into a twin bed. It also included a mini kitchenette with a microwave, coffee maker, refrigerator, and basic utensils like plates and cutlery. Additional amenities such as a hair dryer, clothing iron, and in-room safe were also provided, which added to the convenience.

Breakfast was a nice bonus, with a variety of options that helped us start our day off right.

The only downside was the elevator system in the lobby — during peak times, there was a bit of congestion and the wait could be long.

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel, especially for families or solo travelers looking for a safe, comfortable, and well-located place to stay in the heart of New York City. ",8,Odemarys,2025-07-05

"Hotel was clean and staff was friendly. Location is convenient.

The complimentary breakfast area was extremely overcrowded. Few available tables.

There are simply not enough elevators for the number of guests this hotel accommodates. Several times the elevator was full and people still got on which created an overflow and the elevator will not move until someone gets off. Sometimes the elevator arrived already full. 

I would not stay here again.

"Glad we didn’t listen to some the reviews about the problems with the elevator and breakfast areas, and not book this place. We had no such issues. The elevator system was fast and efficient. In our 11 days there, we only waited more than two minutes for it once. We went to breakfast between 7 and 8:30 a.m. every day and never once had a problem finding a table. Loved the breakfast, especially the yogurt bar! Still thinking about that! Front, kitchen, housekeeping and maintenance staff were very friendly. Room was small, but adequate, very quiet, and with a lovely kitchenette. I just wish the bathroom door was a real one that closed and not a sliding door that left gaps and insufficient privacy. Hotel provides luggage storage before and after check-in. Make sure to tip staff for doing so; we saw so many people not doing that. Hotel is a few feet from Times Square, and walkable to so many attractions, subway lines, etc. We loved our 11 days at this hotel, and would definitely stay here again!",8,Ruth,2025-06-30

The hotel was great. There are 2 breakfast areas to eat at. Seating was really busy and hard to find seats but it was a good variety of options. The room was great. Had a small couch to sit on and small kitchen area that had everything needed. It was quiet. The AC is loud when it runs but we like that because we use a sound machine. The ice machine on our floor did not work so I had to go up and down floors to get some but it was only a few stairs. The hotel is located in a great area. Walkable to everything and easy to use transportation. A lot of gift shops and close to Times Square and theaters. There were a lot of complaints about the elevators. I can partially agree with that. The concept is smart and makes sense but if there are a lot of people so sometimes you are waiting 10 minutes to get on one that’s not full. Too many people try to pack into them which can cause an overload and it puts the elevator out of service so that can be an issue but that’s not the hotels fault. That’s humans who have no common sense or decency. Overall I would recommend the hotel and stay again! ,8,Samantha,2025-06-27

"I confess that I almost canceled this reservation days before arriving at the hotel based on the service I received online from the team. Let me explain: we have a 1-year-old baby and it was essential to have a crib in the room. The ad said it was available, but when I sent a message to the hotel, the response was always standard: they have it but don't guarantee it will be available on the day. A perfect response to make a mother worry even more considering that we would be living in chaos for 5 nights. It looked like I was talking to some robot instead of a human being.
Anyway, considering it was a Hilton hotel, I gave it a vote of confidence and kept the reservation. Upon arrival, I was surprised by the staff at the reception who were super nice and put us in a quiet room as requested, and said that the crib would be delivered in a few moments.
The room had a perfect size and also had a microwave, dishwasher, minibar, and a sink. Perfect for taking out food and eating in the room if needed.
The location is amazing: two blocks away from Times Square, with a lot of great options of food, and tourist attractions.
Well, not everything is perfect and I have to be honest:
1. The bed linen smells like wet dog. You know when they wash it and it doesn't dry well? So, imagine sleeping with that smell!
2. The sofa bed in the room also smelled really bad. 
3. The elevator is a mess: if you have an appointment, leave about 15 minutes early. ",6,CATHERINE GONÇALVES DA,2025-06-22

"I understand we were in NYC, but when you stay at home to suites, you expect to feel like your home.  Hotel had no area for doing laundry (we were there for a week), other than the hotel doing it for you. Was told laundry cost was $1.00 a piece of clothing, but was so not the case.  Took laundry down and they want me to pay $14.00 for just 1 pair of pants, the cost of the other items listed on their laundry sheet was just as ridiculous.  Additionally, I tried multiple time to call front desk and house keeping, and no one ever picked up the phone.  Was not impressed with the staff.  Hotel itself was nice but we had a small room that was in between 2 elevators. We only half of room (unlike what a normal hotel size should be) because the elevator literally occupied  the other half of what our room should have been.

"The room are clean and comfortable and the location to everything is excellent. The staff were very nice. Two things to know, there is only an ice machine on the 11th floor, which you can not get to because the elevator only lets you go to your floor and the lobby. You can go to the lobby and get it from an employee there. We put it in the freezer so we wouldn't have to keep going down to get more throughout our stay. The elevators often came full in the mornings as everyone was going to breakfast. We had to carry our luggage down 9 flights of stairs after 7 elevators came full and we needed to leave for the airport. To use the elevator, you press your floor and scan your key. It tells you what elevator to take as there are no buttons in the elevator. It's great for security. Once though, the elevator took a long time to come, was stopping at every floor and flashed OL (overload) a few times. When it go to the lobby, those of us assigned to that elevator got on and the elevator did not stop at our floor or for anyone else that had been assigned. It seemed to be randomly going up and down. When it finally stopped, we got off and walked down the stairs rather than stay on it with no clear direction of what it was doing. Over all though, the location, cleanliness, free breakfast and staff are great. Just know, if you can not walk down stairs and dependent on the elevator, there are issues there.",10,Diane,2025-06-15

I requested two beds when I register and paid for the room but I only got one bed and a pull out sofa.  The room service was not daily - no one dressed the room until we left the 2nd night.  The elevators wait was too long. Not worth the money paid!,6,Paulette,2025-06-13
Great spot. Room great. Pull out bed a little lumpy but for a 18 year old-bot bad. Will be back!,10,Kevin,2025-06-13
Bed was very uncomfortable. Pull out bed even worse. I asked for a different room. Pretty much told us no. Room door outside was unlocked the entire time. I told them. Nothing was done. ,6,elena,2025-06-13
"Pros: breakfast was good, clean room, no cook top stove but had a microwave, dishwasher, sink, plates/bowls utensils for family to use, staff were nice

Cons: housekeeping services was not good, the quickest we received the items we requested took 3 hours. They brought up the items after a 2nd request. Elevators were small and took forever. Sometimes the elevator malfunctioned where it didnt scanned the room you enter and didnt take you to your floor so you would have to get out of the elevator, rescanned your card/entered the floor level, and wait for the next elevator. The hallway of the floor we were on was stuffy, didnt have AC. It was hot waiting for the elevators.",6,Merry E,2025-06-13

"We stayed here for our 20th wedding anniversary. We could not be happier. We requested a lower level, and rarely encountered the elevator woes we had read in other reviews, thankfully. It was not noisy and it was incredibly clean (thanks to the staff and their care of our room every other day). It was my first time in the city and I lived every minute of it. Thank you for a wonderful experience for us. ",10,Daniel,2025-06-12

"-Unser Zimmer lag auf dem 25.Floor noch einmal separat durch eine Zwischentür-daher war die Lage sehr ruhig.

-Die Lage des Hotels in Manhattan war superzentral gelegen (genau zwischen Times Square und Rockefeller)

-Frühstück von Warmen-und Kaltspeisen sowie herzhaft zu süß... mehr als ausreichend

-tolle Rooftop-Bar 

Fazit- wir kommen sehr gerne wieder :-)

"The location of this hotel was good. Other than that would not reccomend. The lifts in the property are an absolute joke- when going anywhere or back to your room allow plenty of time because you will be waiting A WHILE! Also our room key didn’t work when we first arrived- it took 4 trips down to reception to get it sorted. Staff uninterested and not apologetic. Room is fine has everything you need. Breakfast extremely basic and busy but the staff in here are lovely. Downstairs in the breakfast room there is a large area being used for hotel laundry- not exactly appetising when eating breakfast! Hotel is extremely busy. The gym is lacking in equipment. It’s just about okay for a basic cardio workout. 
Overall this hotel is okay but there’s definitely better options in New York City ",2,Sarah Louise,2025-06-07

"Das Hotel hat eine Super Lage, man ist sofort auf dem Time-Square und schnell an den Subway-Stationen. Man kann viele Sehenswürdigkeiten von dort aus zu Fuß erreichen.
Das Hotel selber ist groß, gepflegt und sauber.
Zu Stoßzeiten nervt das Warten auf den Fahrstuhl.
Unser Zimmer war nicht riesig, aber groß genug und super ausgestattet. Ein großer Kühlschrank, Mikrowelle, Geschirr, Spüli und andere Dinge.
Genervt hat nachts ein bißchen das Gebläse des Filters, welche zu Covidzeiten angebracht wurden und nicht anstellbar ist. Man hat uns angeboten, das Zimmer zu wechseln, aber ich hatte schon alles aus dem Koffer ausgeräumt.
Das Frühstück ist sehr einfallslos, es gibt immer Frittata, Bratkartoffeln, dann Rührei und Würstchen und am 3. Tag Cheese-Eggs und Bacon im Wechsel. Die Eier waren nicht lecker. Zudem gab es Bagels, Toast und French Toast, 2 verschiedene Marmeladen, Honig @ Peanutbutter, Saft, Kaffee, Müsli, Joghurt, Obst, Waffeln, Muffins und Pencakes. Hört sich viel an, war aber immer das gleiche und ich persönlich mag kein Süßes zum Frühstück. Die Eier waren, wie gesagt, nicht so gut und es war immer tierisch laut beim Frühstücken, und manchmal auch schwer, einen Platz zu finden.
Das Personal war freundlich. Roomservice kommt jeden zweiten Tag, reicht aber.
Das Badezimmer ist modern, die Pflegeprodukte super. 
Ich würde das Hotel auf jeden Fall empfehlen für einen NY-Aufenthalt, allein schon wegen der Lage.",8,Daniela Anneliese,2025-06-07

"I do understand that NYC is quite an expensive city, but for this money I would expect better servise. Noise that was every night out of filter in the room was terrible. Breakfast was probably the worst I ever had. We had broken door to the bathroom and had to wait two days for someone to come over to clean the mess after being fixed. And waiting for elevator over then 15 min after 10am.. was terrible and then stopped at every second floor crowded with people..

The rest was probably fine but to be honest. I will not recommend your hotel in future to my friend.",6,Barbora,2025-06-06

Lovely clean bathroom/shower with toiletries. 
Handy small kitchenette supplied with cleaning supplies and everything you might need. Note; no hob or kettle. 
Good soundpfoofing. I heard no sounds from corridors or other rooms.
I had no issues with lifts. They were fast and clean.
Aircon is very noisy. I had to turn mine off at night though another air system runs constantly too.
I couldn't get connected to internet through hotel wifi at all, but this wasn't an issue as I had plenty data.
Good selection of channels on tv.
Small shop in foyer. Shop & pizza place across from the hotel. Steps from Broadway/Times Sq, its a safe area.

"Overall our stay was okay. The rooms are of decent size as compared to other in NYC. The location is prime and so close to the timesquare.  The street is lively and close to everything touristy. 

However, here are the cons: the Elevators, they are horrible to stay the least. You need atleast 30-45 minutes in the Morning to go down. The place is packed due to breakfast available and this hotel is combination of two home2suites and hampton by hilton. 
Sometimes elevator doesn’t stop at your floor.
Secondly if traveling with Child, don’t ask for a crib, they give you travel Crib which is super to build or broken.

Lastly they clean it every other day or once your stay. So keeping the room clean with a kid and suitcases is really really hard.

Stay here if you are just a couple and want to be near times square. Totally avoid if traveling with a kid.",6,Ripudaman,2025-06-03

Noi abbiamo avuto problemi anche con lo scarico del water che si intasava. Nelle ore di punta è un’impresa prendere l’ascensore, cosa necessaria trattandosi di un edificio di 38 piani.

One of the elevators consistently took clients to the wrong floors, but the rest seemed ok.
Some staff was nice, some were not at all friendly.
I believe the cleaning staff accidentally took my ball cap, when gathering towels, and the front desk staff was unable to help inquire about it. Supposedly they'll call me if they find it, but considering he didn't ask my phone #, and scribbled a note about the hat on scrap paper, I'm not holding my breath.
The room was clean and a decent size for NYC.",6,Verified traveler,2025-05-26
This hotel has a great location. The room was small but clean and had a great view. Why I will never stay here again is because of the fact that getting up or down in the elevators was a nightmare. You wait for five minutes and the elevator shows up stuffed with people. Wait another five minutes and the same thing. From 23 floors up stairs are not an option. The breakfast area had 200 people and tables for 40! Massive crowds in the lobby at check in time. Way overcrowded and not user friendly if you forget something in the room there is no way to go back up to get it in less than an hour. 360 dollars a night felt like we should have gotten much better.,6,Nathaniel,2025-05-26

"Me and my best friend stayed for 6 nights, we only managed to have breakfast once, as it was absolute chaos and the lift situation in the morning before 10am is a nightmare! The air conditioning in the room was super noisy, the shower leaked and there were flys coming out of a hole in the wall. The floor in the room wasn’t cleaned the whole time, as our feet would be black from the dirt\dust. The hotel is in a good location, however it was noisy being near to Times Square and cars honking continuously and loud music being played from the cannabis corner shop. Staff were friendly though, it’s just a shame with the amount of guests this hotel had its not more equipped with more lifts and a better breakfast set up. Overall it wasn’t a bad or good experience, it was average.",6,Nicola Deborah,2025-05-17

"Overall a nice place right next to Times Square.   Negative was the elevators.   When you need an elevator it is assigned when you press the button.  Problem is no ine knows how many are in your party and rhe elevators get overfilled and stop working yet still stop at the assigned floor, sometimes every floor with no more room on the elevator.   People were getting upset with this and would jump out to take the stairs even from the 25th floor.  Other than waiting for 10 minutes for an elevator with another 5 plus minutes on the elevator the hotel was nice.",6,Kathy E,2025-05-16

"Das Hotel liegt direkt am Times Square, dementsprechend war natürlich „direkt vor der Haustür“ viel los und der Geräuschpegel war auch hoch. Uns hat das nicht gestört. Es gab einige U-Bahn-Stationen direkt um die Ecke, was echt klasse war. Man konnte aber auch einiges fussläufig erreichen. Die Fahrstuhl-Situation im Hotel haben wir nicht als problematisch angesehen. Wir mussten einmal 10 Minuten warten, sonst war immer ein Fahrstuhl sofort parat. 
Man sollte beachten, dass die Amerikaner andere „Bettwäsche“ haben als u.a. die Deutschen. Housekeeping hat es nicht immer verstanden, dass wir zwei Decken benötigen. Aber die Mitarbeitenden an der Rezeption haben uns dann immer sofort weitergeholfen. 
Kann das Hotel wärmstens weiterempfehlen! ",8,Lisa Jasmin,2025-05-13

Elevator control was a bit inconvenient mainly during breakfast hours, so plan accordingly to go down during that time.

"Arrived from Australia after a 24 hour trip and discovered they had ‘oversold” rooms and did not have a room for us, even though we booked and paid over 6 months in advance. After a long wait they found us a room at a partner hotel, with no transport we had to walk ourselves with our luggage in the middle of the night, we then had to check out the next day, walk back to this hotel to be checked in for the rest of our stay, once again walking with all our luggage back again. Then we got the smallest hotel room with uncomfortable beds, no housekeeping and the elevators are the worst thing on the face of the planet. A weird way to select your floor, all were full and impossible to get, on check out day, it took us just under 45 mins to get to the lobby after waiting for numerous full elevators to open and unable to get on. Way too many guests for the size of the dining room, long waits then for breakfast that was cold by the time you actually got something then sat down. In short, DO NOT BOOK TO STAY HERE. Worst experience ever… it is your money and experience, so do what you want if it is in your price point, but be warned, it will be a terrible terrible experience that will reflect badly on any memories you have of NY. Staff on the front desk were polite and clearly overworked and understaffed - they were trying to helpful. We won’t be ever going back to NY based on this hotel experience alone! Just don’t book here! ",4,Daniel,2025-05-11

"The front desk staff was rude, and it took a long argument to get the room we had booked. The rest of the hotel staff was kind and helpful. The hotel was overcrowded, making the lobby unpleasant during the day. Breakfast is complimentary from 7–10 a.m., but the dining area is packed, and elevator wait times are unreasonably long — on checkout day I waited 30 minutes with my luggage. The location is excellent, right in Times Square, near theaters, public transportation, and attractions like Rockefeller Center. However, it's extremely noisy, crowded, and the streets are packed. The room size was reasonable for central New York. We booked a room with a kitchenette, which included utensils, a microwave, a fridge, and a coffee machine.",2,Naphtali,2025-05-11

"Best part of this hotel is probably the location. Very easy to get on and off subway. Room was clean and seemed quiet considering the location. Very busy nearby but if that’s the what you’re here for, then this is the place. They have a rooftop bar, however didn’t have time to check it out. They open very late in the afternoon. Only issue I had was trying to reach the front desk between 10-11am. Phone rang for a minimum of 5 minutes. No one ever answered. Other than that the stay was good. ",8,Ryan,2025-05-10

Otherwise the property is great. (All this happened after I called and confirmed the room the previous day of my check in for a room with queen and sofa bed and kitchenette.)",6,Athif,2025-05-10
"Das Hotel war sehr sauber und bei perfekter Lage zu vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten  einfach spitze! Die Zimmer waren klein, sehr sauber und mit einer Küchenzeile ausgestattet. Die Klimaanlage war sehr laut und dies war nicht zu ändern . Das Hotel hat aber ein Problem mit den Aufzügen. Obwohl einige vorhanden sind wartet man zu bestimmten Zeiten ewig ( bis zu 20 Min ) . Und wenn man dann drin ist , hält er in jedem Stock an. Das verzögert leider alles sehr . Beim rauf fahren ist es besser geregelt. Am besten geht man zwischen 7-8 Uhr frühstücken und verlässt vor dem check out um 10 Uhr das Hotel und stürzt sich ins Getümmel. Frühstück ist ausreichend aber hektisch . Keine Wurst , kein Käse . Dafür tgl Obst und frische Waffeln und Bagels . ",10,Kathrin,2025-05-10

"Excelente hotel, ótima localização, dentro da Times Square, sendo possível fazer praticamente tudo a pé, além de muitas estações de metrô ao redor.
Viajamos com um bebê de 1 ano e assim que chegamos pedimos o bercinho ""pack n play"" e em poucos minutos um funcionário chegou ao quarto para montagem.
O tamanho do quarto é muito bom, o microondas, pia e a geladeira ajudaram muito na logística com um bebê. Não tem fogão.
Café da manhã simples e com pouca variedade. Não possuem cadeirão para bebes, o que achei um ponto negativo. Além disso, de opções de comidas naturais, só tinham bananas e ovos, sendo que alguns dias, em vez de ovos eram omeletes já recheados com queijo.
O quarto é arrumado dia sim, outro não e portanto as toalhas não são trocadas todos os dias, mas pode-se solicitar qualquer coisa se for necessário.
O ar condicionado funcionou bem e o Wi-Fi, após um breve cadastro, também funcionou bem. O elevador de fato é o ponto negativo do hotel. Adotaram um sistema ""inteligente"" mas que não funciona. 
Perde-se muito tempo esperando e as vezes chega cheio!
O sistema calcula a quantidade de pessoas por andar que chamam o elevador, mas acontece que muitas vezes, uma pessoa chama o elevador para um grupo grande, de 4 ou 5 pessoas, o que faz com que o cálculo feito pelo sistema nunca dê certo! Seria interessante programar uma média de pessoas em cada grupo para que dê certo.
O atendimento dos funcionários foi muito solícito, diferente do atendimento do mesmo hotel em Orlando.",10,Taimara,2025-05-09

"So much to love about this property. We were sucked in an interior room off the mail hallway on the 34th floor. Hard Rock Hotel was across the street - along with great pizza by the slice and close to Times Square without being in the middle of that craziness. Room was well laid out with a roll away table, plenty of counter space and loved having the sink, small fridge and plates and such. For me the bed could have been more comfortable- main bed felt more like a pull out thin mattress. Was fine overall. The main concern was the room thermostat couldn't be programmed below 68 F- but our room never went below 70. I really prefer a cold room to sleep and it was just hard to get a good nights rest for me because of it. 

Complimentary breakfast was great! Definitely packed but nice to fuel up for the day. I'd stay again.",8,Amber,2025-05-07

"Last week we stayed at the home 2 suites by Hilton Times Square hotel for a week.The hotel was clean, looked well taken care of. Although it’s been rated as 3 stars I did not feel it was only 3 stars, more like 4 stars. 
The breakfast that is included offers a lot of options however it’s is really really crowded. We only had breakfast once at 6 am and were the first, we saw quickly how busy it got and decided we would have breakfast at our convenient time somewhere else. The elevators are also very busy, so we read some reviews beforehand and asked for a lower floor so we could use the stairs if needed. 
Although the room is small (but normal in New York) it offers everything you need, small kitchen including full-size fridge, microwave and dishwasher. The airconditioning works well, but is quite noisy like you are in a plane :) but we got used to it and didn’t really mind as it was cooling the room properly. We choose this hotel due to its location, just walking out of the street brings you to Times Square! Across the hotel there is a food court easy to get your water bottles and some snacks. Also a good pizza place little Italy is across the hotel, definitely worth to try it :) if location and convenience is what you are looking for? Then I would definitely recommend this hotel!

The security inside hotel was top notch. We felt safe and secure overnight while sleeping. The staff was wonderful. The room was clean and quiet. The surrounding buildings in the area outside are just off Times Square in NYC so they had the dirty feel and look with lots of scaffolding and construction.

"Hotelli oli hyvässä kunnossa ja henkilökunta ystävällistä. Sijainti hyvin keskeinen, eli kadulta tuleviin ääniin kannattaa varautua. Hissijärjestelyt erittäin huonot ja odottelimme välillä hissiä 10-15 minuuttia. Huonettamme ei käyty siivoamassa kertaakaan ja jouduimme soittaa erikseen respaan, että saimme uudet pyyhkeet ja roskakorit tyhjennettyä (tämä tapahtui lauantaina, kun huoneen saimme keskiviikkona - olimme päivät ulkona, joten emme ole olleet siivoamisen esteenäkään). Aamupala ihan ok, joskin hyvin ruuhkainen. Lyhyt kävelymatka monelle eri juna-asemalle, mikä teki sijainnista kätevän. ",6,Verified traveler,2025-04-23

"The convenience of the hotel's location is fantastic.  A few blocks from the major Broadway theatres, literally steps away from the end of Times Square, and easy walking distance to the South end of Central Park, Radio City Music Hall, Carnegie Hall, MoMA, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Rockefeller Center, and more.  Rockefeller center subway station is a block away, and another station a few blocks away if you need to catch a different train.  Quality of breakfast food was mediocre, as expected at a complimentary hotel buffet, but was kept stocked and the tables cleared.  My only real complaint about the hotel is the elevator system. . .you select the floor you want, scan your room key, and it tells you which elevator to take.  In theory, it sounds great, but since the system clearly doesn't measure load capacity, the result is a mess!  You stand waiting for an elevator, just to find that when it finally arrives, it's full, and you have to start the process again, then when you finally get on the elevator, you can plan on stopping multiple times on the way to the lobby.  We stayed on the 24th floor, and I would say on average, we stopped at least 5 times on each trip down.  Only other critique is there was more space than necessary dedicated to the kitchenette and almost no storage for clothing for those of us who prefer to unpack rather than living out of a suitcase during our stay.",8,Joni,2025-04-18

Would have been much higher if not for lift situation. Absolute chaos in morning and evening. We were on 13th floor and on at least 3 occasions had to wait over 20 mins for lift. On 2 occasions gave up and walked down. Digital system for lifts is poor and causes a lot of animosity with guests pushing and shoving to get in and out. Location of property excellent and also room was really good. What let’s this hotel down is lifts and chaos at breakfast with a free for all and no seating for number of guests in hotel. ,8,Steven,2025-04-17

"De ligging is perfect aan 48th street W, om de hoek bij Times Square en diverse Metrostations. Het hotel is zeer druk, zelfs met 5 liften, moest je soms heel lang wachten. Ook het systeem waar je de liften mee bedient is niet heel handig. In de lobby hangt een display, waarop je je etage moet selecteren, met je sleutelkaart van je kamer krijg je dan een lift toegewezen. Als er heel veel mensen dezelfde lift toegewezen krijgen, maar die passen niet allemaal in de lift, dan gaat die onnodig langs al die etages. Het ontbijt was zeer slecht en vreselijk druk. Je moest vechten voor een plekje. We hebben daarom elke ochtend buiten de deur ontbeten. Het hotel en de kamers waren heel schoon en het personeel vriendelijk en behulpzaam. We kregen een upgrade bij aankomst (invalide kamer??, 37e verdieping op de hoek). Super uitzicht alleen doordat het een invalide douche had, werd de badkamer door het douchen zeiknat en liep het water ook de kamer in. Waarom een invalidekamer een upgrade was begrepen wij niet en nadat alles kletsnat was door het douchen, hadden we nog gevraagd of we alsnog onze gereserveerde kamer konden krijgen, maar dat kon niet meer. We moesten de volgende dag maar terugkomen. Dat hebben we uiteindelijk niet gedaan omdat we net alles hadden uitgepakt. Elke dag extra handdoeken gevraagd om de boel droog te maken.",6,Dennis,2025-04-17

Das Frühstück ist einfach, aber ausreichend , manchmal ziemlich voll, so dass man kurz auf einen freien Tisch warten muss.  Wir haben aber nie länger als 5 Minuten gewartet. 
Viele schimpfen über die Aufzüge, aber auch hier mussten wir nur einmal etwas länger warten, weil eine sehr große Gruppe angereist ist und dann natürlich  bei nur 5 Aufzügen Wartezeiten nötig sind.

"Can't really get any much better location in Manhattan for connections. All amenities in place, clean room, kind and helpful staff, endless choices for food and leisure within walking distance. Only lifts can have quite a waiting time during busy morning hours.

"The level of customer service that I experience with Makalya should be studied. She helped me navigate and got a refund and helped untangle several bookings. With was very helpful, kind and proactive. I would stay there at the hotel again just because of her. Also there were a ton of people there and she still took care of me. The staff overall was amazing. Makalya stood out because I was in high stress and help resolve my issue with Expedia. Very grateful to know people like her exists.",10,Donna,2025-03-31

The air conditioned noise is continuous and very annoying.The lifts service is horrible, the waiting time is always too long. The breakfast is of very low quality and badly organised. If you want a coffee you have to go across the lobby where groups are checking out, if you want a yogurt or a muffin you must descent one floor, if you want eggs, you need to go upstairs again… I’ll never come back to this horrible hotel.",2,JAIME,2025-03-28

Only a few nitpicky things: This is the only time when I needed a laundry facility and found out they didn't have one. There's also not much of a lobby area for sitting and waiting when they have two hotels conjoined together. The dining area doubles as a luggage storage area - which is nice, but I wish there was additional space for lounging outside of the room. ",10,Marcus,2025-03-26

Enige echte minpunt zijn de liften. Tijdens de ochtendspits moet je soms wel 20 minuten wachten, ze staan echt heel erg slecht afgestemd. Als je niet te hoog zit kun je de trap nemen, maar niet altijd mogelijk. ",8,Tosca,2025-03-02

Breakfast was crowded but the use of downstairs helped. Staff was super friendly.  ,10,Rodney,2025-03-01
"Abbiamo prenotato 8 giorni per 2 qui nell’ Home2 Suite.
Struttura nel bel mezzo di Manhattan, praticamente quasi dentro Times Square, offre servizi come la colazione inclusa, che per chi preferisce il dolce non è proprio al top ma comunque c’è della scelta, molta scelta invece per il salato. Le camere vengono pulite a giorni alterni, gli ascensori quasi sempre veloci e disponibili ma negli orari di punta si deve aspettare un po’ di più. La posizione è ottima, davvero, appena usciti dall’hotel si è ad un passo da times square, pochi passi dalla metro e pochi passi da Rockefeller Center. Molto comodo poi anche la possibilità di lasciare le valigie in hotel dopo il check out. La camera aveva servizi come frigorifero, microonde, lavastoviglie, posate ecc.. che si sono rivelate molto utili, in generale comunque è accogliente; unica pecca la ventola che è sempre accesa, non si spegne mai, fa un po’ di rumore ma poi ti ci abitui. In conclusione ci siamo trovati molto bene, consiglio vivamente questo hotel per la posizione e per i servizi, nonostante qualche piccolo difetto.",8,Jonathan,2025-03-01
"This hotel was wonderful! Checking in and out was a breeze, and the staff was incredibly kind. The room was also spotless which was great. My boyfriend and I stayed on the 23rd floor and it was very quiet, which wasn't something I expected staying in a very populated area. As a bonus anything you could possibly want or need was in walking distance. The only downside is that the free breakfast is extremely crowded. From 9 to 10 it takes an insane amount of time to get an elevator, and then when you finally do, all the tables downstairs are taken. However that's not the hotels fault, so I still highly recommend it!",10,Laura,2025-03-01

- Noisy air circulating fan was running constantly. Couldn’t sleep the first two nights.

- Elevators were always busy, had to wait 20 minutes to go down.
- Restutant was full for morning breakfast.

Pros:
- Great location.
- Clean room (but unfortunately noisy fan).

So we call the hotel and they assured us that we have till 3am before the reservation slot would be canceled. It was our first time in NYC and being that close to time square made navigation easier. If he had no idea where we were, we just asked “how do we get to time square” and that was that. We got to see Law and Order production outside of the Fox News station on our walk.

"It's a clean convenient motel.  The elevator system is convoluted, atrocious, and frustrating. It took us over 15 minutes to get from the 20th floor to the lobby at 8 am in the morning.  I will never stay here again. If you choose to stay here make sure you select a lower floor so that you can have the option of walking down when it gets busy. ",6,Major,2025-02-28
"Fantastic location. Very clean. The room is small but the key is to not live out of your suitcase, use the dresser and armoire. Parking is valet and runs around $100 per 24 hours and it can take up to an hour for them to grab your car. There is no convenient parking that is much cheaper. Also pay attention to how the elevators work and make sure you get on the one that it tells you to go on. During breakfast hours the elevators take a long time so ask for a room on a lower floor.

The area outside is equally chaotic with no waiting space for taxis so you're having to dodge a lot.

"The hotel is in a great spot for anyone wanting to visit Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Broadway, Hells Kitchen etc.  Even Central Park is just about a 20 minute walk, so the location is wonderful.  The area outside is a bit much with the people trying to sell tours etc, but once you get through them it's fine.  There's just a LOT going on, so if you're looking for a quiet spot, this might not be right for you, but if you don't mind some chaos, you can't ask for a better location.  All of the staff we encountered were wonderful & very helpful.  Even parking was a breeze leaving your keys with the front desk and they took it away and brought it back when we were done (just remember to call them as you are packing to leave to give them time to get your car!  It takes a little bit of time to retrieve it from the garage!)  Breakfast time is a bit hectic in the lobby especially on weekends, so go early! ",8,Stacey,2025-02-24

"The location of the homes 2 suites was great. Not far at all from Times Square and easy to get to all the well known landmarks. The room wasn’t huge but had everything we needed and was clean and modern. Our cleaner was great and went the extra mile. 
Breakfast, however was absolute chaos! It was a complete free for all. There was not enough tables and some people were having to stand up and eat their breakfast while others just circled the room until a table became available. There were no staff on hand to guide people and even though we went at the advised ‘quiet’ time it was still impossible to get a table. One of our party even sustained a burn from people pushing in the coffee queue.  
The elevators were also problematic. It was a key card system where you were told which elevator to wait for. When that elevator arrived it was often already full of people. There were 5 elevators but despite this we were kept waiting on our floor for 10/15 minutes  Luckily we were only on the 10th floor and could use the stairs. 
Despite this we had a great time in NYC and the hotel had a really nice roof top bar with lovely staff. All the staff we spoke to really tried to be helpful. 
If we come back to New York I don’t think we would stay there again, which is a shame as it’s a great location and the rooms are very well appointed.

"The hotel facilities were fine but the elevators were a gong show. We stayed on the 28th floor and had to take the stairs one day. Elevators were spotty in ever coming. Lobby going up was chaotic but staff helped out. Once you are on your floor you are on your own yo try to get an elevator down. Woman on my floor brought a book and read for 20 mins waiting for an elevator with room to come by. We walked down. My friends on the 33 floor had to walk down with their luggage in order to check out. Total gong show. 

I like breakfast included and am easy to please but the eggs were not eggs, the yogurt was some sort of processed product out of a machine and the tables were totally inadequate for the 600+ rooms using the facilities. 

Location of the hotel is excellent and staff are lovely but the elevators make it tough to stay here. ",6,Colleen,2025-02-21

We asked for extra blankets and got them promptly. I will definitely consider this hotel for future stays.",10,Nina,2025-02-20
"Normally it is hard to give ANYONE all fives. However, this one hit a homer run. Going to take it from first arrival to departure (3 day stay). It was really nice to have more than one door entering and exiting. Waiting our turn was a really short wait vs other hotel/motels I've been to. 
The hospitality specialist at the front desk was easy to work with. We had our key, how the elevator works, breakfast and the best way to get around within 5-7 mins. 

How many people go to their room and it's cold.... NOT HERE! The temperature was set nicely, of course we adjusted it, but we didn't wait for hours for it to warm up.  

Suite was as advertised on site and pictures. Just remember if you need a heading element, it's down stairs just ask for it. 

Ordered a delivery that evening, the gentleman in the lobby assisted bc my hands were full. It was a very kind gesture. Helped me with the elevator to make sure my food wasn't going to drop. 

Next morning, I was very surprised by the breakfast. It was a hot breakfast but loved the variety of choices, so did my kid. Everything was hot fresh and flavorful.

Hospitality was amazing, location was great, value, food... It would be a place I could see bringing the whole family to experience. Thank you ",10,Donald,2025-02-20

"This hotel is located within minutes of Times Square and the Theatre District so everything is walkable.  About 5 minutes by Lyft from Penn Station, 12 minutes to Central Park and Museum of Natural History. The tour busses are on the corner. The subway to Battery Park is just around the corner so getting to the Staten Island or Liberty Island Ferry is easy and convenient as well as transfers to other POI. The rooms have a queen bed and a Twin pull out couch - they only allow 3 people per room so that's a drawback.  We got ""connecting"" rooms which means they were across a private hall from each other, but each were actually separate - throw the dead bolt to prop open so kids can go back and forth. Each has a kitchenette feature which is helpful as NYC portions in restaurants are large and expensive but keeping and heating leftovers easy.  They warn you of the crowded times for the hotel breakfast and they are not kidding - getting up and down in elevators between 930 am and 1045 am almost impossible - we were on 15th floor and ended up walking down twice. Too crowded to use breakfast option. There is a small convenience market across the street with hot and cold items that are very good as well as a pizza shop that is EXCELLENT! ",8,TAMARA,2025-02-13

"Almost everything was very good. The staff were helpful and friendly, The rooms were very clean and a comfortable size. The buffet breakfast had plenty of options and was good (as buffets go). And reasonably priced for the location. 

I would easily give this place 5 stars, if not for the unacceptable elevator system. Waits to get down to the lobby during moderately busy times were typically 10 minutes. They were worse around checkout times and dinner. We were on an upper floor, so stairs were not an option. 

Seems like it's supposed to be a ""smart"" system that tells guests which elevator to take. Once you swipe your key, a screen indicates which elevator you need to take. There are no floor indicators, as to where the elevator is at while you are waiting. Additionally, when we finally caught an elevator with enough space for us, it often stopped on many floors (another 5 minutes) only to see very frustrated and angry guests not being able to fit. Sorry to say, but it was very frustrating and stressful and it's very unlikely that we will return unless they revamp the system.  ",6,JOSEPH,2025-02-12

Como ela é magrinha, ficou razoável, mas um adulto não fica bem ali. Deveriam rever aquele sofá urgentemente. Café da manhã é bom, mas estilo americano, que não nos agrada muito, mas também estava ok. Muito trânsito nos elevadores no horário de pico do café da manhã.

"Great room. Comfortable and quiet. The elevators are not adequate to handle busy times of day when the hotel is full. I waited for over 30 minutes to get to my room on more than one occasion. The software used to assign an elevator to you often got confused. Once, after waiting for 10 minutes for an elevator, I began ascending and the system removed my floor from the cue and I was effectively stranded on another floor. I had to walk back down the escape stairs. Luckily, I was only 4 floors up. However, had I been closer to my 27th floor the walk would not have been very enjoyable.",6,Jeffrey,2025-02-09

Beds were comfortable and rooms were decently sized for a hotel in Times Square. Loved the fact that we had a fridge and small kitchen sink as well.

"Long line to check in with one person behind the desk at check in time. Another person eventually came out and when it was my turn they couldn't find my reservation. He had to go back of house to do some checks before I was given my room key. The room itself was very small but perfectly formed. It had an extra pull out sofa bed but I wouldn't recommend more than 2 people in this room as it would be an awful squeeze with luggage too. 
Kitchen equipment was all there with microwave and fridge and coffee machine. 
Bed was comfy but never known there to be security tags on pillows before! Like the hard magnetic ones on clothes. I had to switch off the heating as it was so noisy but that still left an extractor fan noise that was constantly running, a bit like white noise. I zoned it out but if you're a light sleeper you may need ear plugs.
Issue with elevator on last day where it took 20 mins to get on one to the lobby, 3 arrived from higher floors and were completely full. I had to call reception to get help as I had my heavy case and needed to get down. 
Free bag hold and coffee in the lobby was nice and breakfast was pretty decent compared to my last visit in another hotel that included breakfast. Plenty of seating and a good choice of food to keep you going for the day. I'd stay again as it was pretty central and had great room facilities.",8,Paula,2025-01-27

Staff were excellent and very attentive. Hotel room was spacious with a kitchen (sink, fridge/freezer and microwave) was also very clean and bed was very comfortable. 
Cons:
- AC: the air con would never turn off even though ant the controls it was off and it would take ages to heat up. 
- Lift: even though there was 5 lifts it was take some time for the lift to come up/down 
- Lobby: due to the placement of reception, the lobby would become very busy and therefore you’d have to walk around and navigate through a load of people to get to the lift. 

Overall I’d recommend this hotel especially for the price to location performance. ",8,Anas,2025-01-24

They will charge you $150 for early check in even though there’s already room available. The elevator system sucks! Waiting time to get to the lobby are worst! Either the elevator is full of there is no available on your floor. It’s the same thing going up to your floor. We waited 15 mins. Just to down to the lobby. The housekeeper did not replenish toilet needs. They only cleaned the rooms in 4 days that we stayed.,6,Leslie Camille,2025-01-19

The Times Square location was perfect for theatre, walking and exploring the city. They offer breakfast that is ok but go early as it gets crowded. Also we were on second floor across from Hard Rock hotel. Although there was a blackout blind the blinking lights can disturb sleeping.

Our shower was never hot and I realized to late into my firat shower that the shampoo, conditioner and body wash were empty. It only took about five minutes to have that delivered to our room. Another downside is the lack of ability to control your room temperature. Not everyone likes a 70° room to sleep in. Cracking the window doesn't help when it only opens less than a finger width. Despite making sure my honors number was on the reservation we never had the ""perks"" that come with that. ",6,Mari,2025-01-12

Noi avevamo una tripla: il letto matrimoniale era comodo mentre il divano letto per nulla ( ho dormito io lì per evitare che mia figlia si alzasse piena di dolori). Colazione buona, scelta più ampia per il salato invece che dolce. Essendo stati a Natale abbiamo trovato tutto full e ogni giorno dovevamo attendere per molti minuti gli ascensori e talvolta anche il tavolo per la colazione.

"When we arrive there, we’re not enough blankets to accommodate the third person. The room was not clean although we were allowed to go to the room. Staff members kept entering the room while we were in the room without knocking to continue to prepare the room. Limited areas to sit in the dining area. The worst part was the hotel elevators. Complicated system designed for safety, but very confusing as when selecting the elevator, it does not ask for a number of passengers so you have to repeatedly wait for long lines as there’s no buttons inside the elevator to select a floor so you may have to wait 2 to 4 cycles before actually being able to get on an elevator
The hotel was convenient close to a lot of nearby. Events staff was friendly. They had areas to have luggage stored to accommodate early arrivals late departures.",4,Geri,2025-01-09

"The hotel has a very odd elevator system. I observed several guests who just checked in and could not figure out how to use the elevators. The lobby environment is quite chaotic most of the time. There are not a lot of places people can sit down in the lobby area. The guest room is decently appointed and clean. I was there during a very cold part of the year and the room never really got warm. The highest the temperature ever reached was 69, even if I set the thermastat higher. That's a problem. The TV system is good, many channels and streamers. Bathroom is small, but nice. Water pressure not good, but that's NYC typically. I like the proximity to the theatres, Sardi's, etc. I might consider it again in the future.",8,Paul,2025-01-07

"This hotel really is in Times Square. It is in close walking distance to the subway. However, the area around the hotel is constantly busy, dirty, and smelly. The lobby was almost always packed and wait times for the elevator were too long. This forces guests to use the staff stairwell. The free breakfast is convenient and decent but, again, it was too crowded and the hotel has been forced to add seating and even food options downstairs among the laundry carts. This was truly shocking! All in all the hotel is decent. ",6,Kaitlyn,2025-01-06

"My family came to NYC on New Year's Day for one night.  This hotel was booked because of its convenient location, price and amenities (sofa bed and breakfast included).  I do not often write reviews unless a stay is extremely good or bad.  After booking, I read over some reviews and was slightly concerned about the elevator and breakfast experience we were going to have.  Once arriving and checking in I was happy that we were able to store our bags without a fee.  So many hotels charge people which I find ridiculous.  The elevator system was very easy to follow.  Click on your floor and scan your hotel key card.  It assigns you an elevator number.  Easy peasy.  We never waited more than 30 seconds for an elevator at any time of day.  I do not understand why so many people had problems with it but was very happy that everything went smoothly for us.  Breakfast was another area I was concerned about, however when I went down at 7:30am was very happy that this too was a very pleasant experience. There was plenty of seating, both at the main level and downstairs.  There was plenty of options and two sides for people to get their breakfast at so there was never a long line.  Our room was definitely not the smallest I have ever stayed in.  It was an average room. Ours came with a kitchen that was lined up against the same wall as our tv but it was FULLY stocked.Microwave, sink, dishwasher, plates, cutlery, soap etc.  We didn't use much of it but how convenient!Will stay here again!",10,Emily,2025-01-03

Hotel tinha café da manhã que era bem concorrido mas os funcionários agilizavam repondo as comidas e limpando as mesas para. Café tipo americano . Algumas frutas . Máquinas para fazer waffles, cupcakes, achei bem variado, não posso reclamar. A localização do hotel excelente, a uma quadra da Times Square. Metros e restaurantes em volta.

The automatic elevator system has kinks in the system that slow it down significantly during high traffic times.

Advertised a serviced studio but no basics such as kettle and wine glasses.  Quality of breakfast poor and did not use after first day.   Property advertised with washing machine, there is not one, only costly laundry service.  DO  NOT STAY HERE!",2,Jacqueline,2024-12-30
Great location but that’s about it. Room wasn’t ready until closer to 7. Thermostat was not working so it was very hot and could not do anything about it. Called maintenance who showed up once and said he would be back to fix it but that didn’t happen. The pullout was horrible. Didn’t try the breakfast as we heard people waited in a line for a hour. ,6,Alpa,2024-12-29

"If there were an award for the absolute worst hotel experience, Home2 Suites by Hilton Times Square would take the trophy without a doubt. This place is nothing short of a disaster. The check-in area feels like a fish market, and the chaos doesn’t stop there. The area outside the elevators is a madhouse, the breakfast area reeks of disorder, and the baggage area is a complete joke. Despite requesting a clean-up multiple times over four days, the room was never touched by housekeeping.

The elevators are slow to the point of being comically inefficient, making you wait forever just to go up or down. Service? What service? It’s like they don’t even know the meaning of the word. To top it off, we were woken up multiple times in the middle of the night by false fire alarms. Not once, but three times!

As for the room itself, it’s as uncomfortable as it gets—definitely not worth the outrageous $400 a night. Honestly, the staff and management should be ashamed of themselves for allowing such a disgrace of a hotel to operate. It’s beyond a joke—this place is a disgrace.",2,Ashok,2024-12-27

"The lift system is a good system except during 7am-9.30am the busier of the breakfast period which is 6am10am, and also 3pm-6pm when check in is at its busiest and people coming back from days out, these periods are chaos. 
The complimentary breakfast is not the best but good variety of choice, found hot food to be warm at best.
Staff at check in not very informative, no explanation about how lifts work, ice bucket locations, small but important detail.
The rooms are very good with plenty of facilities in them. Ice bucket are in corridors.
House keeping do like to let the doors bang so if you are having a lay in from a late night he aware, and put do not disturb labels on your door.
Overall very pleased after all you get what you pay for, and in New York you only really need a comfortable room for the night and when you work out the lift system and best timings in can work well.",6,Peter,2024-12-21

"I really enjoyed my stay and being close to everything. The price was affordable despite it being near Christmas time. My only disappointment was the breakfast buffet. There was very limited seating in the breakfast area (big crowd), the bagels were still frozen and the lack of plastic wear made it difficult to take breakfast upstairs in comfort away from the crowd. The elevators can take a long time especially during check in and check out hours so if you’re not afraid to get your steps, use the steps. ",8,Tierra,2024-12-21

Nobody told us there was a rooftop bar, no information whatsoever about our stay. When we did discover the rooftop bar, we decided to give it a try. The man operating the elevator doors to get to the rooftop bar look like he was having the worst time of his life…when we asked if we could go up to get a drink he rolled his eyes And reluctantly let us onto the elevator. While we were waiting on the elevator, there were others that wanted to go to the rooftop and he was absolutely annoyed that he had to take us up to the top. Then when we checked out, I had to wait nine minutes ( yep, I timed it)  Until the bellhop guy finished his personal phone conversation about what his friend was gonna wear that evening before I could check our luggage so we could walk around New York without carrying it.

Be prepared to pay a fee of $100 per day per night of security deposit stay. They receive you and store your bags on the ground floor with  kindness and organization if you arrive before check-in time. Very convenient!.

Very small room well equipped , it has a mini refrigerator, microwave and utensils. But the room is extremely hot, you can't regulate the temperature on the thermostat, and the air conditioning is extremely noisy. Comfortable pillows but super uncomfortable mattress sunk in the middle, ended up with back pain.

1. The HVAC system in my room would turn on and off constantly throughout the night and every time it turned on there was a very loud noise that woke me up. I probably woke up 6 or 7 times throughout the night from this.

2. There are not enough elevators to accommodate all of the people in the hotel. I chose to walk up 22 flights of stairs to my room at one point because of the line for the elevators.

"The property is well located, it is clean, there was enough seating for breakfast, and the rooftop bar was fantastic!

I absolutely loathed the elevators. Every time that we called for one, whether we were on our floor or in the lobby, we couldn’t find one that would accommodate us all at one time. Getting from our floor to the lobby was a constant challenge. I actually begged a group on an elevator to please allow my father to ride down with them. He had just had his knee replaced and simply couldn’t do the steps. They begrudgingly agreed.
Short of adding more elevators, I am not sure what a viable solution is but the situation is definitely a turn off",8,Elaine,2024-12-07
I have stayed at thsi hotel before and this time i was very disappointed that the water was running brown for over 10 mins and I was late for work as i kept waiting for the water to clear. I was told when i checked in that the hotel water would be turned off the next day for a few hours but they didnt incidate that the water would be brown and murky. Had i known then i would have planned accordingly. This was very disappointing!,4,Verified traveler,2024-12-07

"O hotel é excelente. Para os padrões de NY o tamanho é muito bom. Tem uma mini cozinha, o que facilita e muito o fato de poder comprar alguns lanches para deixar no quarto. Tem móveis suficientes para deixar a estadia organizada e confortável, sem o amontoado de malas. A localização é nota 10, a pouquíssimos passos da Times Square, assim como de duas estações de metrô. Mesmo por ser numa localização muito central, a rua em si não é tumultuada. O fato de ter café da manhã também é muito válido, visto que é raro isso na cidade. Não tivemos o menor problema com lotação no café nem nos elevadores. Acho que poderiam melhor o serviço de quarto. Das vezes que foram arrumar só fizeram forrar a cama, trocar as toalhas e esvaziar os lixos. Sem mais, me hospedaria novamente sem pensar duas vezes. Ah, tivemos uma excelente vista do nosso quarto.

"My stay was fine until the end.  Room was clean and location was good.  However, check-out not great.  since check out time was 11 and they told me to request my car an hour in advance I checked out just before 10.  I stood in their lobby for almost 3 hours waiting for my car.  When I asked the manager about it he was very defensive and rude.  (He had not even requested my car yet and it was 11:30  Finally when my car came ( more than an hour later) another employee said I would get a refund for my parking since it took so long.  I was satisfied even though the rest of my travel plans were now delayed.   When I got home I saw that the $200 deposit that the hotel held for my 2 night stay was charged to my card instead of being refunded.  I called the hotel and was told that I had stayed past check out ( the front desk manager did not check me out of the hotel until he processed my refund after waiting so long for my car.).  
They are issuing a refund but I was told it will take another 10 days to receive my money.   
The hotel was fine but one guy ( who was also the guy in charge) did his job horribly left me and my daughters standing in the lobby for hours, was very rude, did not even request my car until and hour and a half later, did not check me out of my room when I checked out, held $200 from my account for an additional 10 days and delayed the rest of our trip. 
I will not stay here ever again. ",4,Robert,2024-12-04

El hosekiping en la habitación no es el mejor de lo demás perfecto ,10,Erika,2024-11-29
"It is a shame that such a nice looking, clean, convenient property has dropped the ball in so many ways. First of all, the elevator system in the building, which alleges to be more efficient, is not. There were many times that we were assigned a specific elevator and could not get on because too many people were assigned to the same elevator. Then, each time we couldn't get on the elevator, we had to go back to the screen and get a new elevator assignment. It was not unusual to have to wait for 2-3 elevators to pass by before we could get one.

As for the breakfast, to say it was subpar is an understatement. Tasteless frittatas, powdery eggs, and flavorless sausage were just some of the offerings. Also, the seating for the breakfast was woefully inadequate, just like the space in the elevators. 

Then there was the parking. There is no parking on the premises, so the hotel offers valet parking. Vehicles are parked in various nearby garages that are contracted with the hotel. When I made the reservation, I specifically asked whether there were in-and-out privileges for parked cars. I was told yes then, and I confirmed that information when I arrived at the hotel. However, when I took my car out to attend the scattering of my husband's ashes, I was charged an in-and-out fee. Also, the quoted daily parking fee of $85.00 DOES NOT include tax, which adds over $15.00 per day.

There are better-operated hotels in the same price range and in the same general area. Don't go here. ",6,Lawrence,2024-11-29

"O HILTON deveria ter vergonha de colocar seu nome institucional num empreendimento de tão baixa qualidade como este Hotel. Quarto imundo, no check in nem tem onde sentar para esperar, funcionários desqualificados e muito grosseiros. Incluindo gerentes também. O quarto é minúsculo e dizem que é ótimo no site. Achei tudo horrível demais. Preço alto da diária para o péssimo serviço que oferece. Correria no café para pegar mesa. Quando são 10:01 literalmente, expulsam os hóspedes da mesa. Olham de cara feia o tempo todo, viram a cara. Nunca vi nada igual.  Não há lugar no quarto para acomodar sequer as malas. Tudo imundo, cheio de poeira desde o 1o dia. Quanto à localização, não é um atrativo, em razão da péssima qualidade do hotel. 
Não conseguimos permanecer até o final da reserva. Buscamos outro hotel, mesmo já tendo pago. O hotel pratica verdadeiro estelionato nas propagandas que divulga. Se fosse no Brasil estaria ferindo grande parte do Código de Defesa do Consumidor. Por fim, as áreas comuns não tem qualquer conforto, bem como os quartos. Tiram as poucas cadeiras do hall para acomodar malas. Enquanto você espera o check in não tem um banheiro aberto para uso.",2,Beatriz A,2024-11-23

"It seems like my wife and I had issues from the start at this property. When we arrive from the airport to check-in our reservation was not in their system and it took almost an hour to get it figured out to where we were not double charged. After getting to our room we realized that the air conditioning was blowing out a foul smelling humid air. We contacted the front desk to see if anything could be done and they told us to open the window and a technician would come up. After about an hour of waiting we finally gave up at went to sleep. The next morning when we went down stairs I asked the front seat about the technician that never went to look at the ac and was told there was nothing they could do about the ac and we just needed to keep the window open if we wanted the room to be cooler. I advised the them that it was very noisy with the window open and it made it difficult to sleep, she shrugged and said, “sorry, there’s nothing I can do about the noise, it’s New York”. Then asked if there was anything else she could help with. I laughed and told her they haven’t helped with anything so how could she help with something’s else? She turned away from me and  began ignoring me and talking to her colleague. The room was also dirty, the floor turned our socks black on the bottom. They advertised a laundry by the gym downstairs (the reason we stayed here) and the was no laundry room. We were told they was only a dry cleaning service. Long story short, I wouldn’t recommend.

Salle de réception pour le petit-déjeuner sur 2 étages. Il faut être stratégique pour avoir des places, petit déjeuner peu diversifié mais bon ça passe, ma fille ado a peut manger. 
Personnel présent même en soirée comme le service technique.

"Very close to Times Square (so close you can hear it so if you’re a light sleeper this may not be best for you). Room clean and good size for location. Kitchenette very handy, good shower and toiletries provided. 
Breakfast is an added bonus but can get very busy and over crowded - the tables are so close together it’s hard to move. I collected breakfast and took it to the room in the end. 
Easy check in/out, staff friendly. Lift system is odd but you get used to it. Cannot comment on the gym as didn’t notice it until the last day! ",8,Paula,2024-11-04

"There were a few reasons we chose this hotel. 1) Location- can’t be beat here. You are within walking distance of Times Square, Madison Square Gardens, etc. 2) Free Breakfast- we had kids with us on this trip and thought we could save some money with this. It is nearly impossible to get food in the morning. They give you a suggested time for when it is less busy which of course is 6AM when it open. Very basic food. Be prepared to line up for the toaster and waffle machine. We had to take our food upstairs since there was never any seating. We ended up buying breakfast every day anyways.
The elevators are atrocious. If you are on a higher up floor, going down isn’t bad. But if you’re between 10 and ground level- several full elevators will pass you. To get from our 22nd floor room down to ground level
And back up is a 15 minute debacle. The rooms are just OK. What you’d expect. There is nothing special about this place for the price you are paying. This is our 5th visit to NYC and you couldn’t pay me to go back to this hotel. Lesson learned. ",4,Katrina,2024-11-03

"Unseren Aufenthalt möchten wir folgt bewerten:

Beim Einchecken mussten wir 700 Dollar Kaution per Kreditkarte hinterlassen. Dies hätte man uns bei der Buchung sagen müssen.

Die Person an der Rezeption hat uns die Zimmerkarten übergeben, aber nicht erklärt, wie man zum Zimmer kommt, geschweige denn den Aufzug bedient. Auch wurde uns nicht gesagt, auf welcher Etage sich unser Zimmer befindet.

Das Zimmer selbst war an sich in Ordnung und relativ modern gehalten.

Die Klimaanlage geht mitten in der Nacht an, egal wie oft man zuvor auf ""OFF"" gedrückt hat. 

Der Kühlschrank macht immer wieder ein lautes anhaltendes Geräusch, was uns in der ersten Nacht aufgeweckt hat.

Die Gardine in unserem Zimmer (Nr.: 1711) ist ganz offensichtlich defekt, da dieses nur mit enormen Kraftaufwand  hoch und runter gefahren werden kann.

Der Zimmerservice kommt nur alle zwei bis drei Tage einmal.

Das Frühstück ist minimalistisch gehalten. Nach dem zweiten Tag sind wir nur noch auswärts frühstücken gegangen. Was den Kaffee angeht, gibt es nur Filterkaffee.

"Money making hotel 50 meters from Times Square. Good rooms but Breakfast practically in the entrance lobby with coffee near the entrance doors, food partially behind the concierge and partially in the basement with hundreds of people gathering and frantically looking for a chair and a table where to sit is just crazy . An almost forty stories  hotel with hundreds of suites that have breakfast included in the price should have at least one floor dedicated to it and other amenities during the day! The price you pay deserves it!

物価高・円安の折り、朝食付きは有難いが、メニューがワンパターンで飽きてしまい、途中から食べなくなった。部屋は綺麗。ベッドも申し分ないが、洗面所がやや狭い。シャワーは固定なので、使いにくい部分があったが、お湯は必要なだけちゃんと出た。エアコンはなぜか定期的に轟音を伴うため、非常に耳障り。総合的にお値段相当のホテルだと思いますが、次にNY行く時は多分他のホテルを利用すると思う。,4,Mitsuko,2024-10-18
"A localização do hotel é excelente, tem uma loja de conveniência em frente, restaurantes. Fomos em 3 adultos e achamos o quarto pequeno, mas se não for um problema dá pra ficar. A cama de casal era confortável, mas o sofá cama para a terceira pessoa não é prático de abrir e não é muito confortável. O banheiro tinha um bom espaço porém o chuveiro estava espirrando água pra fora, a porta do box não fechava então molhava o banheiro todo. O shampoo acabou, a pessoa que fez a arrumação não percebeu, eu precisei pedir à equipe e logo em seguida me entregaram, porém no dia seguinte a equipe de limpeza veio arrumou o quarto mas não trocaram o shampoo no dispenser e ainda deixaram o quarto fedendo, parecia ser cheiro de suor. O problema dos elevadores é sério! Ficamos quase 20 minutos desistimos e decidimos descer pelas escadas, não imagino como foi para quem se hospedou nos andares mais altos... No fim, um dos rapazes da equipe que guardou nossas malas me indicou um taxista e disse que ele era contratado do hotel e que seria cobrado apenas 70 dólares, nada além disso, mas quando chegamos no aeroporto ele me cobrou 90! Argumentei mas ele disse que era aquilo e pronto. Ficamos muito chateados! Espero que o funcionário do hotel se responsabilize por essa péssima indicação.

My only compliant was the ""black out blind"" was not effective. The hotel is right off time square, we had a blinking sign close and our room was so bright we could easily navigate at night without turning on a light. We tried to rig something to block light around edge of window but were not successful. So bring an eye mask.
And a ""city view"" means street view if you are on floors one to ten, keep that in mind before you spend extra money. Otherwise a pretty solid hotel.

"Our room at this hotel was set up very odd.  We had to open a door from the hall that led into another hall that had two doors.  One on each size.  The overall room size was good, but the sofa bed was more of a twin that a double as described.  This made sleeping arrangements very odd and uncomfortable.  I asked about changing rooms only to be told very rudely that one wasn't available on either side.

"En réalité, c’est un hôtel de type aéroport pour visiter Time Square en son cœur car il est très bien placé.

"This hotel is very close to the main attractions which was nice... very walkable to different areas (if you are into exercising) but also very close to main subway lines.

Having a kitchenette was nice in the room even though there was breakfast every day as part of the room rate, it was nice to have a small size frig with a freezer for left overs and to add a few snack stuff.

The room was small with no drawers to put in clothes, so it was living out of a suitcase, which is okay if you are there for a few days but we were there for a week.

The room was somewhat clean... did find some spots on the tables, counters that were a little dirty, some 'hair' in the bathroom and dusty areas that were not cleaned.   It did not bother us.

It is a pricey hotel but you are getting a good location and a free breakfast. ",8,Pearl,2024-09-11

The elevators and breakfast were busy, but I suspect all the high rises had the same problems. I would have rated higher if we got a response to some of our issues. We had air problems and called for assistance without a response. It ended up as minor as we figured out the thermostat had a loose connection and was fixed when we adjusted it.

"HORRIBLE - À ÉVITER. J'ai payé très cher pour avoir une suite. Or, il s'agissait d'une chambre qui était minuscule. Il y avait bien un comptoir avec un évier, un frigo et un micro-ondes mais on ne pouvait même pas installer une table et il n'y avait qu'une seule chaise alors que nous étions 3. La climatisation et le système d'échange d'air étaient épouvantablement bruyants, même une fois la climatisation arrêtée. On se croyait dans un avion. Aucune intimité dans la minuscule salle de bain puisque la porte coulissante avait été installée à environ 4 cm du mur. Pas d'eau potable à notre étage et pas de fontaine. Il fallait redescendre pour en trouver. Le problème avec les ascenseurs mettait tout le monde en colère dès le matin. Ça pouvait prendre 15 à 20 minutes avant de pouvoir descendre. La salle à manger fermait à 10h00 le matin, beaucoup trop tôt en raison des problèmes d'ascenseurs et aussi parce qu'il n'y avait jamais de tables disponibles pour prendre le petit déjeuner. Beaucoup de clients devaient manger debout, utiliser les comptoirs dans le lobby, utilisaient même des bacs de tri sélectif comme table pour poser café ou jus d'orange. D'après moi, cet hôtel accueille beaucoup plus de clients qu'il n'est pas capable de servir correctement par la suite. ",2,Valerie,2024-08-26

"L’hotel è nuovo, in un ottima posizione( 1 minuti a piedi da time square) le camere sono fornite di forno a microonde, frigo e vari utensili da cucina. Le camere vengono rifatte un giorno si ed uno no e sono abbastanza “grandi”. All’arrivo bisogna lasciare una cauzione di 100 dollari a notte per tutta la durata del soggiorno che ti vengono restituiti dopo il check out ( se non si rompe nulla ovviamente!). Nel complesso è un bel l’hotel con un ottima posizione ha 2 difetti a mio parere: l’aria condizionata nella camera è veramente molto ma molto rumorosa e gli ascensori… la mattina, all’ora della colazione, per scendere in lobby e poi risalire in camera è un impresa! Attese lunghe per poter salire e scendere… ma nel complesso lo consiglio a chi vuole vivere la grande mela ed avere un buon punto di partenza.",8,Gian Paolo,2024-08-23

Am nächsten Tag in der Eile diese vergessen anzuziehen bzw. wegzuräumen, naja und dann war es auch schon um die Ohrringe - ich hab Sie nie nie nie wieder gesehen!! Also es wird super geputzt, alles weg! 

Ferner ist die Klimaanlage eine Zumutung, an aus - an aus - die ganze Nacht.  Also power dich richtig am Tag aus, sodass man erschöpft ins Bett fällt --

"Gut: Ausstattung mit Mikrowelle und Geschirr/Besteck

"Great location and clean, modern rooms BUT… AC was horrible and room would never drop below 73 and was musty. I hate to complain about this but somehow the small NYC sized suite was really stuffy and muggy. My wife and daughter used sheets only because it was so warm. I called twice and the engineer said that is what every room is like. My only other complaint is that the morning breakfast is a stressful mess. Way too few seats leave you standing and trying to eat in a chaotic scene. Also, the area is so small, no verification if your actually stay on at the hotel and way to little staff. The few staff members have to elbow their way through the crowd to see what is empty and then lines start forming awaiting refills. They actually have a waffle station which is insane. Please, pre-cook! It takes 3 minutes to make a waffle where most made two and…well do the math. The line was long and took 30 plus minutes to get a waffle. Making it worse, there was no room for a line and you are constantly pushed as people complain about, well, overall bad design.  We almost skipped the “free” breakfast because it was so stressful but instead decided to arrive at 7am instead of 9am. A side note to the hotel, remove the laundry bins from the seating are and have your plate removing staff move quicker. ",6,Jeffrey,2024-08-21

"Very clean room with everything you would need. Fridge, dishwasher, full size microwave with fully stocked cutlery. We had 3 people, one comfy bed and one pull out. Lots of room to pull out the table and have something to eat. Breakfasts were substantial but we decided to miss them due to the high volume/ wait at the lifts. Only downfall of the experience at this hotel. Well priced for within a block of Times Square and right next to all attractions. We had a 3 day stay and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Hotel staff were very friendly but took a lot of flak from guests who expected top class hotel services from a very budget friendly hotel. We would give them  9 out of 10. Just expect a wait at the elevators and you wont be disappointed. ",10,Sarah,2024-08-18

"Air conditioning unit in room 1317 was SO unbelievably loud and no matter what we set it to, it did whatever it wanted, (even when turned off it came back on in the middle of the night). Make sure to pack earplugs if staying in this room. Kitchen sink did not drain, water temperature wouldn’t really get hot or cold. Included breakfast was basic but fine. Contrary to what the signs in the hotel say, the “rooftop view” is definitely missable.",6,Allison Louisa,2024-08-17

"Similarly to a lot of previous reviews is nice hotel with a decent breakfast buffet style and nice compact rooms comfortable beds and anything you could possibly need. However the lifts (elevators) can get very busy in the morning, meaning those staying on lower floors can end up waiting upwards of 20 minutes to be able to get into a lift which isn't ideal for those who struggle to walk/ stand for long periods of time or anybody trying to manouver luggage. If your rooms are opposite the lifts then you can sometimes hear everyone's conversations whilst they wait for the lifts as the corridor is fairly narrow too.

"Tatsächlich hat uns das Hotel super gefallen. Die Lage, direkt am Times Square, war toll und dafür wirklich leise. Das Frühstück war gut. Nur ab 7:30 Uhr überfüllt. Im Keller gibt es einen weiteren Frühstücksraum. Dort kann man sich Waffeln machen. Das Personal war durchweg freundlich und nett. Die Zimmer waren schön und sauber. Wir hatten eine Aussicht auf die Straße/ Hard Rock Hotel und den M&M’s Store. 
Was leider ein großes Manko darstellte war die Lautstärke der Klimaanlage. Weshalb ich das Hotel trotz aller Annehmlichkeiten nicht wieder buchen würde. Die Klimaanlage springt automatisch (auch wenn sie abgestellt ist) immer wieder an. Es ist also kein durchgängiges Geräusch was man irgendwann überhören könnte. Ich habe die ersten Nächte maximal 3 Stunden geschlafen. Mit Oropax dann etwas mehr. Nach 5 Nächten konnte ich dann auch ohne schlafen. Wenn die Lautstärke der Klimaanlage irgendwie behoben werden könnte, würden wir sofort wieder dieses Hotel buchen. ",8,Desiree,2024-08-12

There are two things that are not great:

- There is way too little space in the breakfast room. It was completely overcrowded every single day, it was very hard to find a seat.

- The hotel has a ""fancy"" system of using the elevators, which does not work at all. In the busy morning hours, we sometimes had to wait 10-15 minutes until we could use an elevator. ",8,Peter,2024-08-10

During peak times we waited upwards of 15 minutes just to get on the elevator. There’s no way to bring breakfast back to your room, so If you plan on taking advantage of the included breakfast make sure your whole family is up by 6am to be down there by 6:30 or it gets too busy.

"The person at the front desk told us that the hotel was overbooked when we arrived. We were told that we would get $/night refund or Hilton points if we moved to the Hampton, which is in the same building. 
The room given to us was tiny. The breakfast was crazy busy. It's very hard to get the lift because it's so very busy all the time. 
To rub salt in the wounds, we never got our refund. The front desk staff basically lied to me and my wife. What's this world coming to?",2,Feroz,2024-08-04
"Excellent location, walking distance to Times Square, Theater District, Rockefeller Center and several subway stations. Very good restaurants nearby.

Property is well kept, rooms are convenient, yet small. Perfect for a family of 3. Cleaning for the room is made every other day. Ice and water machines plus all kitchen amenities in the room are convenient.

Breakfast is well served and, if you correctly manage your timings, very convenient.  As the property houses two hotels (Home2Suites and Hampton Inn) elevators can get difficult (yet manageable) at peak times, most notably around check-out time.

Overall service at the front desk is amicable and steadfast. Luggage can be stored on the day of your departure with good service by those in charge.

Excellent hotel in mid Manhattan with affordable prices.  ",10,Carlos,2024-08-04

The air conditioner was also very loud when kicking on and off, which is seemed to do continuously. The temperature in the room and noise from the air did make it difficult to sleep well. There was a false fire alarm issue one night at about 230a as well which was frustrating, but not the hotels fault. The room was very clean and fit our needs well. The couch pulled out into a bed, which we didn't realize when booking so that was a great surprise and saved my child sleeping on an air mattress. We skipped over the breakfast chaos but it looked to have good options. Elevator wait times were long, but we expected it as we were on the 33rd floor. As stated the location was perfect.

"The location of the hotel was what attracted us to it. It’s steps away from Times Square and a short walk to the theatres on Broadway. Our only issue was the temperature in the room, no matter how low we set the thermostat it was still very warm. The fire alarm also went off twice during our stay, once in the middle of the night and once early morning. If you are easily disturbed by loud noises, I don’t recommend you stay here as it gets very noisy with everything going on in Times Square and cars honking. However, if you’re after a central location this hotel is perfect. The breakfast buffet had a good selection, just make sure to get there early to secure seats. Also, the elevators use a new system which takes a little getting used to. Overall, a good stay and glad we chose this hotel for our trip.",8,Maria,2024-07-24

"This was an excellent location for us. We were on a higher floor and had no issues with the elevator at all. We also found our room to be very quiet even with being so close to Times Square.

I had a room that was waaay to noisy as you can hear every single car that pass by all night and the air conditioner system on each floor running and noisy. Requested a different room and that room was a bit better. Quiet from the traffic but still the air conditioner running on and off every 30 seconds makes it hard to sleep. Also the first night the TV wasn’t working at all. I was told that the nose from the air conditioner is normal on each floor. But that was not normal for me as it was hard to sleep with that noise.  ,8,Luis,2024-07-18

UND: wer in einem Höheren stockwerk ei. Zimmer hat wie wir auf dem 19 Stock Braucht viel glück das alle in den selben Lieft können, rechnet für den Lieft 5 bis 10 min ein, am Abreise Tag einen Mittwoch mussten wir fast 30 min warten für ein Lieft, die sind alle überfüllt und man hat fast nie Platz.

"If you can avoid it and pay a little more for a better hotel, I recommend it. This hotel has a more family appeal, with mini kitchens in the rooms, which means that the movement of people (family groups) is greater, but the hotel does not accommodate this, which causes queues in the elevators, at breakfast, at check-in and at checkout. The breakfast buffet borders on complete chaos, lack of seats and lack of food, given the number of people staying, in addition the variety is poor and does not take into account that many guests are foreigners such as Europeans and Latin Americans who have different tastes from traditional Americans. Many people wake up early to get their coffee and go up to their room, but there is still a queue even at 7am. Another problem is the elevators, we spent 10 minutes waiting for an elevator at 9 am and when it arrived it was crowded, as we were on the 4th floor we opted for the stairs and saw that we were not alone in the endeavor, as there was an intense flow of people on the stairs. A point of attention for those traveling by car, the valet service only appears after check-in, there is a small demarcation on the curb for you to stop the car and it only fits one car, in addition they warn that to pick up the car later you need to inform about 45 minutes in advance. Another detail, the rooms are cleaned every other day.",4,Karlos,2024-07-08

"Très bien situé, à une rue de Time Square, grand hôtel de près de 40 étages, moderne et propre. Côté équipements : nous étions 3 adultes dans la chambre (le second lit était un canapé lit dont le confort était inférieur à celui du lit double). Douche. Cuisine avec frigo four micro-ondes et machine à espresso. Grande tv LCD avec beaucoup de chaînes (dont celle qui diffusait tous les matches de l’euro 2024). 
Côté service : ménage effectué tous les jours (lits faits, poubelles vidées, serviettes de bain changées. 
Côté prestation : petit déjeuner inclus (self dans la salle commune au RDC). Petit bémol : choix faible et plats proposés identiques d’un jour sur l’autre. Les places étaient chères : il fallait impérativement être là avant 8h pour ne pas devoir batailler.

"Very good location. Room was good.
But the number of elevators doesn’t hold the amount of passengers the hotel has. When I went to the front desk to make a complain they accept that from 9:00 to 11:30 the elevators cannot hold the amount of passengers.
It took me 40 minutes waiting on the 15 floor until the elevator came to pick me up. When I went to see the option to take the stairs they where lots of passengers going down that way, because they couldn’t wait any longer. It’s was caos seeing the people waiting in each floor waiting for space in the elevator, that buy the way you up and down with A LOT of passengers .
I’m staying in that hotel anymore, and I don’t recommended

El hotel está muy bien ubicado y la habitación es muy buena.
Pero si quieres utilizar el elevador entre las 9:30 y 11:30 de la mañana. Podrás estar esperando en tu piso 40 minutos hasta que logres bajar en un ascensor.
Si tu salud te lo permite podrás hacer como otros pasajeros que bajaban por las escaleras, en mi caso tendría que haber bajado 15 pisos.
Por suerte no tenía que ir al aeropuerto o a un espectáculo, iba a desayunar, pero no legue a bajar cuando había terminado.
Cuando hice mi reclamo en el mostrador, reconocieron que durante ese horario, como hay mucha gente en el hotel tienen el problema que los ascensores no son suficientes.
Conclusión, no vuelvo a alojarme en ese hotel y no recomiendo que lo hagas. Solo si puedes subir y bajar muchas escaleras con facilidad

Frühstücken gingen wir auswärts da im Hotel die Bude jeden Tag laut und voll war, was aber verständlich ist. in der Nähe sind top Locations zum Abendessen. Rooftop Bar ist etwas Aufwendig zu erreichen, waren etwas unterbesetzt dafür waren die Preise für die Cocktails und kleinen Wurst und Käseplatten absolut OK für diese Lage und Qualität. würde ich wieder buchen",10,Philipp,2024-06-27

"Rooms were really nice-perfect for three. Breakfast was decent but very crowded. Hotel would not accommodate a late check out since I booked on Expedia-otherwise, they would have.

"Affordable for the location, 1 minute walk to Time Square. Alot of construction on the buildings right nextdoor, which cause extra noise super early am. Room was also a bit to small, no walking room between the bed and the table. We kept needing to move the chair back and fort to be able to get by. Pretty annoyed! ",6,Yesenia,2024-06-25

Hotel was off time sq and broadway. Very busy hotel. Free breakfast although it was V basic. You have to roam around to find a empty table. The elevator was really poor during peak times. The room A/C was so Loud than any hotel i have stayed in and the lowest temp was 20c/21c so it was hot and stuffy! The shower was like a garden sprinkler really poor. You need a good night sleep in hotel with the A/C and shower made it a really bad stay. Rather pay abit more to stay elsewhere.,4,Thomas,2024-06-20
施設、設備共にとても良い。Wi-Fiも速い。タイムズスクエアとブロードウェイにも近く、ヤンキースの試合観戦やミュージカルを観ても帰るのに全く問題無い。地下鉄を使って何処でも行ける。ただ、朝のエレベーターが混雑するのは、プログラムに問題が有ると思う。上層階をお勧めする。,8,TOMOAKI,2024-06-20

The location of this hotel was perfect.    The size of the room is larger than what we were expecting for being located inside of New York City in Times Square.   The breakfast food was nice and the basement floor had breakfast area as well.   The staff was most helpful at all times.  The elevator was not a problem - new age elevator - which in our opinion made things easier than stated in most reviews.  The a/c could not be turned down lower than 68 degrees - we kept the curtains closed to keep cool.  We would definitely stay at this hotel again.,10,CLETUS,2024-06-17

"Our room was small but very clean. We had a queen and a small pullout couch that was actually comfortable to sleep on. Had a small kitchenette with fridge, microwave and a few dishes. Nicest family hotel I have stayed at in NYC …and literally half a block from Time Square. Small store across the street and a little pizza joint. Elevators were a little weird but everything else was awesome!",10,Gena Maria,2024-06-09
"Front desk staff when we arrived was not friendly nor helpful but the luggage storage team was awesome. No warning about deposit of USD 300.

As others pointed, breakfast seating and elevator was a disaster with line up and slightly disarray of traffic flow in the dining area. Coffee is across the front desk, there's more seating area and more food variety downstairs. Water refill for big flask or water bottle needs to be done by the gym, not from water dispenser in the dining area. These were the things I've learned the hard way as there were no direction nor instruction but staff will sternly telling you. 

Location is awesome and room is fairly clean. I like the soundproof room and the view from our 31st floor. Night light of H and M building across for the bedroom. Bed is comfy but pillow is not my fave. Be prepare to bring your own toiletries. Our room had no toothbrush nor toothpaste, soap and shampoo dispenser were empty on the second day we were there. You may need extra dishwashing liquid if you plan to use it daily. We had trouble finding our room as it was tucked in between elevators. ",8,susanti,2024-06-09

Mesmo com todas essas considerações, recomendo e me hospedaria novamente. ",10,Arno Alexandro,2024-06-06
"   The check-in was quick and efficient.  The desk clerk was friendly and proficient.  (We were uncertain about how to operate the room key elevator access, because there was no explanation, but we figured it out rather quickly.)
   All lobby staff, cleaning personnel, and breakfast crew were first class.  All were courteous and helpful.
   Our rooms were well maintained and comfortable, with nice amenities, including refrigerator, microwave, dishes, eating utensils and dishwasher.  The beds were comfortable, and the air conditioners functioned well.
   The breakfast, which was included in the stay, was plentiful and hot, with a nice variety of items.  A bonus offering was packaged breakfast sandwiches, which we took to our rooms for snack items later in the day. 
   The location was superb.  We were very close to Times Square, theaters, Rockefeller Center, and subways.  It was easy to get around and see numerous sights.
   We enjoyed our stay at Home 2 Suites, Time Square, and we will consider it again when we return to NYC.",10,Christine D,2024-06-05
"A única vantagem deste hotel é a localização na Times Square. Os locais de uso comum do hotel estão totalmente subdimensionados em relação ao número de hóspedes que o hotel recebe. Os elevadores estão sempre lotados e o espaço reservado ao café da manhã  um “salve-se quem puder”. Na há espaço nem mesas e cadeiras suficientes. As pessoas chegam ao local e precisam esperar até que surja uma vaga para sentar. Muitos se posicionam junto aos que estão já sentados , aguardando que estes saiam, causando até um certo constrangimento. Neste mesmo local, ou seja o espaço do café da manhã, há aglomerações junto aos locais onde estão os alimentos, com pessoas esbarrando umas nas outras. ",6,Cléo,2024-06-05

"Do not stay here! The rooms are smaller than tiny! The AC is locked on fan mode and won’t go below 69. They promised they would send an engineer to look at the air and never did. Our parents had a room in the same HOTel and had the same AC issue. There wasn’t enough space to walk around, our room never got cleaned (stayed 3 nights) and the bathroom was smaller than a porta potty. 

Valet parking is the only option and costs more than $100 per night. We drive 2 vehicles, and the truck was brought around as soon as we were ready to check out. It took them an additional 30 minutes to bring our explorer. After loaded both vehicles and watching the valet manager awkwardly watch us load, I tried to crank the explorer and it wouldn’t crank. Long story short, the valet drivers admitted to having to jump it off in order to bring it to us that morning. The car was completely fine before being parked by them. 

We will never stay at this hotel again, and will probably never stay in a Hilton again. ",2,Amber,2024-06-04

"The air conditioning didn't work, it was too hot in the room, I reported the fault and the technician said he tried to repair it but couldn't do more. For what they charge, the service is bad. I would not stay at this hotel again. I do not recommend it",2,Valeria Andreina,2024-05-25
Bartender Karen was great. Elevators took forever or sometimes didn’t even come despite having like 6 elevators. Rooms were always humid a/c didnt help because it would adjust on its on and never stay on. Hair on the window handle but it still wasn’t that bad of a stay. ,6,Caleb,2024-05-25

"It was a minute walk to Times Square. Everything was in walking distance. If you needed to go in distance there were subway entrances in almost every corner, which made it so easy. Coffee and creamer were available 24/7. Breakfast was served in a buffet, so if you want less crowds go early. There's plenty of food, so no need to go early, if you don't mind a small crowd. Elevators are sometimes booked, but with everyone on vacation and feeling good, the wait isn't so bad with good company. A great overall experience!",10,Lawrence,2024-05-24
"The air conditioner is growling all night. Had to turn it off to sleep. But then its getting hot. Every hour I get to wake up to turn on for couple of minutes to cool down the room.

Hablé amablemente con el  manager en turno, disculpe por mi error y las molestia haya provocado y pregunte si había la posibilidad una consideración en la tarifa por la noche adicional, ya que me pareció muy elevada.
Y fue muy grosero y déspota para decirme que no era posible hacer una reconsideración en la tarifa.
Eran las 10:30 de la noche yo con mis dos hijos menores y me dijo “si no te parece haz tu check out ahora mismo   y ve buscar en todo Nueva York a ver donde encuentras una habitación disponible, está lleno no hay nada y no te puedo hacer ninguna mejora, tienes que apegarte a la tarifa publica.

Me hizo sentir mal, creo me puedo hacer dicho lo mismo con palabras más amables.

"O hotel é muito bom, com grande conforto, bem novo mas tem alguns probleminhas que atrapalham. A cama de casal é bem boa, a cama do sofá-cama apesar de ser de mola, é bem fina, então não é excelente. Os travesseiros são muito baixos. A cozinha é bem útil para reduzir os custos de alimentação. A localização é ótima, bem perto da Times Square. O maior problema são as áreas comuns. O hotel é bem grande (32 andares) e existem poucos elevadores para a quantidade de hóspedes (dependendo do horário, é possível ficar esperando 15 minutos), assim como a área de café da manhã (fica bem cheio a manhã toda). O café é bem melhor que o normal de NY mas não tem tanta variedade. No final das contas, achei um ótimo custo benefício.",8,CRISTIANO,2024-05-22

"Hotel muito novo, dentro da da região da Times Square, em frente ao Hard Rock Cafe. Os atendentes extremamente atenciosos. Banheiro bom, bem iluminado, com box e até hidratante corporal, sabonete de rosto. Mini cozinha com Geladeira grande, microondas, louças, talheres, cafeteira com blends de chá e café.  Não tem carpete, excelente para que tem alergia. Excelente comparado aos hoteis antigos da região. Vamos ao campeão de reclamação que quase me fez desistir do hotel, os elevadores. Sim, demoram! O problema não é a falta de elevadores e sim o sistema adotado, fiquei no 34 andar e as vezes ele vinha parando em todos os andares. Vi pessoas subindo pela escada. De 10 dias que fiquei lá, só desci para o café da  2 vezes pois não faço questão. Mas realmente é tumultuado mas você pode subir com o que quiser para o quarto e tomar la. Café da manhã em hotel é um luxo em NY, então é uma boa economia para que come bem na manhã. O dia que desci, já não haviam muitas coisas. Se descer cedo, vai comer bem. Em resumo, eu ficaria novamente se o preço estiver bom. Entre ele e o Edson por exemplo que tem localizações privilegiadas, ficaria com Home2 novamente. 
Foi melhor do que eu esperava.

"Aspetti negativi:
1) Check-in: avevamo prenotato una camera tripla (3 adulti) ma ci hanno dato la camera 717, che è una doppia.
Dopo le mie rimostranze, ci hanno mandato nella camera 614, dove il terzo letto era un divano: non c'erano lenzuola e, se ci fossero state, avremmo dovuto rifare il letto da soli.
Dato il jet-lag abbiamo deciso che tanto valeva andare a letto e noi (3 uomini adulti) abbiamo finito per condividere un letto matrimoniale: siamo amici, quindi nessun problema di privacy, ma c'erano comunque problemi di spazio personale
2) La sala colazioni è organizzata su due piani: piano terra e seminterrato. Qui sotto gli ospiti fanno colazione accanto a enormi vasche piene di biancheria sporca o di mobili rotti (vedi foto).
3) Colazione: poco varia: un piatto di uova (strapazzate o frittata), uno di carne (salsiccia, hamburger o bacon), uno di patate.
Niente salumi, salmone o altri tipi di pesce, niente formaggio (suvvia: il Philadelphia non è formaggio!), niente dolci (se si eccettuano alcuni muffin)
Idem per le bevande: solo tè nero, niente tè verde o altre tisane. Succhi di frutta: o arancia o mela.
4) L'impianto di aria condizionata fa un rumore fastidioso anche se spento, ma si avvia automaticamente in piena notte, così ho dovuto alzarmi 2 o 3 volte OGNI SINGOLA notte per spegnerla. Ho chiamato la manutenzione e il tizio che è arrivato ha detto che l'impianto di AC non può sconnettersi e che le cose non possono essere cambiate.

"Notre séjour à l’hôtel a été à la fois satisfaisant et décevant. L’emplacement au cœur de Times Square était idéal pour explorer la ville, mais quelques aspects ont terni notre expérience. Bien que la chambre soit bien équipée, elle était trop petite pour accueillir confortablement trois adultes, ce qui a été un inconvénient pour notre groupe. De plus, malgré notre chance d’être logés au cinquième étage, les ascenseurs étaient souvent encombrés, ce qui entraînait des temps d’attente désagréables. Le petit-déjeuner laissait également à désirer, avec une sélection limitée et une qualité médiocre, en particulier pour les jus d’orange et de pomme. Les heures de pointe étaient particulièrement stressantes en raison de l’afflux de clients. Dans l’ensemble, bien que l’emplacement soit un point fort, ces inconvénients ont conduit à une note de 3/5 pour notre séjour.",6,Aissa,2024-05-03

"Was quite bad.
The room was paid for 3. The third place was not a bed but a coach. Why not. But the matress of the convertible was very very poor. And worst : when convertible is open : you cannot, at all, circulate in the room. You are literaly blocked.
I have asked to change the matress : no way.
The room was very small and with too many furnitures you do not need in such small room. I have asked to remove some : no way

There is not enough lifts for the number of rooms in the hotel. Ypi have to wait each morning at least 15 min. A nightmare.

Breakfast is crowded. Very difficult to seat. You have to queue for everything. The room.is too small and not sized vs hotel capacity. Only one orange juice machine which is down every 5 minutes. And.nobody from the staff care. I was several time claiming to management. Whi does not care more.

I do NOT recomend this hotel.",4,Nicolas,2024-05-01

"Great location, close to Times Square, close to the metro.  For a busy town, the room was quiet.   It iwas great to have a proper microwave, a dishwasher, and a fridge. Breakfast was well provisioned, with an egg choice, sausage choice, and a potato choice each day, rotating every three days.  There was bread, muffins, toast, a waffle maker, fruit. 
However, a couple of concerns:
- as many of the other reviews already mentioned, the wait for the elevators is really long.  They have this new system where it is automatically determined which elevator you should go to.  However, I'd like to see the algorithm, as it isn't at all efficient.  There's almost always a crowd of 10-20 people waiting in the lobby for the elevator, and long waits on the floors as well.
- Even though in the room, on a sticker on the bathroom windows, it mentions that beds will be made every other day and the kitchen will be refreshed, etc...  We had a 5 night stay, the beds were made once on day 4, and nothing was cleaned at all during our stay.  We asked for clean sheets so at least we could refresh the beds - but only half the sheets showed up.  We asked for a dishwasher pod so we could do the dishwasher, but that never showed up.  We did get fresh towels twice and the garbage was taken twice as well.   
- I was told that the security hold can take up to 7 days to be refunded.
- the breakfast area esp after 8am is very crowded and it is hard to find a table, and there can be long lineups for the food. ",6,Henriette,2024-04-22
"The lift system is confusing. Even they have 9 lifts. Still have to wait quite long time for the lift.
Shower pressure is not great. Air conditioning fan is noisy. Worse still you can not turn it off. It will come on automatically. Breakfast is poor quality plus there isn’t enough seating.

"A block away from Times Square is convenient. However the elevators in this building are horrible. You have to choose from a block of floors on a screen then the screen will tell you what elevator to go to. Often by the time you get to that elevator, the door is closing or closed. Other times you wait for three to four minutes for it to never arrive. You go to the screen again and it tells you to go to a whole new elevator. A group of us waited 14 minutes on the 23rd floor trying to get down for breakfast. The computer told us two different elevators that never came. Breakfast was just okay. On my last day they had no juice. They said the machine was making it warm. You would think a back up plan would be to buy cartons of juice and put them on ice. The management clearly doesn't have any contingency plans in place. The water was completely empty. There were 6 coffee pots and all were empty. A manager was walking around but not paying attention to any of this. So when you see Hilton touting ""breakfast included"" just know it's not gonna be great.",6,Christopher,2024-04-17

"Brand new hotel located right in the centre of Times Square so 10/10 for Location. 
Hotel building including Restaurant, Reception, Bar and Elevators are shared with Hampton Inn.
Expect long waiting times (20-30 mins) if you are making your way for Breakfast in the morning between 9.00 -10.00. We were on the 35th Floor and the Elevator stopped on every floor and there were people waiting and getting frustrated. During the day this is not such a big issue and the 5-6 Elevators are sufficient. 
Breakfast is an absolute nightmare and we only went for breakfast on the 1st day out of our 7 day stay. With the long waiting time for Elevators followed by another long queues for Breakfast (seperate long queues for Juice and Waffles) and then no tables to sit and eat, we could not dare to go through this stress everyday. 
Room service was decent but after asking for Hand Wash twice they could not top this up. 
Room is not big enough for more than 2 Adults, we had my daughter with us and although they have sofa bed in the room, once this is out there is absolutely no space to move at all. We struggled with this throughout the week and especially with 3 big luggages it was very inconvenient.
Overall apart from the Location nothing was outstanding so 3 Stars for 3 Star Hotel.",6,P,2024-04-14

"The hotel is in a great location, the staff is approachable and helpful.
What they should definitely improve is the breakfast, which is the same every day, without any variety, and the biggest minus of the hotel is the fire alarm that goes off several times a day, even at night. It's really scary because you don't know if it's a false alarm or if something is going on. In any case, it raises the stress level.",6,Eva,2024-04-09
Otelin konumu tahmin ettiğimden çok daha iyiydi. Personeli Amerika’da rastladığım en güzler yüzlü ve yardımsever personel olabilir. Oda genel olarak sessizdi cumartesi gecesi hariç ☺️ Yatak konforluydu. Otelin bana göre eksikleri oda içinde terlik yoktu ve kahvaltısı sıkıcıydı. Meyve suyu makinesi arızalandı ama iki gün servis olmadı. Bir çözüm getirilmedi. Genel anlamda oldukça rahat bir konaklamaydı. ,10,Serpil,2024-04-08

Il personale è stato gentile e attento. La colazione buona e abbondante, con varie scelte di dolce e salato. Un po’ piccolina la sala colazioni considerando la gran quantità di persone da ospitare la mattina. La nostra camera era molto spaziosa, dotata di tutto il necessario e pulita. Una grande pecca: il sistema di ventilazione che si accendeva automaticamente ogni notte con un rumore davvero troppo forte, rendendo necessario alzarsi 2-3 volte per spegnerlo. ",8,Laura,2024-04-04

"This is a very basic hotel. The lobby is extremely crowded a lot of the time, wait time for the elevators is excessive. The heating/ cooling unit in our first room was extremely loud, sounded like a jackhammer. After the first night of no sleep, we were moved to a new room and the heating/cooling unit simply didn't work. Their engineer apparently ""fixed"" it, but it only worked for a few hours then quit again. It was too much hassle to move again, so we just sucked it up. It was tolerable because the weather was cool, but if it had been any warmer or colder outside it would have been an issue. No working phones in either room so we couldn't call the front desk about any of the issues and had to go down in person, and wait with the aforementioned crowds, every time we needed to talk to them.  We wasted a lot of precious vacation time. 

The staff were very friendly and tried their best to help, but even the maintenance guy admitted this is a known issue and there isn't much they can do. 

The hotel is also missing a lot of very basic conveniences that i would normally expect from a hotel. The kitchenette is a nice bonus, for the price we paid, but i wouldn't stay there again.",6,Alison,2024-03-28

Each should service certain floors (one for 1-10, one for 11-20, etc) because people get impatient and request their floor multiple times then you end up stopping on nearly every floor. Breakfast is BUSY but the staff does a great job of keeping up. The bar is a rip off. The bartender asked us if we wanted water, we said yes and she poured a bottle into a glass and charged us $5!!!

"Très bien placé si l'on souhaite être proche de times square et des transports. 
Effectivement la zone de petit déjeuné ne dispose pas d'assez de place, et la deuxième salle du bas sert de stockage aux bacs de linge sale ce qui n'est vraiment pas agréable.
Le petit déjeuné est correct en comparaison de certaines autres propositions sur Manhattan.
Les chambres sont biens équipées (attention les kitchenettes ne disposent pas de plaques)
Les ascenseurs peuvent parfois poser problème a l'heure du petit déjeuner, une seule fois nous avons réellement du attendre 10 minutes pour descendre ( 34 ème étage) mais souvent les problèmes sont du a la mauvaise utilisation par les clients de la tablette de commande des ascenseurs.
Nous n'avons pas du tout été gené par le bruit des climatisation, et les chambres sont bien insonorisées.
Le bémol est la chambre qui a du être faite 2 fois sur 8 jours, il a fallut demander a chaque fois pour avoir un peu de produit lave vaisselle, et nous sommes resté 8 jours sans réussir a avoir une éponge.

"Um hotel novo com potencial para ser um bom hotel no entanto oferece um serviço mau para um hotel de 3 estrelas do grupo Hilton.

1- a 3a cama do quarto é um sofá cama com zero conforto onde se sentem todas as molas e travessas metálicas da estrutura.

2 - o mesmo sofá cama estava fechado e não pronto para a 3a pessoa à chegada. Questionado o hotel estes dizem que a cama tem que ser feita pelos próprios clientes, sendo que apenas disponibilizam o têxtil de cama.
3- ao 2o dia, voltam a fechar o sofá cama e novamente deixam os lençóis dizendo, rudemente, que os hospedes é que têm que fazer a cama para dormir.

4- a ventilação está ligada toda a noite, mesmo que desliguemos o AC, esta segue em funcionamento, produzindo muito ruído.

5 - os elevadores são insuficientes para o numero de hóspedes, pelo que por vezes é necessário esperar mais de 15 minutos por um que caibamos, nas horas de mais fluxo. Num 17 andar torna-se desconfortável usar as escadas.

5 -a sala do pequeno-almoço, embora com um espaço grande, é insuficiente para o número de de hóspedes do hotel…

Em suma, um hotel para massas em que o serviço, menos que básico, parece mais um favor que o hotel faz aos hóspedes!!!

"Pluses: Location is great, clean, good-sized rooms for Manhattan, quiet. 
Cons: weird elevator system can have you frustrated and using the stairs. We waited so long that we would just use the stairs for 11th floor, but if you are high up it's going to be frustrating. Going up, you tell it what floor at a main panel in lobby and it tells you which elevator to use. Because of the way they do the elevators, your elevator stops at a bunch of floors nobody gets out at because they didn't know to get in. It's a sh*tshow. 
The elevators and the cramped breakfast serving area are hard to negotiate. ",8,Catherine,2024-03-17

"I am writing to inform you about my stay at Home 2 Suites Hilton NY Times Square, from 2/9/24 until 2/19/24.
I checked in 2/9/24, at almost 11:00pm.  When me and my family arrived at my room 616, the sofabed was not ready, and no towels, blanket, pillows for the third person.  I went to the reception desk and they said that someone will bring all this stuff.  But almost midnight I have to go another time at reception desk asking all this items again. All this after a long trip from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I could not rest, I had to wait someone to bring all items that in my opinion had to be in the room when guests arrived,
For my surprise, the air conditioning was very noise, and the last night of my stay on 2/18/24, thanks God, I met Samara (Hilton manager), that saw a baggage of trash in my room, the sofabed gets the impression that someone slept there, and forgot to take the trash out of the room. Samara went to my room 3 times this night, because even asking what was missing in my room, they did not bring the items that we asked for. I think it is unacceptable. Look my room when me and my family arrived. We leave at 9:30am and arrived at 6:00pm.  In this morning I have asked reception desk for dish soap, empty trash, as all days, but it seems that the team is ""flying"", their thoughts are in another place, not in making a good job for the guest.

A estrutura do hotel é ótima, tudo muito novo e funcionando perfeitamente, além da localização que achei perfeita! Bem perto da times square mas não tão perto a ponto de ter muito barulho e muitas pessoas, assim consegui andar para muitos pontos turísticos sem depender do metrô.

"La ubicación del hotel es increíble. Está justo en times Square y con muy buenas conexiones. Tiene una muy buena insonorización de la calle, no hay que preocuparse del ruido de la calle.
El hecho de tener desayuno es muy cómodo pero hay que saber que las mesas son limitadas y casi siempre está muy lleno de gente y encontrar mesa para sentarse es complicado.
La habitación es cómoda pero el aire acondicionado hace un ruido insoportable. A lo largo de todo el día se activa un motor durante unos minutos que hace muchísimo ruido. En nuestro caso, por la noche nos ha llegado a despertar porque es fuertísimo.
Calidad precio está muy bien, si arreglan el aire será excelente.",8,IRENE,2024-02-25

"Quarto pequeno pra 1 casal e uma adolescente devido ao espaço para malas. Porém , não conheço quarto grande em Manhattan. Mas, se organizar direito fica tranquilo . Hotel novo , cama e sofá cama confortável. O sofá cama só cabe uma pessoa . O banheiro limpo , grande com box. Localização incrível , próximo a várias linhas de metrô . Desceu você já está “ de cara” pro MM e Olive Garden . Café da manhã bem americano com waffles , pães , torradas , sanduíche pronto , frutas , mingau , ovos ( mexidos ou omelete) suco de marquina , iogurtes , café , chocolate quente . No período que fui ficava na refeição chocolate quente e chá a vontade a qualquer hora . Café da manhã é cheio, 2 máquinas apenas para waffles o que forma uma fila . Mas, vc pode pegar seu café e comer no quarto . Os elevadores cheios . Tivemos problemas apenas no check out ficamos uns 10 min para conseguir pegar elevador pra descer .",10,Patricia R,2024-02-19
"This hotel is in a great location! We walked pretty much everywhere and if we needed to go farther, the subway was close by. The breakfast area gets crowded fast and stays busy so get there early. The staff did a great job serving breakfast and clearing tables for the next person. The only complaint we had was in our room. There weren’t enough pillows and the comforter shed white fuzziness all over our clothes. Also, the pull out bed was quite uncomfortable and small, but my 10 year old managed. Overall, great experience in a clean hotel and nice staff!",8,Eva,2024-02-19

"We reserved a handicap accessible room with roll in shower. When we reserved it the reservation showed that we would have a pulled out sofa bed. Upon registration, we were told that the corner rooms (which we did not request) did not have a sofa bed. They did not have any other rooms to offer us.  They said they could not bring in a cot or anything. We ended up making a bed for my son using a chair and stool and extra pillows placed next to our bed. The bed was also so low to the ground my husband, who is a wheelchair user, could barely get back in his wheelchair after getting in bed for the night. The fire alarm went off several times during our stay, as well, which is very scary as a wheelchair user not being on the ground floor. Staff did not seem concerned about our complaints to the front desk. We were only there for 4 days so we just made it work but doubtful we will ever choose this hotel again. ",6,Jessica,2024-02-19

Caos do cafe da manha.. após 9:00am é impossível devido a qtde de pessoas. Se desejar um pouco mais de conforto, apenas entre 6:00am e 7:00am
A “automação ?”  dos elevadores é a pior possível ! Reserve 30min para conseguir pegar um elevador nos horarios de pico, que são vários (entre 8:30am  e 11:00am) (entre 5:00pm e 7:00pm) e qdo algum deles não está funcionando",4,Andre,2024-02-18

A principal questão para mim foi a lotação do elevador nos horários de pico eles não atendem a demanda. Cheguei a esperar por 6 elevadores e todos vieram lotados, precisei adotar outros meios para descer, minha solução geral foi procurar fugir desses principais de horários. ",8,Mariana,2024-02-12

"I stayed at this hotel with my family, and we didn’t have a relaxed experience. Although the location of the hotel in the city couldn’t be more perfect, the hotel itself was stressful and uncomfortable at times. Due to the air vent system on every room, we had to have the engineer come 4 times to fix the loud noise that made the room unable to sleep in. The noise was unbearable if not fixed every couple of days, and it created stress and uncomfortableness. Additionally, there was a flood in a superior floor, which leaked in our room through the walls, and made it so that we had to change rooms in the middle of our stay. The staff was very kind and helpful, but the structure of the hotel building was poorly done. 
If you have food allergies, I wouldn’t recommend the hotel breakfast, since they only have 1 gluten-free option, and very few dairy-free ones.
Overall, there were many things that added stress into our stay in the city, instead of providing a calm and comfortable place to stay. ",4,Maria,2024-01-29
"Nice complete kitchen , location is right Times Square so  not very quiet, the m&m big screen is flashing in my window even when my curtains are closed, not a big deal as long as you bring a sleep mask.

The location was very good for Times Square, the subway, restaurants, and the theatres.  The elevators took a little bit to get used to but were fine.  The only concern that we had was that the fire alarm continually went off.  There is a lot of ""cry wolf"".  They were very good at informing us of what the status was, but it happened at all hours of the day and night.  My concern is that if it was a real emergency, people lose valuable time evacuating the building when they figure it is another false alarm.

"Sehr zentral gelegenes Hotel in unmittelbarer Nahe von Times Square und Broadway, das per U-Bahn auch gut vom Flughafen aus zu erreichen war. Wir konnten dadurch in Manhattan sehr viel erlaufen. Die Zimmer waren klein, aber schön eingerichtet. Mit Küchenzeile und Kühlschrank, was sehr angenehm war. Das erste Zimmer haben wir nach der ersten Nacht wechseln können (weil die Lüftung noch viel lauter und unruhiger als in den anderen Zimmern lief). Im zweiten Zimmer hat sich eine Rolle des Schreibtisches während unseres Aufenthaltes verabschiedet. Und die Schiebetür des Bades hat ständig gehakt. Einmal ist sie uns beim Öffnen aus der Schiene gesprungen und entgegen gefallen. 
Das Frühstück war für amerikanische Verhältnisse eher üppig. Es gab sogar eine Theke mit abgepackten belegten Brötchen / Bagels zum Mitnehmen. Kaffee und Tee standen auch nach dem Ende der Frühstückszeit zur Verfügung. 
Die Mitarbeiterinnen waren in allen Bereichen sehr hilfsbereit und bemüht. Die kleine Rooftop-Bar des Hotels haben wir auch einmal besucht. Insgesamt ein wirklich gutes Preisleistungsverhältnis für diesen Standort.",8,Katja,2024-01-18

Elevators are a nightmare in this hotel. Strange setup where you cannot just get on an elevator and choose to go to your floor or the lobby. No buttons inside the elevator. Need to plan for 15-30 minutes just to catch an elevator to go from your floor to the lobby every morning and then from lobby to your floor at the end of the day. Most ridiculous hotel experience I have ever had.,4,Ashlee,2024-01-04

"Hôtel très correct, 48 étages, à 2 pas des spectacles de Broadway. Chambre propre, un peu petite pour 3 personnes. Une fois le canapé déplié il reste peu de place pour circuler. Petit déjeuner à volonté avec un personnel dévoué. Mais à la réception c’est autre chose. Ils ne sont pas très arrangeants. À l’arrivée mieux vaut que votre carte bancaire passe du premier coup car même si vous pouvez payer la totalité du séjour en cash, ils ne l’acceptent pas et n’hésitent pas à écourter ou annuler votre séjour. Et à la sortie, impossible de laisser les bagages dans une bagagerie pour profiter de la dernière journée, ils n’en ont pas. Vous devez quitter l’hôtel dans les 10 minutes. Pas possible non plus d’attendre votre famille à la réception. Un vigile est venu me demander d’attendre dehors avec tous les bagages puis est revenu une minute plus tard avec un policier trouvé dans la rue pour me convaincre de quitter l’hôtel. 🙁",8,Olivier,2024-01-03

"The positives: location (close to the action, just next to Times Square). And the room was clean. And that’s it.

The negatives: Everything else. What a terrible hotel. Never experienced anything like it before and hope I don’t again. 
- We arrived to a lobby that looked like an airport where all the flights were cancelled. People everywhere and no space to move. After queuing we were told our room still wasn’t  ready so we had a further 40 mins in the lobby with bags and kids. The lifts are chaos, you have to wait forever for one to arrive.
- the room was tiny. No space to move. One of the pieces of furniture was broken. There was a tucked away dining table with no space to sit around. There was a kitchenette with a drawer full of utensils to be used with an oven and cooktop. But guess what? There is no oven or cooktop, just a microwave. 
The safe in the room is at the bottom of the wardrobe by the bed. Almost inaccessible.
The room is only cleaned every other day. And the air conditioning in the room is so loud you can’t sleep (and it can’t be turned off).
- if you want to ring reception you can’t: phone was out of order on all lines
- the tiny corridor was piled high with garbage every morning
- breakfast area is tiny and you queue forever to eat (and allow 10 mins to wait for lift)  There is a single waffle machine for a hotel with 37 floors!
- Staff unhelpful. They offered a bottle of water and bag of chips for all the issues!?!

"Solicite una habitacion con capacidad de 4 personas (2 adultos y 2 niños).  Tenia una cama queen y un sofa cama para una sola persona, con lo cual, estabamos apretados e incomodos en la habitacion.  Abrir el equipaje era todo un tema por la falta de espacio.  De verdad me duele decir que al final de nuestros dias de paseo, no sentia emocion alguna en ir a descansar a mi habitacion de hotel por la incomodidad que representaba.  Finalmente, hay horarios en que es dificil poder conseguir un ascensor, sobre todo en los horarios de desayuno.  En varias ocasiones optamos por bajar las escaleras desde un piso alto.  El desayuno esta incluido en la tarifa, pero se llena muchisimo y en un horario entre 8 y 10 am es dificil encontrar mesa.  Finalmente, el dia de mi entrada al hotel, llegamos en la madrugada, cansados despues de largo viaje internacional, y la persona del counter de entrada no era muy amable, hubo mucha demora en la entrada, me calculo tarifas que no eran las ofrecidas por Hotels.com, tuve que pedir correccion.  La ventaja mas grande del hotel es la ubicacion, la cual es excelente, pero no me quedaría nuevamente en él.  ",6,Yazmina,2023-12-26

Very convenient to Time Square area.  Breakfast was good enough to get us going for the day.  Eggs were usually beat option.  Elevators take some getting used to!  Staff was always helpful and pleasant.  The heat air and air system is awful.  Can't set below 68 so often jad to open windows for cool air.  Fan seems to cycle on and off about every 30 seconds so sound is annoying... mentioned at checkout and was told engineers can trick system to bypass...so should have complained!  If that can be fixed then plus plus!  Fire alarm went off one night and someone came on and said something like we think false alarm but will give update but no update ever received.  ,6,Lori,2023-12-24

"Dans l’ensemble c’était un très bon séjour ! 
L’emplacement de l’hôtel est vraiment son plus gros point fort !! 
Nous étions au 26e étage face au magasin M&M’s , la chambre est très bien insonorisée ! 
Elle n’est pas très grande mais bien agencée et fonctionnelle. 
Nous avons eu un léger problème technique, je pense lié aux travaux récents de l’hôtel (porte de la salle de bain coulissante qui était bloquée) mais cela a été directement pris en charge par le personnel ! Quand nous manquions de serviettes, draps… Ils ont tout de suite pris les choses en main ! 
Le personnel est très accueillant ! 
Le petit déjeuner est varié et copieux, il faut effectivement venir tôt je pense si on veut pouvoir s’installer tranquillement, l’hôtel nous donne d’ailleurs un petit prospectus à l’arrivée expliquant les heures d’affluence 

Le seul point négatif de ce séjour c’est comme lu dans certains commentaires la vmc bruyante de la chambre mais avec des bouchons d’oreilles, j’ai pu dormir paisiblement ! ",8,Megane,2023-12-17

I was not informed that a $100 charge per night would be required upfront for incidental fees. It was an expense I did not plan for and was a little put off by it. It seems like them having a credit card on file would be substantial enough if any further expenses occurred. I will be sure to ask this upfront with any future bookings. ,8,Rachelle,2023-12-15

"Atendimento excelente e cordial por parte de todos os funcionários, ficamos hospedados por 10 noites.
Localização perfeita com todas as facilidades necessárias próximas.
O café da manhã é excelente, muito farto, mas os melhores horários são os primeiros do dia... das 06h até umas 08:30h, após a lotação é certa.
Infelizmente o barulho relacionado a ventilação e ar condicionado, mencionada em outras avaliações procede e incomoda um pouco. Como nossa viagem ocorreu em um período de muito frio eu desliguei a ventilação e o barulho diminuiu muito, praticamente não ocorrendo a noite. Outro ponto muito falado é sobre os elevadores, não vi nenhum problema, são modernos e o sistema usado é automatizado para agilizar o uso e distribuição dos andares. Lotação em elevador e café da manhã acontece em todos os lugares em horários de pico e fins de semana.
Um ponto de melhoria a ser apontado é o serviço de arrumação do quarto, não é padronizado, apesar de ocorrer todos os dias é feito de forma diferente a cada vez. As vezes a cama é arrumada outras não. As toalhas são trocadas mas as quantidades variam alguns dias e o chão não é limpo com a mesma frequência.
As instalações novas e o atendimento excelente são diferenciais muito positivos. Os quartos possuem uma cozinha bem completa, com utensílios, micro-ondas, geladeira e lava louças.
A equipe, principalmente a responsável pelo café da manhã, está de parabéns pelo atendimento.

It’s a safe area. 
I’m deducting a star because the room wasn’t filthy but could’ve been a bit cleaner. Room service is every other day so trash can pile up if you have kids (diapers). We had to take out our trash bag so the room wouldn’t smell. ",8,sirabel,2023-11-27

"Stayed during Thanksgiving week, two rooms, family of 6.
Pros: Hot breakfast every morning & menu changed daily. To-go breakfast sandwiches was nice touch! Staff is very friendly and helpful. Arrived early & luckily they were able to check us in early and honored our request for adjoining rooms. Rooms modern decor. Great storage to put clothes away/hang jackets. Table w wheels a nice touch to move around as needed. Queen bed comfy. Pull out couch/bed not so comfy. Small kitchen convenient esp mini fridge and microwave. Bathroom great. Hot water not a problem. Housekeeping came every other day to give fresh towels and empty trash. Lobby great. Nice dining area to sit and eat dinner or relax. Complimentary coffee/tea all day (thanks!). Location is awesome. Exit hotel and to your right is a short walk to a subway station and Rockefeller Center/Radio City Music Hall area. To your left is a short walk to Times Square and Broadway and tons of shopping and places to eat. Across the street is Little Italy for great pizza and quick service and also is a liquor store where we bought water/sodas/etc. Hotel is on a cross street along Thanksgiving Day parade route, convenient!

Cons: There are 5-6 elevators controlled by a panel where you pick your floor and then an elevator is assigned. Slow during busy times. Breakfast is super busy 7-10am. Go 6-7am and it's really nice. Room does have a constant sound from vent (like there's a vacuum running).

Would stay again. Thank you!",10,Glen,2023-11-25

"Location: 10e lode ( oltre ad essere su time square, per un pasto veloce la pizzeria di fronte vende tranci di pizza non male!); personale: 10; colazione: 10; pulizia: in teoria viene effettuata un giorno si ed un giorno no. È capitato che la nostra stanza fosse dimenticata e abbiamo chiesto alla reception che si è subito mossa per le pulizie. 
Le stanze con divano letto non possono ospitare 4 persone anche se due sono ragazzi over 10 anni ed infatti appena arrivati siamo stati messi in una stanza con doppio letto matrimoniale. Attenzione alla cauzione che poi viene restituita in 5 giorni lavorativi . ",8,Laura,2023-11-19

Ar condicionado barulhento e sem regulagem.
Localização excelente

"The property is in a great location. It is near time square and the Rockefeller Center/5th Avenue. My mom and I stayed for 3 nights and 4 days the front desk was very nice and friendly. One thing I feel may need improvement is the housekeeping, all 3 days we had to ask for someone to take out the trash and refresh our toiletries. I don’t agree with the concept of housekeeping every other day. As well as the a/c in our room was a bit noisy, it was a bit difficult to sleep. Besides those mishaps, It was an enjoyable stay. ",6,Zaylin,2023-11-18
A suite with a queen size bed.  Very quiet.  Small kitchenette with necessary equipment.  Refrigerator and microwave.  Shower was a little small but big enough to turn around.  Would have liked towels to be changed each day.  Good location for business.,8,Michael,2023-11-18
"The staff was always willing to help and the free breakfast was tasty and had a lot of choices! The elevators were a bit hard to figure out at first and sometimes you had to wait for them. But other than that, our room was updated and was a great size for the price. 

Our favorite part though? How easy it was to access the subway and the Times Square area! This hotel is an ideal location for folks looking to enjoy what the heart of NYC has to offer.",10,Kathleen,2023-11-17

"Não entendo a quantidade de comentários negativos. O hotel é super novo, muito bem localizado. Todo o staff é muito amigável e sempre disposto a ajudar.

O café da manhã é muito bom. Com tantos hotéis sem café em NY, eu nem me atreveria a reclamar.

O ar condicionado de fato faz barulho durante a noite, mas nada que nos incomodasse muito.


Tivemos de esperar apenas uma vez pelo elevador por alguns minutos. De resto, super rápido.

Dica: se você é brasileiro e pretende usar cartão da Nomad para fazer o pagamento da estadia, lembre que o hotel faz um bloqueio no cartão de 100 dólares por dia de hospedagem (algo bem comum entre hotéis) e depois da estadia o valor é devolvido. Então, para não ficar com dinheiro bloqueado, lembre de pagar apenas o valor da estadia no cartão da Nomad ou Wise e solicitar pra passar esse valor de hoje em outro cartão - usamos o de crédito normal e foi tudo certo.",10,Verified traveler,2023-11-17

"Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral, in einer Nebenstraße vom Times Square. Trotzdem ist die Lage relativ ruhig gelegen. Frühstück ist für ein 3 Sterne Hotel sehr gut, es gibt zudem rund um die Uhr Kaffee und Tee in der Lobby umsonst. Toll war die Regelung mit dem Fahrstuhl, man musste nicht ewig warten, gab sein Stockwerk in einem Display an und der Fahrstuhl fuhr zügig, ohne viele Zwischenhalte, in das gewünschte Stockwerk.
Das einzige Manko war die Klimaanlage, die sich nachts immer wieder von allein, mit einem hohem Lärmpegel, einschaltete. Auf Nachfragen soll das Problem beseitigt werden, das Hotel wurde gerade erst eröffnet und sie sind sich dessen bewusst, so dass an der Regelung gearbeitet wird.",8,Verified traveler,2023-11-13

"Honestly, the rooms and the property itself are good. However, there is one area that proved very irritating and that is the elevators. Waiting and waiting until you feel stranded on your floor, setting your plans back… it was exhausting and happened on several occasions during our 3 night stay. I can usually let stuff slide but it was a real whip. ",6,Fallon,2023-11-13
Check in was rough but I will say the workers were all very generous and kind! We got to check in half hour early and couldn’t check in early which was totally ok so we came back an hour later. When we got back we ended up waiting in line for an hour to check in and even when we got to the front desk finally our room wasn’t even ready yet. At this point it was over an hour past the check in time so I don’t know how the room wasn’t ready. This was a little irritating because we had places to be and ended up running late for our plans but the front desk was very accommodating and gave us complimentary snacks and drinks due to the extra wait. Other than the difficulty with check in the rooms were great and spacious as well as clean! Location was nice and convenient I feel like the price was a steal. I would stay here again but I would make sure I left extra time incase of a hard check in again ,8,Kaitlyn,2023-11-12

"Great new hotel right right in the center of Time Square. They were still working out a few kinks with the elevators and fire alarms and revolving doors, but the staff was so friendly, the views were great, the rooms were nice and quiet, and the location was perfect. We'd definitely stay here again.",10,Robert,2023-11-07
"Das Hotel ist neu und komfortabel. Die Zimmer bieten alles was man braucht. Leider ist die Lüftung und die Klimaanlage sehr laut und nicht abzuschalten (wer geräuschempfindlich ist sollte ohropax verwenden). Für 4 Personen ist das Zimmer zu klein, auch zu dritt ist es eher beengend. Das Frühstück war gut und die Mitarbeiter:innen freundlich. Das Zimmer wurde zwar gereinigt, aber nie gesaugt oder gewischt. Da das Hotel aber erst kürzlich eröffnet wurde muss hier wahrscheinlich erst noch eine Routine gefunden werden. Die Lage ist sehr gut, vorallem wenn man das erste Mal NYC besucht, super Ausgangslage und auch fussläufig kann man viel erreichen. Ansonsten ist man auch sehr rasch an verschiedenen Metro Stationen.",8,Nicole,2023-11-07

"Superbe séjour à New York. 
Nous avions réservé  à l’hôtel Homes2suites by Hilton, une chambre pour 4 personne avec petite cuisine et lit d’appoint. 
A notre arrivé, on nous explique que la chambre que nous avions réservé pour 4 personne (2 adultes et 2 enfants) se trouve trop petite pour ce groupe en effet on nous donne une chambre avec un lit seulement et ensuite une autre chambre avec un un lit et clic clac mais vraiment trop petit pour nos 2 enfants (11 ans et 15 ans ) 
On nous prend une caution de 700 euros et on nous explique que l’on va changer d’hôtel et nous mettre dans le Hampton Inn by Hilton qui se trouve dans le même bâtiment et non nous explique que l’on va nous prendre une deuxième caution pour cette nouvelle chambre. 
Nous avons donc refuser et négocier pendant de long moment pour que l’on aient pas de deuxième caution. 
Âpres tous ça on nous a donné une chambre avec 2 grand lit neuf et très bien équipé ( micro onde et frigo ) mais sans cuisine !!!!
On nous offre 3 boissons et 3 collation. 
Le séjour se passe très bien le petit déjeuner est copieux et bon, le service est très bien et le personnel est très courtois. 
Le ménage,  il faut demandé à ce qu’il soit fais car sinon il ne passe pas  tous les jours et de plus même quand il sont passés le sol n’a pas été fait ni aspirateur et lavage. 
L’emplacement est idéal en plein Times square  
Le Métro est juste à côté (Rockefeller )vous avez plein de choses pour sortir et se divertir ainsi que pour manger. 
",8,ouided,2023-11-02
L'hôtel est idéalement situé. Le petit-déjeuner est satisfaisant et appréciable. Le plus gros problème vient de la taille des chambres. Nous avions réservé un studio pour 4 personnes (2 adultes et 2 ados) impossible pour les enfants de dormir dans le canapé convertible qui est pour 1 seule personne et de très mauvaise qualité (matelas). On nous a changé de chambre sans difficultés mais la chambre avec 2 lits n'avait plus de cuisine. Il est également important de savoir que pour 8 nuits on nous a demandé une caution de 700 dollars qui est encaissée immédiatement et remboursée après le départ. ,8,Olivier,2023-11-01

"The only good think was the location in the city, the rest was terrible, we don’t had hot water 3 nights, and every time that I come to the front desk the manager just make me a bad face and said “already reported, wait for the engineer” also I need go to the front desk due the room don’t have phone.
We buy our own toilet paper and housekeeping never comes.
The noise, at list 3 false alarms at night, the air exhaust makes a lot noise no meter if the fan was on or not.
No wifi or network connection during 2 days.
The closet was just to decorate the room, not rack tube inside, we also request to the overnight manager and just say I will check it.
The night lamp was no bulb.",4,Sanchez Roldan,2023-10-31

"Hi, When I arrived at midnight to check in, my hotel room, the front desk informed me that my hotel room had been given away earlier that evening.  They were able to get me a room in the adjoining hotel.  I was told to head to the 8th floor with a very confusing elevator system that tells you which elevator to take, however, none of the elevators are marked with the same ""E6"" that it tells you to go to.  There are markings on the ground floor, on the top of the frame of the elevator, and no one at the front desk explains this to you. 
On the 8th floor there are no markings at all as to which elevator you're supposed to take (shrug emoji here). My room had most of the essential amenities, however, there was no closet to hang a jacket, the body wash dispenser in the shower was empty (and remained to for the length of the stay), the HVAC fan turns off and on every 30 mintues to make sure that you don't hit REM sleep, and on my last night stay there, there a false 3:15am fire alarm went off signaling the end of my stay.  The bed was comfortable, and the breakfast was fine. ",4,Sherri,2023-10-30

It’s a brand new property. There are times it’s quite a busy period especially in the morning due to the hotel breakfast. You have a number of properties hotel guests using 4 lifts. So be prepared to wait. Regardless we enjoyed our stay. I’ll definitely recommend visitors to stay. Very convenient and easily accessible to Times Square and Rockefeller Plaza!,10,Ana,2023-10-26

"Staff is very nice and hotel is new. The elevator consistently didn’t work or would take 25 mins. I also had to go up and down 6 times because my room key card did not work. The manager had to let me into my room with his master key and I was left keyless for the majority of my stay. It took about 2 hours to finally get into my room upon check in. They also overbooked so I ended up in a room that was a downgrade from what I paid for. Although the staff was polite and apologetic I’m incredibly shocked they did not offer any sort of refund or partial refund considering the room and situation I had to deal with. Oh, did I mention once I finally got into my room they had given my room to another group who was standing outside my door attempting to get in. I get that a new hotel can often have its challenges but the amount of challenges clearly demonstrates the hotel was not ready to open. Extremely disappointed and will never come back ",2,Arash,2023-10-26
