"I've stayed at an Aloft previously and found the facility to be superb. However upon checking in at this particular location I was a bit disappointed with the conditions of the hotel. Maybe it is just an older facility, but it appeared to be worn down. My room was located on the 5th foor and the carpet throughout the hallways was lifting away causing ripples that were a tripping hazard. 

I was also surprised by the new parking charges. The hotel charges $16/night to park in their lot, which I feel is outrageous considering this is NOT a downtown hotel with a parking garage. It is merely a suburb hotel with it's own parkin lot. This alone will deter me from staying at an Aloft in the future. 

The room was relatively clean, however the shower did leak through a gap in the door onto the bathroom floor.

The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. ",6,TaBetha,2025-09-17

"Really close to the airport with shuttle service and walked distance to restaurants.  You do have to pay to park, I paid $17 to park one night. No breakfast included but they have coffee and tea in the room. Clean room and comfy beds.",8,Karla,2025-09-04
"Always one of my favorite places to stay. Check in was an easy, rooms are always comfortable and great for short stays. ",10,Jenna,2025-08-28
The beds were not comfortable for my liking. They moved a lot from the bed frame. My room was located near the hotel entrance and unfortunately had some very loud people having a conversation at 2:00 in the morning.  ,4,Alejandra,2025-08-26

"Our stay was average overall, but the parking situation was really disappointing. We had to pay for parking, yet when we returned later that night, the lot was completely full and we had nowhere to park. This really took away from the convenience of our stay.",6,Walter,2025-08-01

"Our stay was pleasant. At check-in we couldn't find anyone around the front desk or a sign or way to get ahold of anyone. When someone showed up he was very friendly and helpful. Check-in was seamless. The room itself was average, just don't look too closely. It was surface clean, but needed a good deep clean. Our shuttle to and from the airport were great too.",8,Tessa,2025-07-27

"An unexpected layover in Denver introduced us to the Aloft. Our room was clean and spacious. We liked the ability to temperature control the room. 

We noted that there was laundry and a pool on site, but did not use them. The lobby is modern and spacious. 

The on-site shop has limited food and beverage options. However, there is a Starbucks and full-service restaurant and bar at the Marriott across the road. We got a lovely cooked breakfast and lattes for take out from there.

We particularly appreciated bring able to sign up for the free airport shuttle, which was running every 30 minutes during the day.",10,Erika,2025-07-06

"1)WiFi wouldn’t connect
2)We have to come down if we need towels. Inconvenient for mother of infants or families. 
3)Long wait time probably due to short staff
4)One front desk person.
5)Extra Charge for parking $16
6) no ice machine on floor

I wouldn’t stay again or recommend. Sorry

Positive is tv had Netflix and other tv networks with good movie and show options.

"I have stayed at a number of Aloft properties and have always had good experiences.  This stay was an exception to that history.
The room smelled of mold/mildew, to the point of causing my nose to feel stuffy overnight.
There were numerous moths in the room that loved the light from the TV and bathroom vanity.
The mattress was on a wood platform which cause it to slide around with the slightest movement.  
The mini fridge didn't work, so I had to throw out some perishable items I placed in there.
I had a very early flight and could not get the shower to warm at all...even after running it on full hot for 15 minutes (waste of water).  It finally warmed to tepid just as I was ready to get out.
I was going to share a few of these concerns with the clerk when I checked out, but she really didn't seem to want to be there let alone listen to my concerns.",2,William,2024-10-07
Staff was exceptional. Hotel was in a very nice area and the room was very clean. ,10,Shelby,2024-10-07
"I love that the property is so quiet, I love the ambient lighting in the rooms, and I love Drybar so I love that the products are in the room. However, when I called for an airport pickup, the woman kept placing me on hold, and then finally disconnected the call. I tried calling back multiple times and kept getting the voicemail. I left a message and still, no one has even returned my call. When I got to the hotel, the woman was full of sarcastic remarks. Her voice is very low and soft and it was a struggle to hear her, and the overhead music was loud. She would have a rude comment to say when I would try to get her to repeat herself and I felt it was uncalled for. I was extremely exhausted and I hadn’t slept since the day before. I doubt anyone will do anything, but it was upsetting to be treated this way, especially as a paying customer. I don’t demand any special treatments, but I hope to be treated with basic decency, which this woman did not give me. She made my already tiring day more of a hassle with just her attitude and her draining presence. ",4,Jarin,2024-10-07
"Being my first time at this hotel in this location, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed my stay. The room was incredibly comfortable. The pictures don’t do it justice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again. ",10,Cheryl Ann,2024-10-05
"Standard business class hotel starting to show its age around the edges.  Great TV package, but breakfast was not really a thing— just coffee and a very few bagged ""snacks"" not even comparable to bad motel ""Continental Breakfast"".",6,Tina,2024-10-03

"It was okay for most part. Second night of stay the fire alarm went off at 5am and front desk said it was a “fire drill”. Not necessarily a great time for a “fire drill” as we are trying to get rest. Room service never refilled the room with soap , conditioner or shampoo. Service could have been a little better. Other than things mentioned, stay was decent.",6,joel,2024-09-30
"Convenient location close to airport. Plenty of dining options within walking distance. Staff was friendly. There was a fire alarm one morning at around 5 am. No one even explained the cause or directed guests what to do once it was cleared to re-enter the hotel. 
Room was comfortable. However there was a large brown stain on one of the mattresses that was a little disturbing   Also the tile in the bathroom/shower area could use.a deep clean and the bathroom door could use some paint. 
Overall it was ok for a quick stay close to the airport.  ",6,Mandi,2024-09-29

"We travel with our fur babies and we stayed in an aloft in Orlando and thought this could be our new home on the road.  Wrong,  

Our second experience will likely be our last as the standard of property and service are so radically different,

Our check in was abysmal, took 10 minutes and I was the only one there and I checked in online.  Awful, they were not cordial or jovial, lazy and preoccupied.  

I will not go into the small problems with the room and hotel, just sad that Aloft was not the pet travelers paradise we thought it would be.  ",4,Cody,2024-07-27

"CHECK YOUR RECEIPT! We stayed at this property for less than 12 hours and they charged us for 3 days of parking. We arrived at 6PM and left at 3:15AM to catch our flight and as we were leaving I noticed my folio in my email. I saw that they charged me for 3 days of parking, so when we left I went to talk to the front desk - no one was there so I left a note asking them to remove the Extra charges and it’s been over a week and they still haven’t removed the charges or communicated with me. 
The hotel room we stayed in was really run down, cracks in the walls and cabinet for the safe, scratches in the paint, and the carpets and decor felt really worn and outdated. It’s close to the airport, that’s about the only positive.",4,Maria,2023-07-30

"This is a great property! Swanky and modern. Lots of room to hang out in the lobby. Easy to get to and from the airport and always someone to assist you. Rooms are set up very well for a family traveling together. Lots of space for our stuff, interesting yet perfect closet set up. The room has everything you need even though it is sleek and everything is built in.",10,Verified traveler,2023-03-20

"They invaded my privacy. Cleaning was done already, didn’t ask for any room service still they went to my room when I was out for the day. ",4,Mostafizur,2023-03-08

"The Aloft is basically a more modern Holiday Inn.  It's just the basics, no flash or pomp.  Decent facility, airport area with limited restaurant/walking options.  Good transportation to the airport, but don't expect anything more.  The front desk associate was not inclined to send the shuttle to pick me up at the train station across the highway, so I had to walk a mile with my luggage.  

Decent stay.  Basics, no frills.  Close to airport and train station.",6,James,2023-01-26

I can’t believe in this day and age there are NO usb plugs anywhere in this hotel. No available adapters and no help from the staff. ,4,Caryn,2023-01-09
