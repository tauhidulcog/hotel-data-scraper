Staff was very helpful welcoming! It also is a short convenient walk to queens plaza station which can take you to both jfk airport and Manhattan.,10,jake,2025-09-24
Nice property. Food we at at the bar and drinks were good. Breakfast in the morning was also good. Only thing we didn't like was they only had one working elevator. There also was an issue with the electricity on our room. The iron kept shutting off and on while trying to iron our outfits for a party we were going to and the door key card system kept making weird noises through the night probably due to the electricity issue. But whats weird is it didn't affect the TV or the lights. But the outlets by the bed affected our phones charging.,10,Christopher,2025-09-23

"This hotel is conveniently located right across from the city, and there is a parking garage right next door.
While booking there was an option for city view which I was told upon checking in isn’t available because there is a high rise next door. Also, room wasn’t thoroughly cleaned, I saw what appeared to be someone boogers on pillows. Also, outdated desk chair with a broken cracked arm rest.",6,AYESHAH,2025-09-22

"For NYC this was a good option when Manhattan was completely unaffordable. The location is good - steps to the subway which takes you into midtown in one or two stops. There is very limited parking but there's a parking garage literally next door -- it's not cheap, but ok. Queens is edgy, but that's ok as long as you have your wits about you.
I had an issue with the room which was on the 2nd floor, tiny and right next to the elevator, despite me requesting to be away from the elevator when I booked. I was told the specific type of room I asked for was only in this location - but not until I came to check in, by which time I didn't have any option. The elevator always took ages to arrive so we mostly used the stairs and went out of the emergency exit, but when we came to check out the elevator was broken and we had heavy luggage. Pretty annoying when the noise of it had kept me awake during the night.
Overall, it is what it is - ok for a short stay but far from luxurious and I advise you to check about room location before booking.",6,Samantha,2025-09-07

"I didn't realize that Long Island city was in the heart of the city, but I knew that I could park my car safely at the hotel garage, it was not the case at all.
The hotel uses Champions parking which i a public parking next door who favors the guests from the Marriott courtyard next. I attended to park twice and was refused entry because I was staying at the Hilton Garden, I finally had to go park at another parking 3 blocks away and walked luggage on hand. The clerk was very casual about it, he said "" Expedia misled you because we don't provide parking for any of our guests, they have to use public parking "" I will never stay there again. The bathroom was horrible only one side door for the shower, I almost fell twice walking on the wet floor after a shower. I stayed in Room 711 very small the TV is in front of the bathroom, fridge, microwave and desk in the same spot behind the bathroom door. Totally disgusting.

"It was a nice hotel with a great location, but it was let down by dated amenities showing significant wear. The ironing board got stuck and wouldn’t collapse, the toilet took about 20 minutes to refill before it could be flushed again, and the shower gel dispenser stopped working. I removed it from the wall and left it on the counter for morning service, but it was still there later, which was a little disappointing. The hotel breakfast was average. I would stay here again if the price was good, but I wouldn’t overpay considering what you get.",8,Oliver,2025-08-10

"I paid extra for parking in the garage and when I went to retrieve some sort of parking pass, the receptionist proceeded to deny that parking was ever existing at this location, which was really strange because booking with Expedia they allowed me to pay additionally for plan for a protection on the booking, in addition to parking on site, I feel like things could’ve been handled a lot better but clearly customer service was not their strength and work ethic while the hotel experience overall was fair. I think it matters how people speak with you and the impression that they leave you so ultimately that conversation ultimately lead to all over score. ",4,Diane,2025-07-21

"Excelente localizacion del hotel, a 15 minutos en metro de la estacion Gran Central, durante las inundaciones de NY las líneas de metro cercanas al hotel no se inundaron como otras lineas del metro de la ciudad. El único problema es que el aseo de la habitación no es diario, solicitamos al hotel lo hicieran diario y no obstante nos dijeron que lo harian en los hechos nunca paso. Recomendamos ampliamente el hotel que incluyan desayunos.

The hotel's excellent location, a 15-minute subway ride from Grand Central Station. During the NYC floods, the subway lines near the hotel weren't flooded like other subway lines in the city. The only problem is that the room isn't cleaned daily. We asked the hotel to do it daily, but they told us they would, but it never happened. We highly recommend the hotel for including breakfast.",10,Miguel Angel,2025-07-21

Shame there was no view and we had a room next to the lift shaft so could hear that clanking away. Air con was very noisy so we couldn’t keep it on while we slept. The location of the hotel makes up for these negatives though and we would  stay there again. ",8,Natalie,2025-05-18

The price was comparable to other garages around the area. We did not dine or use any of the other services. The beds were clean and comfortable.

"This was a short stay.

The hotel is in a prime location of queen, LIC (Long Island city) nestled right at the bridge to head into manhattan. 

The hotel room itself is small, bed is comfortable, TV is big (with all cable), shower is hot and water pressure is good. 

The walls are extremely thin, you can hear everything, and all the doors slam pretty loudly, so this is heard very clearly.

Upon arrival I wasn’t even greated with a warm friendly greeting. I was grilled by the man at the front desk. I gave him my name then he kept going on and on about not smoking in the hotel and how strict they are about smoking marijuana and I don’t smoke!  He then proceeded to ask for my id and check me in. I gave him my card for the room and I swiped it and paid! He then asked to see my card again so I physically handed it to him he held my card up to the ceiling as if he was looking for something. Then crossed checked my card with the card I booked online with then told me it’s two different cards as if a person can only have one card lol. I explained to him that it’s my other card and why does it matter I just paid everything in full! He gave me my key card and sent me on my way I felt very discriminated against I felt uncomfortable walking through the hotel or even staying at the hotel. I got electrocuted from the plug falling out the wall my charger was plugged up too! And there was hair in the shower!  ,2,Cierra,2025-03-17

Everything was clean but our room was right under the buildings boiler and between the elevator and exist stairs. You can hear every single ding and bang nonstop.

"The hotel is in a highly convenient location—just a 2–5 minute walk from several major subway lines, making it easy to reach Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, or JFK. While not the quietest spot, that’s expected given the central location.

A buffet breakfast is available (though I didn’t try it), and it seemed popular with other guests. There are a few cafes nearby, but dining options generally require a subway ride—not necessarily an issue. The hotel also has an Amazon locker in the basement, which is a nice convenience.

Maintenance could be improved; my room had a broken light switch, a faulty bedside lamp, and a very loose faucet. That said, the room was clean and equipped with useful amenities like a small refrigerator and microwave.

Check-in was smooth, and the service was good.

Outro ponto aconteceu com relação ao sabonete do banho. Acabou, pedi mais na recepção, o atendente falou que não tinha e me sugeriu ir a uma farmácia 24 horas tarde noite comprar com o meu dinheiro..

"So close to the Subway station, which was very nice given the cold weather. There is a convenience store/deli just steps away that had really good food. The room was comfortable, just a bit small (as expected for NYC). The employees were all very friendly and helpful.
There were issues with the heat in the lobby area which made it almost unbearable to have a drink at the bar, or sit and eat breakfast. It seemed that it was normal until one day it was actually working and employee mentioned it had been fixed. The breakfast buffet was mediocre most days. It would be nice to have little things like shredded cheese for the eggs, and a pancake or waffle option every day. ",8,Christine,2024-12-30

"Tive uma experiência ruim, fiz uma reserva para dois dias e para 4 pessoas, tivemos a surpresa de chegar no quarto e só ter duas toalhas, fizemos a solicitação de mais duas toalhas porém a recepcionista (bem mal educada) falou para aguardar por 1h que a camareira estava em horário de refeição. Após 1h e nada das toalhas, fomos até a recepção e novamente a recepcionista disse que a camareira não havia voltado, porém uma segunda recepcionista foi até o deposto e pegou as duas toalhas. No dia seguinte, para nossa surpresa, levaram duas toalhas e deixaram somente duas, novamente pedimos e explicamos que estávamos em 4 pessoas e novamente a mesma recepcionais disse para aguardar o break da camareira. Por fim, levaram as outras duas toalhas após 30min. Experiência ruim pelo preço cobrado em alta temporada.

Like last time, there was a regular thumping through the night caused by the building systems I assume. Also rude guests talking in the hallway and letting their doors slam 6:30 - 7:30 AM. Dog barking for 2 hours (!). Last two are not the hotel’s fault but should be known.",8,Susan,2024-09-06

"This place is a joke! It feels like a different planet, broken down elevators and people getting stuck in them. Having to wait almost an hour just to get up to your room or down to the lobby due to one elevator working for the entire place including staff. Check your bill because they over charge you and good luck trying to get a hold of someone to get that money back I’m still trying to get a hold of any staff member to correct the charge. Rooms are outdated and filthy, I asked to be moved from the first room that I was given because there was blood on the headboard, food crumbs on the desk and chair. Linens and pillows smell like sweat and extremely disgusting. The sheets are pasty cream color and there is an odor to the room. Dust balls on the wall, I was incredibly congested due to the amount of dust on the wall. The vent is visibly dirty with black and gray dust on them. So we’re just breathing all that in. Run for the hills from that place. The Marriott next door is a bliss! ",2,Ola,2024-07-07

"The overall stay was okay. It’s a convenient location with nearby grocery stores and easy to get to multiple subway lines. However, the housekeeping of the hotel was a disaster. Despite there’s a sign on the bathroom mirror indicating housekeeping is every other day, no one came and cleaned the room for a straight four-days. I even called front desk on both the third and forth day for multiple times requesting for housekeeping, still nothing was done. On the last day of the stay, I saw a live cockroach crawling on the wall in my room and I killed it, which concerned me even more about the hygiene of this hotel. Housekeeping is really basic but important for any hotels. I hope the management of Hilton group will indeed pay attention to this issue for Hilton Garden Inn in Long Island City and bring us as customers a nicer experience in the future. Thanks!

"I made a reservation and paid for it for the night of 12/24 since I was told I had to have a reservation to have any rights provided me. I thus went online and found out they were lying to me all along about not having availability for the night of the 24th. I was then, in violation of the ADA, summarily removed from the property with an injured back and a recent Neuronal (epileptic type seizure due to prior lack of sleep and stress) by a corrupt-appearing pair of NYPD cops. I was shocked that I kept getting updates from you and expedia as if my paid reservation for $177 was never cancelled. And then my bank info showed the paid reservation for the $ 177 was put through twice, for a total rip off of $344. You and expedia now show me as having checked out on 12/25 as if I actually stayed at this very backwards place. I need the $344 back from you or expedia immediately, as it is needed for the French and european portion of my trip.

"Convenient area, close to subway stations. Hotel’s  common areas are well maintained. My room didn’t have enough towels and even asking the front desk, they were not provided. Bed covers were dated and they were not clean. Room was not vacuumed. Bed was comfortable. ",6,Rafael,2023-12-03

"This property cannot be easily reached by phone. I called the 800 number which then had to call the real hotel. We wanted two adjoining rooms. I asked the central hotel line and asked them to put a note in the system. When we got there, there was no early check in. The rooms weren’t ready until close to 5 and we didn’t get our second room until around 6. They said it was because we booked through Expedia, they didn’t get any notes in advance that we wanted adjoining rooms. I thought if you didn’t put the tag on the door that they would clean your room. We had to request every day to change towels and take out trash. They didn’t clean the room at all while we stayed 4 days. The iron didn’t work, requested another one and that didn’t work. Also, this hotel hosts a lot of pilots and crew personnel so they are the priority. One thing I can say is that the hotel was clean. No complaints there. ",6,Ayo A.,2023-08-12
"Gute Anbindung, Subway ist in drei Minuten zu erreichen. Supermarkt ist ebenfalls in der Nähe. Freundliches Personal und ein für amerikanische Verhältnisse gutes Frühstück. Betten waren gut. Wir haben uns für die 8 Nächte dort sehr wohlgefühlt.",10,Patrick,2023-08-12
"I found my stay quite disappointing. First we paid $38 per day for parking, but when we arrived we were told there was no parking, but we still paid $38 for parking, like what!! 

Second, the photos of the rooms shown on the website look much larger, but in reality ours was really small, even for a 3 person room, it looked like it was a room for 1 or 2 people max. We were very tight, there was no room to move.

Third, the sofa bed was very uncomfortable as the mattress was very thin so it hurt and there was a stain on the white sheet. The sofa bed completely sticks to the desk when open, impractical and the furniture looks like it's been there for ages.

For service I would say there was only one person who was really willing to help us, he was friendly and he attended to our needs, but otherwise that's it.

So overall I thought it was poor for what we spent at this hotel. I do not recommend it, very disappointed.

"I didn't like how the person at the front desk helped the airline staff before me, even though I was waiting on line.  I am a paying customer just like everyone else, and I didn't appreciate that.  Also after a long night the keys weren't working for our room doors, there was a lot of back and forth up and down on the elevator trying to get into our room.  Also, the kitchen staff gave me a hard time about taking my breakfast up to my room.  My sister is disabled and I had to bring the food to her upstairs and the waitress was giving me a hard time about using 1 of the trays to carry my items.  Overall not a good experience.",4,KATHRYN,2023-07-24

"I live in Jersey and didn’t want to drive home after hanging out in the city for the night so I booked a room here. I had the worst sleep of my life and my husband expressed the same. The walls are super thin so every noise from the hall woke me up; and the other guests weren’t being intentionally loud. I was also charged for a king room and received a queen. Hotels.com remedied that so I can’t complain. This just isn’t a property I would book again when there are more comfortable, larger and comparable properties in the immediate area.
