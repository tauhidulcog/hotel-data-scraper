We booked 2 bedrooms but when we arrived told no more available and we would be given two separate rooms but comped for second. The cost was the same and it was very inconvenient to go back and forth to just pay the same price. A one bedroom is not the same price. We weren‚Äôt comped anything. ,6,Christina,2025-10-06
"Enjoyed our stay. Friendly staff, comfy accommodations. Could have been a bit on the cleaner and tidy side. Not too big a big deal, but for the price we paid for one night, I expected a spic and span room.",10,Ita,2025-10-06
"The pressure of the water of the bathroom was really low. And when i tried to put on a high pressure, it would just get really hot. Also, when we first got on the shower there was a lot of hair on the tub. The rest of the room was fine. Pretty clean on other areas expect for the tub. ",6,Matheus,2025-10-06

"Great hospitality and customer service from the staff. We enjoyed our upgraded suite, which was a pleasant surprise for me and my daughter‚Äôs road trip and Tate McRae concert!  They made my daughter feel like a complete rockstar and made her trip a memorable experience! Great location, 3 minute uber drive, and beautiful hotel!",10,Ashlee,2025-09-22

We check in 9/18 in room 913 he room and that whole tail end of the corridor was beyond just hot even though the rest of the hotel was cool. I contacted the front desk they said they would send maintenance. Nothing was fixed but they told us it was. The thermostat said 60 degrees the room was well into the 70s even at night. Night two same thing we finally ask for fans because they offered no alternatives than let us continue to stay in the worst room ever uncomfortable as ever 0/10. ,2,Natasha,2025-09-21

A wonderful staff and good complimentary breakfast. We stayed in the two bedroom suite and were surprised that the shared bathroom access was via the smaller second bedroom. Which can be a bit of a tricky situation when nature calls and you have to interrupt the other individual to use the facilities. I am wondering if this was a one off or if all the suites have the same layout? ,8,Christopher,2025-09-15

The staff was AMAZING!!! THE BEST EVER!!! I was there 4 days & the outside doors did not work with the key access. I was there for work got in super late & my room was by the side door the area to smoke. I had to walk all thw way around to the front door as a i passed 2 doors thayvwould not open with my key card. It sounded like the employees knew & it just is not getting fixed. ,10,Melissa,2025-09-03

"We were not impressed with our stay. The location itself did not feel inviting at all, and the surrounding area looked very run-down. On top of that, we were charged $17 per night for parking, which I find ridiculous considering we already spent about $300 for two nights. At that rate, parking should be included.

They also don‚Äôt offer free Wi-Fi. Instead, you have to sign up for access, which is very inconvenient.

Our room was just okay. The shower definitely needs an upgrade, as everything felt old and outdated. There was also an unpleasant ‚Äúold apartment‚Äù smell throughout, and the commode was in terrible condition.

The only positive I can mention is their breakfast, it was the best part of our stay. Unfortunately, that alone is not enough for us to want to return.",6,Joseph,2025-09-02

The bath tub was outdated with yellow streak stain doen the middle and cracks that had been filled in. To charge for parking I feel is terrible. I told the fabulous staff member that this is what moves people to VRBOS. She took away the charge but 17$ a night for an open parking lot?? Disappointing. Staff everywhere were excellent.

"Everything was great but the mattress on the bed was so hard we both woke up in pain. It was a queen sized bed. I don‚Äôt recall it being like that when we stayed here before, so hopefully it is an isolated incident. We love the breakfast and the size of the rooms! ",8,Heather,2025-08-25

"On the first night, there was a big group of guests having a party with alcohol at the tables near the lobby since 4pm. The party kept on going until 3am some idiot activated the fire alarm. Everybody had to get out of bed and out of the hotel. It took almost 30 minutes for the people in charge to stop the alarm. I dont know if the hotel lets you drink alcohol out of your room but they just did whatever they wanted. ",6,Alberto,2025-08-14

"The room was nice and clean. Breakfast and Happy Hour were really good. The staff was professional and friendly. However, the building needs some upgrades. There was only 2/4 working elevators for 10 floors so the waits were long at times. There was also no hot water one of the days we were there. Housekeeping also did not do a great job of restocking things such as towels, toilet paper, coffee cups/items. We had to ask for something daily. ",8,Tiffany Hackett,2025-07-26
"I came to spend a week w/ my sister. The embassy was good, nothing special. The location was fair, near the expressway. The staffs excellent, friendly & helpful.

"Our experience as a family on 7-17-25 with ""Embassy Suites by Hilton Austin Central"" was terrible, DO NOT GO THERE. The bedding is old, the furniture is ancient and worn out, the bathroom is tiny, and the swimming pool they advertised is not in service. I requested a cancellation and refund of this reservation, and the current manager declined it. We moved to another hotel nearby for the same price with an amazing difference and excellent service. What a nightmare we had with this hotel, especially considering it's a Hilton.",2,RODOLFO,2025-07-21

A charge for parking of $17.00 in an unpaved lot with no notice before checkin?  Unheard of - I have never had to pay for parking ever in any hotel in my life.  There are snotty slime dripping out of the bath faucet.  Happy hour with goldfish and chex mix for snacks.  No shower cap in a shower only room.  The bed was the only thing I felt like touching with clean white sheets.  Hotels need a serious overall or even better a tear down.,4,Sharon,2025-07-17
"This property is fine. I don‚Äôt have any real complaints. My only concern was it said each room had a balcony. The balcony is not a traditional outside balcony. It‚Äôs the indoor balcony that the embassy is known for. My balcony happen to be facing a wall, which I didn‚Äôt care for.",8,Delosha,2025-07-17

"It could have been a really nice hotel if it had proper upkeep. It seemed pretty rundown.
Obvious repair work that was never painted over in the shower ceiling, bathroom faucet leaking. I found a fingernail (or toenail, idk) on the couch. There were no trash bags in any of the bins. There was no conditioner in the eco friendly refillable bottle in the shower. It seemed like a slap in the face to have a sign next to the bed encouraging people to tip their housekeeper. 
The bed was okay, not as soft as other hotel beds I‚Äôve tried but still okay. It was a king bed and we were given standard size pillows but that‚Äôs the least of the problems here. 
Staff was very friendly. ",4,Verified traveler,2025-07-04

"This was our second time staying at this particular hotel within a 4 to 5 month time span.  Our first visit was pretty great.  I even left a review (back then) refelecting that. Because of our first great experience, we chose to book another Embassy Suites in Dallas, two months later, when we had an family event there.  The Embassy Suites in Dallas was not as great.  It had elevator problems.  The room was lack luster and semi clean and the parking was horrible, not to mention noisy (as refelected in that review).  But we did not judge the Austin location off of the Dallas location, as our first visit in the Austin location was pretty good.  So we found our selves back in Austin and chose to re-book that Embassy suites location based on our first experience.  But it was not the same.  The pool was closed the entire three days we were there.  Only one of the four elevators were operational duirng our three day stay.  And parking now cost $17 a day, as opposed to free parking 5 months ago at the same location.  Because of this, I am now looking for another Hotel chain to frequent on our trips away from home.",4,Jonathan,2025-06-02

"First off, the price that was stated wasn‚Äôt honored because they said they couldn‚Äôt find the reservation. Then, the drain in the tub didn‚Äôt work. Third, the shower heads didn‚Äôt work properly. Fourth, the pillows sucked and the bed was very hard.  ",4,RANDEL,2025-05-30

I reserved 2 queens, they tried to give me a one bed room.  Upon calling the front desk, she told me they didnt have any others however when I came down to visit with her on my way out to retreive my luggage, she did locate another room. That was the only hiccup and they did correct it, which I was thankful for.",8,Verified traveler,2025-05-26

"Incr√≠vel! As fotos do site s√£o exatamente o que o h√≥spede vai encontrar no local. As surpresas ficam por conta de uma pia extra no quatro, para maquiagem, escova de cabelos ou para a higine b√°sica de um dos h√≥spedes, que nos permite ganhar tempo; e do fato de que o banheiro, propriamente, dito √© pequeno. Parece que n√£o contavam com a porta. LOL. Ela d√° bem no meio do vaso sanit√°rio. Mas n√£o √© nada que cause desconforto. √â apenas estranho que o quarto seja excepcionalmente grande e a sala seja t√£o confort√°vel e o banheiro seja desproprocionalmente pequeno. De qualquer modo, o hotel √© nota 10. Tudo novo e arrumado. O v√£o central √© muito aconchegante e d√° aos h√≥spedes a impress√£o de estarem numa grande vila vertical. As piscinas s√£o muito boas! Uma delas √© grande e tem a temperatura ambiente. A outra √© tipo uma jacuzzi aquecida. O caf√© da manh√£ √© maravilhoso e dou a melhor nota para o gentil atendente do servi√ßo a la carte de ovos . O bar √© bom e, no happy hour, serve drinks gr√°tis. A prop√≥sito, os atendentes s√£o atenciosos e o card√°pio do restaurante √© bastante adequeado. Mas a ESTRELA SOLIT√ÅRIA do lugar fica por conta da gerente Jhean, que todos os dias, passa de mesa em mesa pela manh√£, cumprimentando os h√≥spedes e questionando sobre o atendimento de suas necessidades e expectativas, dando dicas de uma programa√ß√£o personalizada e cuidando da organiza√ß√£o do servi√ßo. Procurem por ela! Ela √© a chave e d√° personalidade ao lugar. Fui e voltarei! ",8,Clarisse,2025-05-18

"This Embassy Suites is not what I‚Äôm used to from this brand. The facilities at this property is rundown, elevators not working. Toilet water pressure is really low (toilet bowl itself was stained really bad) the room was old and tired, needs a total facelift. 
There was no shampoo in the dispenser and when I inquired at the front desk, I was  told that the staff had gone for the day and that I would need to contact them at 7am the following day. Additionally, the shower/tub caulking was molded, the bathtub stained.
I tired sleeping on the bed and it was so old and soft that it sloped to one side. 

Only positive was the breakfast and made to order omelets and buffet.

I really wouldn‚Äôt pay the high rate to stay at this embassy suites, if I‚Äôm getting a ‚Äútwo star‚Äù type of facility. Would opt to stay at a Double Tree Hotel or actual Hilton down the street. Save your money and stay at a newer property to get the money‚Äôs worth.

We had to talk to the manager about the lack of meat on our entree, but he fixed the problem quickly. The breakfast was great! The hotel does have a nice workout room and pool area. Cleaning crew should clean out the elevator threshold- full of candy. heads-up, you will have to pay for parking at this site.

I ended up leaving and booking a room at another hotel. I did NOT ask for a refund; I wasnt comfortable at the hotel and didn't want to make a deal about the refund.

"If I could give this hotel zero stars, I would. We booked a 2-bedroom suite for our family of six, expecting a comfortable and clean stay. Instead, we were placed in a room with severe water damage, a massive hole in the wall, and what appeared to be mold growing on the walls. It was absolutely disgusting and completely unacceptable for any hotel to offer a room in this condition.

When we reported the issue and requested to be moved, the only option they gave us was a basic room with two twin beds‚Äîfor six people! This was beyond unreasonable, and to make matters worse, finding another hotel wasn‚Äôt an option. We specifically booked a 2-bedroom suite, and with the NASCAR races happening that weekend, any last-minute availability at another hotel was nearly impossible. The hotel staff showed zero effort in making things right, leaving us stuck in an unsafe and unsuitable situation.

I am unable to post pictures directly to this review, but I would be happy to send them to any upper management or owner who would like to see the unacceptable conditions we were forced to deal with.

This hotel clearly does not prioritize guest safety or satisfaction. If you value cleanliness, comfort, and basic human decency, stay somewhere else!",2,chester,2025-03-03

"First off. I've been partial to this Embassy Suites as I have stayed here numerous times in the last 15 years. We are Hilton Honor members and this is one of my first places to look each time I come to Austin.

Communication could have been better. Every traveler/family checking in had no idea that the property was down to ONE elevator for the entire place. Highly inconvenient, but I do realize they were at the mercy of parts/service. 

Upon checking in, we went to our room only to find that the sheets on the bed were 'soiled' or whatever it was. The bathroom vent fan would not turn off. They did move us next door to a cleaner room. After that, the stay was fine.

HOWEVER...I left my Apple watch behind (totally on me). I have called almost daily for 3-4 days and requested a call back from Housekeeping and the property manager. Neither has happened. According to the front desk, not one person on site can walk to Housekeeping and look for the watch. It has become a loop that I can not get out of. 

Unfortunately, this property will be crossed off my list for further stays.",4,Kristy,2024-11-29

The staff did provided us with clean linen but it did leave us with the question of the overall cleanliness of the room, Besides that hiccup the rest of the stay was what we‚Äôve come to expect from Embassy: a safe and comfortable stay.",8,Marcella,2024-11-16
"This was my first stay at any embassy suite property.  I really liked the open atrium construction, which let in a lot of light.  The room was very spacious and comfy.  Breakfast options were great- fresh omelette, bacon, bagels, and coffee were all tasty.  Will choose embassy suites again in the future.",10,James,2024-11-15

"So, over all good. Breakfast was solid and above average. The free drinkz where a nice touch. The rooms where a tad weird, people could just see into your rooms unless the curtains where drawn shut but it was hard to close them otw out so people could just see into your room when not there. The pull out couch was so uncomfortable, and the king bed was also not up to par so we left late at night on our last night there. Staff is super nice and friendly. ",8,Hayden,2024-11-05

The lobby and hallways smelled very strong of chlorine, but I didn't see where the pool was. The room felt very damp and didn't smell good (I'd rather it smell like nothing). It's like there was a big wet spot in the floor so the humidity was too high and it wasn't comfortable when we tried to get some rest. The a/c was struggling to keep up at 71.

The first room was so hot, sinks were dirty and toilet didn‚Äôt flush. 2nd room was better and they had to put in a fan to help cool the room. Shower had mold on the tiles. Room service never came in 5 days to even make the beds. Trash was never taken out either. The pool water wasn‚Äôt clear, it was cloudy and salty, the hot tub bubbles didn‚Äôt work. One restroom soap dispenser didn‚Äôt work, I had to go to the other one to wash my hands properly. Snacks during happy hour were gone quickly and were 2nd rate. Cut up tomatoes not even cherry tomatoes. We went to breakfast once in 5 days and no more. The man making the omelette was so rude. They asked for his name to submit a tip and his response was ‚Äúnone-ya‚Äù dude they‚Äôre trying to tip you and he was so rude. I should have gone to a motel 6 instead and saved a lot of money. No supervision at all, kids going up and down the elevators running around each floor like a playground. Just absolutely awful, no staff was seen at all.  I would not recommend this hotel at all. I would expect this from a one star motel and not an embassy suites. We ended up leaving because we were so done. ",2,Sandra,2024-07-22

Our suite was spacious, love the extra sink in the bedroom & kitchen. Parking one time fee was practical. Except we experienced a power failure on one night that lasted of probably 2-3 hours and it was a summer hot night that my husband asked at the front desk for a portable electric fan. It was a crowded & busy weekend! Lots of guests  came in! That‚Äôs understandable. But in the future, please give all the guests a heads up if this will occur again, we are a bit panic and worried if the elevator will fail as well and trying to find where the exit stairs.

"I have been staying at this property for over 20 years...since I was a little girl. We used to host our family reunions here also. It's definitely not the hotel I remember. I was initially excited about the renovations but it seems as though the money for this was mostly put into the lobby first floor area. The rooms still show signs of wear and tear just covered with a coat of paint. The staff is extremely unenthusiastic. Lastly, they are charging for parking now. This isn't valet or a parking garage. There is an entire parking lot available and as of a year ago, I was told by staff...it is now $14 per stay. I don't understand this. It does not even feel like a Hilton anymore. 

The lobby is really nice and spacious and the rooms are okay. I would probably still stay here again. ",6,Ashley,2024-06-14

We love our Embassy stays for the most part but this was our first time in Austin and our stay was awful - A/C didn‚Äôt work so our room was hot very uncomfortable- bed was uncomfortable but that might have been due to the heat in our room. So unlike the Embassy ,4,David Lisa,2024-06-10
"The room would not stay below 78 degrees. The staff came up and ‚Äúfixed‚Äù the problem by placing 3 box fans in our room, which dropped the temp to 77. It was misserably warm. The offered to move us, but made us walk all over the hotel to pick up keys, find the room. It was terrible. It finally cooled down around 2am. They told us they had no manager on duty that could help. In the morning, the staff member told me because I booked on a third party website that is why we had such a bad experience. So, basically they don‚Äôt provide good customer service to third party website users. I highly doubt this is Hilton‚Äôs policy. I informed her that I was also a Hilton honors member.

"They put me in a room where only boil hot water was coming out of the shower, maintenance guy came to check and he left without saying anything
Then we had to go to the receptionist to request a room change, we were changed to a room where the AC was not working properly and making loud noises
I would not recommend this hotel",2,Eddy,2024-06-07
Everything was good. It was just so hot in Austin that we couldn‚Äôt cool our room down. ,10,Cynthia,2024-06-07
AC was very weak and probably struggling with the heat but the temperature in the room couldn't have been colder than 80 degrees.  There was also a very heavy musty/moldy smell coming from the vents with the AC on and it was overwhelming.  Had to switch rooms and my colleague switched rooms twice before we had to switch hotels.  Ladies at the front desk did everything they could to accommodate and were very sweet but I just think the HVAC system needs an overhaul,4,Verified traveler,2024-06-06

"I NEVER right a review but I had to this time. It had to have been the worst hotel that I‚Äôve stayed at. The pictures are not honest. The hotel did not look at all like what was in the picture. The area is not great with homeless walking around outside, mattresses and debris on the curb and dumpster trash seeping into the parking lot. Inside was damp and humid so I knew already that the a/c was going to be an issue in the rooms. When we got into the room it smelled immediately. It was a mixture of cigarettes and moldy. We were there less than 5 minutes and the ceiling was leaking. They came to clean it but when they unclogged whatever it was, the room smelled of feces, which again was frustrating. The man was very nice, said her fixed it but the ceiling leaked the whole weekend. The shower had some plastic pc pipe coming out of the ceiling from the floor above us. It was creepy. We all tried to sleep but woke up in the middle of the night, sticky and sweaty. Then we were going to go to the pool area but was told by another frustrated guest that it was filthy in there and that dog feces was left in the pool. I would‚Äôve left but it was non refundable. We just got home and am washing all of our clothes just in case there were bed bugs because this place was dirty, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. ",2,rosalinda,2024-06-02

"It was hot in our room so they moved us to another room that was equally hot. The new room was dirty and disgusting, still have a dirty diaper and a rag full of makeup and hair. The toilet was so dirty. It was disgusting. I will never ever book with embassy again!",2,Guadalupe,2024-05-28
Hot! Hot! Hot!  The room never cooled off the entire time we were there. Thermostat was set to 60 but didn‚Äôt feel close to 60. Felt more like 72 to 75. Fan blew the whole time so if you stood in front of it you were ok. If not don‚Äôt move around too much. The lobby and the eating area were not very cold either when we were there. Numerous people fanning themselves with menus at the managers reception. Don‚Äôt know if AC at hotel just wasn‚Äôt working or they have it set a certain way and there is nothing you can do about it. Really looking forward to relaxing in a cool room since the temp the day we checked in was in the upper 90‚Äôs. No such luck. ,6,Dennis,2024-05-28
"My wife attempted to call guest services and the front desk,  no answer,  after 20 minutes she went down and spoke to someone about the issue.
After 30 more minutes and no one coming to fix the issue,  I went down and spoke to Magali H ( that is what she wrote on the card)  I wanted another room,  she informed me that there were none available.    I asked to speak to someone else and she told me no one else was available.  She used your name,  I asked about getting someone to look at the AC,  she did not respond.  
This is when it becomes apparent that the customer is not correct.
I made sure that she understood that I wanted someone to fix the problem or change the room.  She did not respond.

I got her name,  went to the room and called your office leaving a message which you have not returned.

Two maintenance people looked at the unit,  no relief,  I was brought 2 fans.   

Here in lies the issues 
The softball team that was there for 4 days had to have people moved because of AC issues so you know it is an issue,  and you still overbook or you put people in the room and charge 216.00 to sweat.
Then when I see the bathroom after maintenance has worked on the unit it is a mess.  And here is where your maintenance guys lie.  The Unit was froze,  because it leaks water,  so much the door has rust,  drips on you when using the toilet,  which I have pictures of,  more than willing to share with your boss.

So you know it is a problem,  do it anyway and then basically say tough",2,James,2024-05-28
"First night we were put in a room with a queen bed instead of a king bed suite and was told to show proof I booked a king bed suite. Then people were in the open area til almost 4 in the morning talking, laughing and drinking being very loud so we got very little sleep including my toddler. Then we were moved the next day but AC did not work well‚Ä¶ when asked for them
To clean our room the following room they only made the bed and did not leave toilet paper or towels and did not make the pull out couch. The water stopped working and the two women at the front desk were so rude. Then our daughter left her stuff animal she has had since she was a baby and there was no care from the staff to help look for it. We were told that rooms were cleaned and it wasn‚Äôt there and they wouldn‚Äôt let us look. We had to look for house keeping on our own to ask for help. Staff was rude and not helpful. I would not recommend staying here ",2,erica,2024-05-28
"The hotel was nice on the inside, outdated on the outside. The breakfast was an elite breakfast with multiple tasty options.

The only major issue I had was that my rooms ac unit was not working properly, I had it set to 60 but it was around 80 degrees and humid on the inside of the room, I called the front desk and they said they would send the engineer up but never did. Then the next morning I was asking other guests if they were having similar issues and every one of them said yes it was warm. Then upon checking out I seen multiple rooms having box fans set outside their rooms so it made me think this is an ongoing issue.

Also they make you pay for parking on their property which is weird to me $18.


So if you do decide to stay, it‚Äôs a great hotel despite the couple of upsets I had dealt with. Just call and ask to make sure their AC is working properly prior to staying there.",4,Corey,2024-05-27

"On Wednesday afternoon when I checked in I unpacked and needed to get showered and over to a work meeting within the hour. I could not get any cold water out of the shower. No matter how long I let it run, no matter the position I put the handle in I could only get hot water. The water was so hot it was almost unbearable to utilize. I start pumping the body wash and it is completely empty. Doubly whammy within moments of each other. After getting dressed I went to the counter and reported the hot water situation. The front desk person said that they would send maintenance in the to repair it while I was gone. At that moment I also mentioned that the body wash in the shower was empty. Front desk person said, ‚ÄúIll add it to the list but my housekeeping crew is gone for the day so they will fill it tomorrow when they go through the room.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have time to push back but really?! 

Jump into the shower on Thursday morning and guess what‚Ä¶still a scalding hot shower. No cold water available no matter the position of the handle. Also‚Ä¶no shower gel.

A/C in the room never properly cooled and the fan would only go on auto. I did notice that the backup line is dripping in the tub which is warning sign that something is wrong with HVAC.

"Hotel is definitely in decline and needs to update staff and maintenance. Upon check-in we were informed parking is $14 to park in a sketchy parking lot with many homeless people wandreing around. The suite we booked was acceptable on first glance until the ac came on. It sounded like a drill running in the ductwork. The hotel sent up a maintenance man who told us ""the bearing were out"" and brought us a box fan to attempt to drown out the ac noise. Front desk staff told me the hotel was booked solid so they couldn't switch me rooms and that ""you probably don't want to try to get a refund, because it's not worth the trouble"". The bed covers had holes in them, the bathroom was dirty, and lights in the room were minimal. One of the elevators is broken so there were times where it was a 15-20 minute wait for the elecator.

When we arrived to the pool with our two children there were at least 20  people attending the party of one or two actual guests. It was overcrowded and there was no regards to the facility rules as far as sanitary measures, food and open beverages (including liquor). Our kids did their best to hold their own corner and the managers did seem to clear out the party eventually.

The next day when we used the pool the water quality seemed really unsanitary. Understandable as anyone who maintains pools knows that after a large capacity party with contaminants like food the water requires a good cleaning but still gross.

That evening the power went out. It was for a short amount of time, but enough time to kick off our A/C and leave us sweltering. 

Apart from that one of the elevators near our room was broken the entire time leading to erratic wait times after a really unsettling ride before the other one was officially declared broken.

Overall the staff, reception and breakfast were 10/10 but the property facilities themselves left much to be desired.

"The ambiance of the hotel was great...a little loud with the kids around, but was during the day so it wasn't a big deal. The room i had was lovely, but the living room area was rather large, and the bathroom could've been a bit bigger. Bathrooms definitively need a plumbing upgrade. When i showered, the drain took a while to go down. Also, a sink in every room was really not necessary. Otherwise...my stay was comfortable and i would consider staying at this location again.

"Check-in with Emily was great. Once we got to our room we recognized this wasn't the room we booked through Expedia. I went back down to the front desk to get the issue resolved but before I could even finish my sentence I was rudely interrupted by Sam. She looked at my phone and stated ""The amount you paid isn't for that specific room."" I let her know that I used Expedia points which lowered the rate. She then stated that she called the manager Mark and that he stated that the room could not be changed. My wife then walked over to attempt to explain what was going on but Sam then threatened to call the cops because we were being ""unruly"" and that we would not be refunded the cost of the room. After attempting to get her to let us speak we then walked over to Emily, who had checked us in, to explain what was going on. Sam then stormed over to where we were demanding that Emily come to the back and speak with her first. Emily stated that she would but after she spoke with us. While Emily was helping us, Sam went to the back and came out and demanded that Emily stop what she was doing to come and speak with Mark on the phone. We were able to speak with Emily and explain to her what was going on and show her the Expedia confirmation with the room that we booked. She stated that she saw that the room that we booked was not the same one that Expedia had us down for but unfortunately, there were no available rooms so ultimately, the issue had to be resolved with Expedia.

Then during breakfast the waiters were very rude to me and my guest. We felt so uncomfortable we stayed the night elsewhere and returned the next morning for our bags and had the rude front desk people starring with mean faces . Once we gathered our belongings we noticed the workers came in the room and stole a purse also charged me an additional $116 because he stated your company never paid and threatened with police when I asked for a refund and he said to go through hotels.com and accused us of stealing . Once I entered my vehicle I noticed it was also vandalized with missing expensive merchandise as well I recorded a lot of the incident and he even gave other people privileges that I had been given as well but was refused to receive from their employees.

When I contacted the front desk they told me I would have to request this service in advance and that all of their locations are requiring this.  My room was not cleaned and I was not told about this when we checked in.

Also, in the breakfast area, dining area and where they had the snacks for the evening social there were numerous flys landing on everything.  ",6,Verified traveler,2023-06-12

Chose this property solely for the pool and hot tub. born of which were unbearably cold to the point where i couldn‚Äôt use them. not just the water but the entire room was freezing which i guess is why it was completely empty on a weekend when the hotel was full of kids and families. They had to move us to a different room as well because the AC/heat was broken and there was black mold all along the ceiling along the bed. smelled absolutely horrible in that first room as well. ,6,emily,2023-04-11

"This hotel is not in a very nice part of town. Not the hotel's fault, of course, but something to consider. There is virtually nothing appealing to walk to in the area, so expect to drive everywhere.
Our room was not exactly 'clean' (empty water bottle and cap on the floor) and smelled musty. The only light in the 'suite' area came from a single, dim bulb in a standing lamp and the high hat over the sink. No clock anywhere in the suite, and one of the TV remote controls was non-functional.
The bathroom was very small, with visible rust on metal fixtures and peeling paint on the ceiling. I'd expect better, even from a 3 star hotel.
VERY annoying was the fact that one of the two elevators on our side of the building was out of service for our entire trip. It was Easter weekend and the hotel was packed. Ten floors of guests and just one working elevator for half of the place. 
Also - no extra blanket for the bed, and a single extra pillow in the closet, without a pillowcase. Not only is there no daily housekeeping option, their policy is that they will NOT even clean your room during your stay unless you are there for more than 4 nights. WTH? Do they even care?
One more quibble - although the hotel's website clearly states that there is a daily charge for parking, if you Google Map this hotel, one of the amenities listed is 'Free Parking'. I complained about this and was comp'd for 3 nights of the parking fee.
We are not generally fussy people, but this place is terrible.",4,Charles,2023-04-11

"This was not what I expected. Let me just list all of the things that did NOT work/didn't make sense. 
1.) The jacuzzi and heated tub were out of order
2.) The second elevator on our side of the building was out of order
3.) The laundry room was out of order
4.) The advertisement mentioned a basketball court/there was NO basketball court
5.) We booked a room with 2 Queen beds, we got a room with one Queen bed and a pull out couch
6.) The fridge and microwave were not plugged in. After having my fianc√© pull out the fridge and microwave from the wall, we noticed that both plugs would not fit on one outlet. So you have a choice of either having a microwave or a fridge. You can't have both unless you move the fridge across the room to another plug away from the kitchen.
7.) We could see that they obviously did not care about the maintenance of the building because the air filters were too small for the air intake, meaning they don't filter the air effectively. I guarantee they will be replacing that soon. 
8.) There's only ice machines from the 3rd floor up, so if you're on floor 1 or 2, you have to wait 10 minutes for the only working elevator to get ice.
Needless to say we paid entirely too much money to stay at this hotel. It was clearly false advertising when you account for everything that was broken/unavailable. Will not be staying here again.
The only thing I liked was the cool looking common area/bar and the free breakfast in the morning.

"Very disappointed in the service.  I called the morning of our check in day and asked about early checkin.  Was told it would be available 1130-12.  Get there and was told to come back around 1.  Came back and then told there wasn‚Äôt any available.  Came back at 530(1 1/2 hours AFTER check in time) and our room was still not ready.  The manager was very nice and accommodating but we had planned out day from out of town around the early check in and to still not have a room well after check in time, that was just ridicukous.

"Came into town for Austin City Limits Music Festival. The location was perfect, it was near all the places we frequent. I traveled with a large group (we each had multiple rooms) and everyone had a pleasant experience. The suites were an added bonus as we had 4 people in our party, it was spacious and there was plenty of room for everyone to spread about and be comfortable. The breakfast was a wonderful surprise and they also had happy hour each day of our stay (included alcoholic drinks and hors d‚Äôoeuvres). The indoor pool was awesome, we even had it all to ourselves the first evening, even though the hotel was fully booked. We felt comfortable, safe, and at home during our 4 day stay. It was well worth the price !!

"I feel like I was robbed, because I could have rented a room in another hotel, for less than I paid for with better results. One of the reasons why we selected this hotel was because of the indoor pool, which is being remodeled and cannot be used, but in the ads they do not say anything about it, the rooms are old, with the smell of humidity, neglected, the heating did not work, we had to turn it off, we notified it but they never did anything. I have photos to test what I say.",4,Marco,2023-02-12

Found out once we arrived that we had to pay for parking. Hilton has officially become the Spirit Airlines of hotels. We were charged $5 for a 12oz can of 7Up at the gift shop and as well as $8 for a small roll of Tums. I no longer think of Hilton as being a hotel I want to stay at. We checked out a day early because we were just turned off by it all.,2,Christy,2023-02-06

"It was OK and worked for our needs. However, the room was in need of serious updating. Furniture and bathroom were old and well used. 

The bathroom shower had mold on the ceiling. 

We had 1 extra person in our room sleeping on the couch. There were no sheets or extra blanket in the room for it so we called to have them brought up. 45 mins passed and still nothing, so we called again. They came right up at that point. When we opened the door, they threw in a large black garbage bag with sheets, blanket and extra towels, and left. They said nothing, just threw it in and gone. 

The staff at check-in was also not very pleasant. As we approached the desk to check in, the person was leaving but turned around to help us. But she was very rude, with an attitude that almost felt like we were bothering her. ",6,Sherri,2023-02-01
"Adequate, not great. The room was clean, but there was a small
pile of trash by the elevator that no one removed for the 6 days I stayed there. One of the sinks in our room did't drain- we notified the staff but nothing was done about it.

"The hotel is clean, and the lobby is nice. The rooms, however, are very dated and dark. Basic amenities and nothing fancy. I stayed here because I attended a conference being held there.

The breakfast buffet had a decent selection as did the restaurant/bar.

Overall a 2.5-3 star experience.",6,Verified traveler,2023-01-31

"The place is ok, but dated . Staff is very disorganized, and some rude and with an attitude. We booked a week ahead and when we got there, they told us they didn‚Äôt have the room we booked and they will have to give us a different one or we can get a refund, meaning we‚Äôll be without a room in an unknown city. However, after expressing our discomfort they found our room. 

Everything when well after this, in regards of our stay but after we left my card started showing unauthorized charges. I called and they said it was a system error, it will go away a couple of days later. A couple of days later I got a charge for $85.75. We spent this amount at the bar, but we paid there with my husbands card not with my card on file, so basically they double charged us. When I called about it‚Äî again, the receptionist was extremely rude, she said she will transferred me to the manager. After awhile she picked up and said ‚Äîyou‚Äôre still on the line? ok I‚Äôll just go ahead and refunded because it‚Äôs easier for me to do that than waited for the bar to pick up ( so she never transferred me with a manager) So I asked, so you can see the double charged now, she said no, I‚Äôm just going to trust your word, so I commented that they were a very disorganized hotel and she hanged up on me.  I will not recommend this place. There‚Äôs way nicer hotels with a better location for the same price. I have not received my refund yet, nor is even pending.",2,Daniela,2023-01-28

"Antes de reservar siempre leo los comentarios para darme una idea perfecta de el hotel y lei que les habian cobrado el depodito de 100 dolares y no lo habian reembolsado pero les di el beneficio y reserve ., Cual fue mi sorpresa que no solo no me regresaron el deposito si no que me hicieron 2 cobros !!!  Uno al momento de hacer el check inn y al momento de hacer el check out otro pero ya sin el importe del deposito ... Cuando hicimos el check out les pregunte si me regresaban el deposito y me fijeron que era en automatico y que el banco podria tardar 2 o tres dias en regresarlo ... Regredo de mi viaje hago mis cuentas y veo los 2 cargos uno el 24 de diciembre y otro el 26 de diciembre y hoy 12 de Enero  sigo esperando mi reembolso lo que se me hace un robo total !!!",2,Mary Carmen,2023-01-12

Hotel is old but clean. Faucets need attention as they drip and the toilet in my room didn‚Äôt flush properly so at least my room had plumbing issues. The breakfast was great and the staff very friendly. There is a parking fee at this location not sure if that was mentioned on the booking site.

"I would have give better rate, but room smelled like humidity. Pancakes were over cooked, they were toasted. But what did got to my nerves,  at 8am roof workers started to do a horrible noise. I couldn't rest the last couple hours. If this was planned, why giving me a room at the 10th and last floor. They were working on top of my room. Next time someone will do a job there, do not make people to spend money that cost a lot to earned if they are no going to have the complete stay peacefully and quite. Other than that it was nice.",6,Luis,2023-01-06

"We brought our dog, which was a mistake. I wasn't aware of the $75 pet fee, I couldn't find the additional charge anywhere on the hotels.com profile. I was a little surprised but that's ok. I think what really bugged me was that the walls are kind of thin. Right next door they were shooting fireworks on New Years eve(which i know isn't anyone's fault) but the whole wall facing the fireworks was glass, and the curtains did nothing to cancel the noise. It was a clean hotel with great service, but i dunno if we will be back with the dog lol",6,Catherine,2023-01-03

The Wi-Fi issue never got fixed, and the first floor looks nice but going up it looked like the hotel was falling apart by our elevator the ceiling was literally falling down. The only good thing about the hotel was the omelet bar, the other breakfast was cold. Will not be staying here again very disappointed. The area didn‚Äôt feel safe at all it‚Äôs just an old hotel with an updated bar and breakfast area.
