"Staff was awful, a throw back to 1984, dirty, nasty! Rooms were up dated but just ok. Would NOT recommend! ",4,Robert,2025-09-28
"This place was questionable mainly because the price was so inexpensive.  When I arrived I parked in the basement garage and thought it was small and maybe I‚Äôm no allowed to park there.  When I check i. The attendant was so nice and quick.  Or room was way better than the pics.  I thought we had a rioom with 2 queen beds but ended up with a top floor too
 With a king size bed and jacuzzii tub!  What a surprise and a balcony overlooking the ocean!  The AC worked great and we had a fridge that was so cold!  I have no complaints at all.  The staff was friendly and polite.  We had a wonderful stay for 3 days!  Don‚Äôt think twice about coming here.  It is close to everything!  We took advantage of that!",10,Timothy,2025-09-28
"Everything was perfect for us. The staff was super friendly, clean and quiet. We really liked being on the beach and near the boardwalk. It was great. Thank you.",10,Francois,2025-09-27
"Shopping options for beach souvenirs were good.  View was exceptional.  Did not interact with staff much, but they never asked was everything ok or about our stay there.  Hallway lights were burned out at night making it unsafe and the entire hotel needs some updating.  Would not be my choice in future",6,Sharon O.,2025-09-27
The room was much cleaner and fresher than the lobby or halls appeared. The view was spectacular though. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better room with a view. We were right at the 17th street pier. The Staff was good and friendly. The only downside was that breakfast was not offered. Only coffee was available but the machine offered many brew options and grinder fresh beans for each cup. ,10,Janet,2025-09-25
"The room was spacious, had a view of sunrise and sunset!  The Murphy bed was a fun surprise, my son loved it.

The balcony on the 7th floor was a fun place to watch the beach and boardwalk.  And we were given a wonderful air show.  Formations of fighters right over the roof.

The kitchen we didn't use was the only actually dirty place, the shower was unimpressive.  Pool was closed, couldn't find the beach access, had to leave the hotel from the parking lot driveway.

It was a good deal and we had a wonderful couple of days",6,Hector,2025-09-24

"Breakers is great for a quick getaway. Beachfront balconies. Great views. I cannot comment on the service.  My wife and put the do not disturb sign up for our 4 night stay and that was it.  All we needed were fresh towels which the room had plenty.  Honestly we picked this place because it has rooms with HOT TUB‚Äôs, surrounded by mirrors, that has a beach view.  Great for a romantic getaway. Dining options everywhere. Walkable.  We had a wonderful time.  Don‚Äôt expect a 5 star resort.  This is an old outdated hotel.  But most importantly it‚Äôs clean.  Has great views and very Clean Hot tubs.  ",8,David,2025-09-23

"We travel a lot and book a lot of hotels... but this was our worst hotel ever in our career, and we have seen some. A hotel with an exorbitant price ($800 Canadian for one night) that doesn't even have the respect to maintain its rooms, they are awful and completely ruined (see photos) The hotel has nine floors and when we arrived on site it wasn't working... imagine! We had 6 floors to climb with a child and all the luggage. I am requesting a full refund for my room because I am outraged by the price and the maintenance of this building which is surely becoming dangerous...",2,Michel,2025-09-03
The queen beds were nice and the bathroom was clean.  The pool was convenient.  The hotel was on the boardwalk with an oceanfront balcony.  The soda and snack machines were on 2 different floors and I had to ask where they were two times to find them.  The staff seemed bothered by me asking questions.  The location was convenient.,8,Paula,2025-09-03

The location is PERFECT.  The hotel was nice.... .the room was very nice.  They did have an elevator issue 1 evening...... and had trouble opening the room door a few times but after several tries it worked.  All in all i would recommend...... but little things would have a big impact.  I Having a small breakfast would be nice.... they have an area for this that had nothing but coffee......   Some of the staff seemed not very friendly.,6,TIMOTHY,2025-09-02

"The pool was tiny no air-conditioning in hall ways other areas, elevator broke had to walk up and down 9 flights of stairs had no breakfast and the water pressure was horrible could barely  take a shower also it took forever  to fill the hot tub in room ",2,Sharon,2025-09-01

"The view is good, the room was just okay. There is no restaurant or bar nothing in the hotel! They do not give late checkouts so if you‚Äôre flying that could be an issue, the hallways are dirty and very hot! There‚Äôs no vending machines with water pop anything! Just one for snacks! ",6,Renee,2025-09-01
"We booked 2 rooms as adjoining rooms. Get there to check in and one room is on the 2nd floor, other room is on the 5th floor. They would not put our rooms together, even though it was booked and called to verify. Get to the room and we are greeted with this horrible smell, it looks like someone has puked all down the wall behind the couch, the stove and counter is covered in food crumbs, the microwave works but doesn‚Äôt get warm, the blinds in the kitchenette looked like they got into a fight with an angry cat and lost, the light above the bathroom mirror doesn‚Äôt work, the exhaust fan doesn‚Äôt work, the beds squeaked annoyingly every time you rolled over, the windows to the balcony are covered in hand prints on one side and butt check prints on the other side, there was mold all along the edge of the shower and dirt all along the edges of the wall in the bathroom. When I informed them about this, I was told ‚Äúok‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôll be ok‚Äù. When I checked out, the lady working was very upset to hear this, so it was nice that someone cared, but we won‚Äôt be back. There‚Äôs tons of doors to walk through just to get to the extremely tiny hall for the elevator, which makes it difficult when you‚Äôre trying to walk in with all of your baggage. The only way to access the beach is to go out the front door and walk around the building. That wasn‚Äôt an issue for us, but did feel bad for the elderly couple and the wheelchair bound individual. House keeping was polite and helpful. ",4,Dawn,2025-09-01

"To make a long story short, I was very disappointed and disturbed.    Had a 4 day 3 night stay in a room with a kitchen, and killed around 10 roaches while others escaped.  The only reason I stayed, the room had 3 queen beds and the roaches were only spotted in the kitchen.  Upon leaving, I shook every Item and luggage making sure nothing came home with me,  Also, when asked about an Iron for my room that had an iron board. I was told, they didn't have an extra one, I could wait for someone to bring it from their other hotel. ...smh",6,Nichole,2025-08-26

"The building was not inviting. It needs to be renovated. It had a smell from the lobby through the hallway to the elevator. It looked outdated. I was  very disappointed because the website painted a different picture. The elevator was dirty, the hallway to my room was not clean and it smelled. I stayed
only a half of a night, my daughter has asthma and she couldn‚Äôt tolerate the terrible smell of the hotel. We contemplated staying in our vehicle until sun rise. It was that bad. I got my refund and booked Comfort Suites which was a lot cleaner and nicer.",4,Verified traveler,2025-08-23
The room we had reserved was really hyped up online. We were a little disappointed in how the room actually looked and how it showed a kitchenette and all we got was mini fridge and microwave. This was my first time back to VA beach since my childhood and I wasn‚Äôt impressed. We will be more careful looking next time. We did enjoy the view!,6,Denichia,2025-08-20

"Arrived a bit early, tried to check in the younger girl at the desk was absolutely against it. We did get our parking pass and she said we could use the pool or visit the ocean. We visited the ocean and by the time we came back a younger man was at the desk and was more than happy to check us in early. He was the nicest of all the people who worked the front desk. The others were flat out rude and you could tell they hated their job or dealing with people or both. The older guy with glasses would huff and puff when we went to get the free coffee offered in the closed restaurant part. He even told us if we wanted coffee our room had a coffee pot. That was truly uncalled for. We had the family suite which was suitable for our family of 6. Only issue was after we went to the grocery store ants invaded the kitchen. I had to throw so much food away but lesson learned store food elsewhere. There is lots of room for upgrades to the hotel especially for the nightly price we paid. The outdoor pool advertises that it‚Äôs heated but was like an ice bath. The location was ok. There is a decent sized hill you have to walk up and down to get to the beach or the sidewalk to visit shops, it was a huge inconvenience as I use a cane. There is only one elevator for 9 floors and a basement. The other guests we met were friendly and nice. Beds were comfortable and we NO housekeeping for our 5 nite stay. When we needed towels, trash bags, toilet paper we had to go to the front desk and get it. ",6,Tiffany,2025-08-12
The hotel room that sleep 8 was dated definitely need to trash those old chairs in the rooms but I must say it was very clean and the location is amazing when you look out your window you see the pier if you walk to the other window you will see the little amusement park the location is great ,8,Eleshia,2025-08-12

Over all the location was good and a nice view ocean front plus the front desk management was very polite and tired to help us since when we reserved a room we thought we were getting a suite with a kitchen and our room didn‚Äôt have a kitchen and the photos on Expedia was misleading when we made the reservation . Next time we will reserve directly from the hotel web site and reserve the penthouse suite and also the house keeping was extremely nice.  Other then an older hotel everything was good other then our ac in the room wasn‚Äôt cooling well at all and we didn‚Äôt bother complaining since they were booked.  ,8,Maria,2025-08-10

We called about it and maintenance came and looked and said yes there was an issue and couldn‚Äôt do anything about it.  Tried to get moved to another room, but nothing available. Called and had to request a shower curtain because we did not have one.  And waited over an hour for it, but had to go to the front desk and ask again.  And it‚Äôs suppose to be smoke free, but it was a constant smell of vapes, cigarettes and other.  Stains on bedding. Front desk didn‚Äôt care at all about any of this when I told them at check out.

There‚Äôs only one elevator always extremely hot. Don‚Äôt offer early check-in.,6,Melissa,2025-07-21
"Stayed here for one night and honestly, it was not worth the $500 price tag. The room had cracked and chipped tiles around the bathtub, and the ceiling was covered in poorly done patch jobs. The walls are paper thin‚Äîyou can hear everything happening in neighboring rooms, which made it hard to relax.

The hallways were uncomfortably hot, easily over 90 degrees, and there‚Äôs only one elevator, which means you‚Äôll be waiting 10+ minutes just to get to your floor. Parking is another issue. They charge $10, but the lot was full, so I had to park elsewhere and walk back to the hotel.

On the positive side, the place felt safe and I didn‚Äôt see any bugs, but that‚Äôs about where the positives end. This hotel either needs a full remodel or a significant price drop. Not worth the premium they‚Äôre charging in its current condition.",4,Verified traveler,2025-07-20

Hotel has potential, just needs a little work. Pool is small but gets the job done. Location was great for being at the boardwalk. Nice that there was a lower level parking to keep the car cool.

"The hotel is convenient to shopping, great food choices and things to do. Several of the staff members were very nice and helpful. Several were not. The parking is not convenient at all and parking per night is extra. I was not aware of that until I checked in. One evening when we returned there were no parking spaces and we were directed to a different lot next door. (Back to the main road, take a left and then another left) very inconvenient and when you‚Äôre paying for a parking space, you expect a parking space! 
The ice machine area smelled awful - like urine. The pillows are very thin. Bring your own from home if possible! Overall, the hotel is dated and there were some glitches, but in a convenient location. ",6,Karen,2025-06-25

When I made my reservation thru Hotels.com they charged me for two rooms and it only supposed to be one room for one night. It took 2hrs to check in plus it took me a while to get thru to experian since I booked thru them. The front desk clerk was new so he didnt know much. I had to wait 30 plus minutes for someone to come in and fix the issue! Than when I checked out the next day the hotel tried to add additional charges  I had to call my C.C. company and they reported as fraud because I didnt authorize the charge. FYI they don't take cash and they charge for parking. like really?! ,6,angela,2025-06-20

We were in town for a National wrestling tournament 2 coaches and 4 high school boys. The family double room was spacious and roomy for our crew. Everything was clean and staff was friendly. The hotel is a bit older and could use some renovation but nothing taking away from comfort and cleanliness. Perfect spot as it is on the beach and central of all the strip and boardwalk.

"I loved the fact that it had enough beds for my 2 kids not to share, and a kitchenette.  The room smelled slightly musty but at least it didn‚Äôt smell like smoke.  There were no forks in the room so I asked the front desk lady and she apologized but they had no forks left‚Ä¶ okay‚Ä¶ the hotel guests were fairly quiet, the road outside could be noisy but that‚Äôs not the hotels fault.  The bed was okay but I wish their pillows were not so flat, I woke up with a neck crick.  The blackout curtains didn‚Äôt totally close so a little sun came in, but the blinds in the living room/kitchen were ineffective for my kid on the Murphy bed. The elevator was slow, be prepared to wait.  The outdoor furniture was not beach chairs as I thought and was instead pool loungers‚Ä¶.Overall it was a good stay (1 night), and would stay again for a short trip, it was a good location, we loved the balcony and the view.

"Start with hotel was clean, there was a leftiver corona cap on the balcony and what looked like some bottle foil on the room floor. Sheets had a few blemishes, but you can tell they were washed. I saw people complain about balcony door, you just got to give the handle a little jiggle then it completely shuts just fine. The bed was the proper size, but not the most comfortable( not bad for a short stay) the jacuzzi did not have hot water right after it was done filling it was warm at best( but operated fine) and fit two decently. If the wife and I were a bit bigger we wouldnt have fit together. VB after 10pm with the weather having been nice is wild, literal shootout right outside the hotel ducked behind cars by their smoking area, because the staff was reluctant to let us back in while it was happening.

"I was extremely disappointed that the jacuzzi tub in this ‚Äúdeluxe suite ‚Äú did not work, as it is supposed to be the highlight of the room. I had trouble with the key cards to open the door to the room. It took several tries before they worked to open the door. Also the restaurant was closed and I wasn‚Äôt made aware of that until I arrived. ",4,Kathryn,2024-09-22

"I have stayed at the Breakers the last few years. My only concern about staying there was the elevator.  Last year,it was broke the whole time we were there.  This year no problems.

We selected this property because of the ocean view and the view was beautiful. Our room was clean and comfortable. All staff we had interactions with were friendly. The young lady at the front desk was very sweet and friendly and the one young man that worked the afternoon shift. The head house keeper was wonderful. The only negatives were that there was only 1 elevator for the entire inn and the building is dated. However the beds were comfortable and clean. We would return,8,Susan,2024-07-25
The property was in an excellent location  very convenient to everything. Staffwas always friendly and courteous.The parking sucked there wasnt enough the way it was setup they did have a parking lot next door but you had to go all way around to get to hotel. The parking in lower level was a bit sketchy. No breakfast offered i feel every hotel should have a continental breakfast.Also coffee and tea should be offered in lobby. Other then that a great stay very pretty view to be able to look out at ocean. I would stay here again.,10,Jennifer,2024-07-24
"I was partially concerned about the status of the hotel after reading the reviews, but decided to give it a go.  The hotel is dated, but my room was clean.

"Overall our stay was enjoyable.   The rooms were clean and large and the balcony was nice.  The common areas however from the hallways to the elevator were stifling HOT!!  Absolutely no air conditioning was turned on.  
The morning coffee bar was closed more than it was open and the pool was also closed more than it was open.  Staff were friendly but definitely did not go out of their way to provide a welcoming atmosphere.   The price for our rooms should have provided A  service and accommodations.  Our next stay at VA Beach will not be at this establishment. ",6,George,2024-07-07

"On our stay the first morning the smoke alarms started going off and stayed going off for about a half hour . 
Then the elevators broke down and stopped working for the entirety of the day on Saturday 6/8/24 and me and my wife had to go up 5 flights of very small stairs with bags and beach chairs etc so you know that was horrible dealing with that . 
On top of if we paid all this money for these luxury things in the room and get there and the maintenance guy is still inside the room when we arrive, he then says he wasn‚Äôt done and needed to take the safe out b/c he didn‚Äôt install it right on the wall and had to be taken out and me and my wife couldn‚Äôt keep any personal items protected at all. 
 The jacuzzi in the bathroom was so slow to fill up it took almost an entire hour to get filled up to the line for the jacuzzi to work then by that time the excitement was pretty much gone so then we go to turn it on and it didn‚Äôt even work smh. Hallways were filthy and cleaners didn‚Äôt touch them at all the entire time we were there . I cannot believe I had to spend that much money for this room . 6/7-6/9/24

"First of upon entering the property I greeted the receptionist she did not answer I greeted her again still no answer then she looked at me as said in a very rude tone how may I help you I told her I‚Äôm a guest at the hotel and I know am early is there a fee for early checked in customers also I have my car parked outside what‚Äôs the procedure than she started talking asking my name etc that part went ok, I just want her to know that no matter the color of someone‚Äôs skin or looks that person can be a customer. What if I was the owner and she did not knew I‚Äôm sure she would have been fired after that. The room smells like mold the face basin water took a while to run out and it keep smelling I had to find a dollar store to get some disinfectant to keep pouring finally I told the guy on the evening shift,  he sent persons to fixed it immediately. He always asked if we were ok and if we needed anything to let him know. The sink was moldy and stink the bathtub also when showering the water was taking forever to go down, the vent in the bathroom was clouded with dirt and the entire bathroom smelled really bad. I paid for three nights I only spent two I will never go back to that hotel again the carpet on floor was dirty and I‚Äôm sure how they clean these places. ",2,Gillian,2024-06-06

I appreciate the guy at the desk trying to fix the situation. But during check in they gave me a dirty room. They later switch my room but getting in there the ac only blew out hot air. Luckily i spent most the day outside so i diddy have to deal with it til it was time to sleep. Pretty much stayed up the whole night cause i could never get comfortable. This is usually my favorite hotel because me and my wife enjoyed the jacuzzi. ,2,Dontray,2024-05-27
